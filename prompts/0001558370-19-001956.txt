 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 MMA Capital Holdings, Inc. invests in debt associated with renewable energy infrastructure and real estate. Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “MMA,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to MMA Capital Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We were originally organized as a Delaware limited liability company in 1996 and converted to a Delaware corporation on January 1, 2019. 
 We focus on investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns that generate positive environmental or social impacts, with an emphasis on renewable energy debt investments. Our assets and liabilities are organized into two portfolios:

· | Energy Capital – This portfolio consists primarily of investments that we have made through joint ventures with an institutional capital partner in loans that finance renewable energy projects; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Assets and Liabilities (“OA&L”) – This portfolio includes our investments in bonds and related financing, certain loan receivables, cash, real estate-related investments, subordinated debt and the balance of the Company’s assets and liabilities (at December 31, 2018, investments in bonds and related financing, which were previously identified as their own portfolio in each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that was filed in 2018, were reallocated to the OA&L portfolio).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In emphasizing renewable energy debt investments, our objective is to grow the Company’s return on equity by further recycling equity out of existing investments, such as bond-related investments with premiums that will otherwise decrease with the passage of time and other assets that are generating lower returns, into the Energy Capital portfolio, which we believe will generate higher returns.
 Commencing on January 8, 2018, we became externally managed by Hunt Investment Management, LLC (our “External Manager”), an affiliate of Hunt Companies, Inc. (Hunt Companies, Inc. and its affiliates are hereinafter referred to as “Hunt”), which is an investment adviser registered with the United States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In conjunction with this change, we completed the sale of the following businesses and assets to Hunt (this sale transaction is hereinafter referred to as the “Disposition”):

· | our Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) business;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | our international asset and investment management business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | the loan origination, servicing and management components of our Energy Capital business (including certain management, expense reimbursement and other contractual rights that were held by the Company with respect to this business line);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our bond servicing platform; and
--+---------------------------------


· | certain miscellaneous investments.
--+-----------------------------------

  On October 4, 2018, Hunt exercised its option as set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement dated January 8, 2018, between the Company and Hunt, to take assignment of the Company’s agreements to acquire (i) the LIHTC business of Morrison Grove Management, LLC (“MGM”) and (ii) certain assets pertaining to a specific LIHTC property from affiliates of MGM (these agreements are collectively referred hereinafter to as the “MGM Agreements”). In connection with the closing of the MGM Agreements, the Company executed a series of additional transactions completing the Company’s disposition of its MGM and LIHTC related assets. Such transactions are further discussed below within “Interests in MGM” and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 13, “Related Party Transactions and Transactions with Affiliates.”
 Given these changes to our business model and effective the first quarter of 2018, we operate as a single reporting segment. As a result, we no longer operate, or present the results of our operations, through three reportable segments that, as of December 31, 2017, included U.S. Operations, International Operations and Corporate Operations.

 Energy Capital Portfolio
 Overview
 In our Energy Capital portfolio, we invest in loans that finance renewable energy projects to enable developers, design and build contractors and system owners to develop, build and operate renewable energy systems throughout North America. These loans include late-stage development, construction and permanent loans. We typically invest in these loans directly  through Renewable Energy Lending, LLC (“REL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, or with an institutional capital partner in multiple ventures that include: Solar Construction Lending, LLC (“SCL”); Solar Permanent Lending, LLC (“SPL”) and Solar Development Lending, LLC (“SDL”) (REL, SCL, SPL and SDL are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Solar Ventures”). The investment period with our institutional capital partner extends to July 15, 2023, for SDL, SCL and SPL.  
 Our External Manager provides loan origination, servicing, asset management and other management services to the Solar Ventures. Loans are typically underwritten to generate internal rates of return (“IRR”) ranging from 10% to 15%, before expenses, range in size from $2 million to over $50 million, and have durations of three months to five years. Through December 31, 2018, the Solar Ventures have made over 100 project-based loans that total $1.3 billion of debt commitments for the development of over 430 renewable energy project sites, which will generate over 2.7 gigawatts of renewable energy.
 On June 1, 2018, the Company became the sole owner of REL and consolidated this entity for reporting purposes at December 31, 2018. Our buyout of our prior investment partner’s interest in REL enabled us to increase the amount of equity we are able to deploy into renewable energy investments through the Solar Ventures, provided us with full decision-making control over REL and eliminated the preferred return that was payable to our prior investment partner. Subsequent to the buyout of our prior investment partner, the Solar Ventures have been able to increase loan originations, and thus reduce the amount of uninvested equity within the ventures, resulting in an increase in returns to the Company. 
 Investment Carrying Value
 The carrying value of MMA’s equity investment in the Solar Ventures was $126.3 million and $97.0 million at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. The $29.3 million year-over-year increase in the carrying value of such investment was comprised of the following: (i) $55.9 million of capital contributions; (ii) $33.5 million of distributions received and (iii) $6.9 million of equity in income earned during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 3, “Investments in Partnerships” for additional information. Investment Income
 The Company earned $6.9 million and $9.2 million of equity in income from the Solar Ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in equity in income from the Solar Ventures was primarily the result of three factors: (i) the Company sold its loan origination, servicing and management components of its Energy Capital business as part of the Disposition and, as a result, the Company did not earn management fees in 2018 (during 2017 $1.1 million of management fees were classified as equity in income from the Solar Ventures for reporting purposes); (ii) the preferred return earned by the Company’s former investment partner in REL increased during the five months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in the amount of capital invested by the Company’s former investment partner and (iii) amortization of the purchase premium paid by the Company on June 1, 2018 to buyout our former investment partner’s interest in REL, which is reported as a reduction to equity in income earned by the Company. The impact of the aforementioned factors that caused a reduction in the total amount of equity in income earned by the Company from the Solar Ventures was partially offset by a year-over-year increase in equity in income from SDL that was primarily driven by an increase in the Company’s allocable share of the venture’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 3, “Investments in Partnerships” for additional information on the Company’s equity investments.
 Financial Position of the Solar Ventures    Table 1 provides information about the carrying amount of total assets, other liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the Solar Ventures at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

(1) | On June 1, 2018, the Company bought out its investment partner in REL and consolidated such entity for reporting purposes in all subsequent reporting periods in 2018. As a result, the Company’s equity investment in REL was eliminated for reporting purposes and equity in income associated with REL’s equity investment in SCL and SPL were reported in the Company’s financial statements.

      Lending Activities of the Solar Ventures
 At December 31, 2018, the loans that were funded through the Solar Ventures had an aggregate unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of $250.8 million, a weighted-average remaining maturity of seven months and a weighted-average coupon of 9.2%. These loans generated origination fees that ranged from 1.0% to 2.0% on committed capital and had fixed-rate coupons that ranged from 7.0% to 13.8%.
 As of December 31, 2018, 80 of the Solar Ventures’ project loans, totaling $929.6 million of commitments, had been repaid. These loans were all paid in full, resulting in a weighted-average IRR (“WAIRR”) of 15.8%, which was on average higher than originally underwritten. WAIRR was measured as the total return in dollars of all repaid loans divided by the total commitment amount associated with such loans, where (i) the total return for each repaid loan was calculated as the product of each loan’s IRR and its commitment amount and (ii) IRR for each repaid loan was established by solving for a discount rate that made the net present value of all loan cash flows equal zero. WAIRR is higher than the net return on the Company's investments in the Solar Ventures because it is a measure of gross returns earned by the Solar Ventures on repaid loans and does not include the effects of: (i) operating expenses of the Solar Ventures; (ii) the preferred return earned by the Company’s former investment partner in REL; (iii) the amortization of the purchase premium paid by the Company to buyout our former investment partner’s interest in REL and (iv) the opportunity cost of idle capital. 
 OA&L Portfolio
 In our OA&L portfolio, we manage the Company’s cash, investment in bonds and related financing, loan receivables, real estate-related investments, subordinated debt and other assets and liabilities of the Company. An overview of the primary assets and liabilities within this portfolio follows.
 Cash
 As of December 31, 2018, we had $28.2 million of unrestricted cash and $5.6 million of restricted cash that was primarily pledged as collateral in connection with financial risk management and financing agreements. Investments in Bonds and Related Financing
 Our investments in bonds finance affordable housing and infrastructure in the U.S. and are fixed rate and unrated. Our bonds are also tax-exempt and primarily collateralized by affordable multifamily rental properties. Substantially all of the rental units in these multifamily properties, some of which may be subsidized by the government, have tenant income and rent restrictions.
 The Company also has one municipal bond that finances the development of infrastructure (“Infrastructure Bond”) for a mixed-use town center development and is secured by incremental tax revenues generated from the development.

 The Company has financed a portion of its investments in bonds through total return swap (“TRS”) agreements. These financing arrangements enable the Company to retain the economic risks and rewards of the fixed rate bonds that are referenced in such agreements and generally require the Company to pay a variable rate of interest that resets on a weekly basis. The Company also has executed TRS agreements to synthetically acquire the total return of multifamily bonds that it does not own. The Company has hedged a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its TRS agreements and other sources of variable interest rate exposure using various interest rate risk management agreements.
 Table 2 provides key metrics related to all bonds in which we have an economic interest, including bonds in which we acquired an economic interest through TRS agreements (such bonds and TRS agreements are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Bond-Related Investments”). See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 6, “Debt,” and Note 7, “Derivative Instruments” for more information about how TRS and interest rate risk management agreements are reported in the Company’s financial statements.

(3) | On October 30, 2018, the Company agreed to restructure its two infrastructure bond investments into a single tax-exempt bond with a UPB of $27.2 million, a coupon of 6.30% and a contractual term of 30.1 years.

Our Bond-Related Investments also includes four bonds that are accounted for as a secured borrowing with a combined UPB and fair value of $38.7 million and $40.9 million, respectively, of which three of such bonds were financed with TRS agreements that had a combined notional amount of $31.7 million.

If the Company had included the effects of subordinated cash flow bonds in the determination of these amounts, the weighted-average coupon for total multifamily tax-exempt bonds and for all Bond-Related Investments would have been 6.61% and 6.54%, respectively, at December 31, 2018, and the weighted-average pay rate for total multifamily tax-exempt bonds and for all Bond-Related Investments would have been 5.73% and 5.87%, respectively, at December 31, 2018.

(8) | For comparative purposes, at September 30, 2018, our Bond-Related Investments were comprised of 27 bonds, which included 25 multifamily tax-exempt bonds that were collateralized by 20 affordable multifamily rental properties. The fair value of our Bond-Related Investments as a percentage of its UPB increased from 103.7% at September 30, 2018 to 106.0% at December 31, 2018, while the weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of our Bond-Related Investments was 1.12x and 1.20x at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

 The fair value of our Bond-Related Investments as a percentage of its UPB increased from 102.5% at December 31, 2017, to 106.0% at December 31, 2018, while the weighted-average debt service coverage ratio associated with our Bond-Related Investments improved to 1.20x at December 31, 2018, from 1.10x at December 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase in these two metrics was primarily attributable to the Company’s Infrastructure Bond investment and a non-performing multifamily tax-exempt bond investment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company’s Infrastructure Bond investment was restructured, which increased its contractual maturity, the amount of contractual cash flows that are expected to be paid and its fair value (a decrease in the market yield of this investment also contributed to its increase in fair value). Additionally, through the restructuring, the community development district (“CDD”) in which the mixed-use development is located will assess owners of undeveloped land parcels an undeveloped land license fee that will supplement tax revenues that are generated from the mixed-use town center development, thereby increasing the amount of funds available to the CDD to make principal and interest payments to the Company on our Infrastructure Bond. Separately, the fair value of the Company’s non-performing multifamily tax-exempt bond investment increased in 2018 in consideration of third-party indications of value that were obtained in connection with the pending sale of such property. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 2, “Investments in Debt Securities” and Note 8, “Fair Value” for additional information.
 Between December 18, 2018 and December 20, 2018, the Company entered into a series of transactions that involved: (i) the termination of 15 TRS agreements that had a total notional amount of $102.6 million; (ii) the sale of one multifamily tax-exempt bond and one subordinate certificate interest in a multifamily tax-exempt bond with an aggregate UPB of $10.8 million; (iii) the termination of a pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement that had a notional amount of $65 million and (iv) the termination of a basis interest rate swap agreement that had a notional amount of $10.5 million. Additionally, on January 3, 2019, the Company entered into additional agreements with this same counterparty to sell one multifamily tax-exempt bond and one subordinate certificate interest in a multifamily tax-exempt bond with an aggregate UPB and fair value of $8.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively. These transactions were entered into for the purpose of both making more capital available to fund renewable energy lending investments and monetizing premiums on our Bond-Related Investments before they amortized, which would cause projected returns over that period to be lower than prospective investments in the Energy Capital portfolio. In the aggregate, these transactions provided the Company with total net cash proceeds of $22.7 million. The portion of such net proceeds that is attributable to the Company's TRS and other bond interests reflects the realization of a 4.8% premium above the UPB of such TRS and bond interests. The settlement of the transactions executed in December resulted in the reclassification of $16.8 million of fair value gains on bond investments into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income during the fourth quarter of 2018 while the settlement of the transactions executed in January will result in the reclassification of $3.6 million fair value gains on bond investments into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income during the first quarter of 2019.
 Hunt Note
 As consideration for the Disposition, Hunt agreed to pay the Company $57.0 million and to assume certain liabilities of the Company. The Company provided seller financing to Hunt through a $57.0 million note receivable from Hunt that had an initial term of seven years, is prepayable at any time and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum. On October 4, 2018, the Company’s note receivable from Hunt increased to $67.0 million as part of Hunt’s settlement under the MGM Agreements. The UPB on the note will amortize in 20 equal quarterly payments of $3.35 million beginning on March 31, 2020. Refer to “Interests in MGM” and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 13, “Related Party Transactions and Transactions with Affiliates” for more information. Real Estate-Related Investments
 When the Company conveyed its international asset and investment management business to Hunt, it retained an 11.85% ownership interest in the South Africa Workforce Housing Fund (“SAWHF”), along with related financing for that investment and a foreign currency hedge agreement for risk management purposes. SAWHF is a multi-investor fund managed by affiliates of International Housing Solutions S.à r.l. (“IHS”) that began operations in April 2008 and is currently in the process of exiting its investments. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in SAWHF was $8.8 million at December 31, 2018.
 At December 31, 2018, we owned one direct investment in real estate consisting of a land parcel. This undeveloped real estate is located just outside the city of Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia and had a carrying value of $3.8 million as of December 31, 2018.

 
  7

 

 At December 31, 2018, we were an equity partner in four real estate-related investments consisting of (i) an 80.0% ownership interest in a mixed-use town center development, whose incremental tax revenues secure our Infrastructure Bond and (ii) three limited partner interests in partnerships that owned affordable housing and in which our ownership interest ranged from 74.25% to 74.92%. The carrying value of these four investments was $19.9 million at December 31, 2018.
 Deferred Tax Assets
 Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) are recognized if we assess that it is more likely than not that tax benefits, including net operating losses (“NOLs”) and other tax attributes, will be realized prior to their expiration. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our DTAs was $124.5 million; however, these assets were fully reserved because management determined that, as of such reporting date, it was not more likely than not that the Company would realize its DTAs.   Debt Obligations
 The OA&L portfolio includes the Company’s asset related debt, subordinated debt, notes payable and other debt. The carrying value and weighted-average yield of these debt obligations was $149.2 million and 4.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Refer to Table 25, “Asset Related Debt and Other Debt” for more information. Interest Rate Risk Hedge Positions
 We use interest rate swaps and caps to hedge interest rate risk associated with debt obligations in this portfolio. The net fair value of these financial instruments was $4.5 million at December 31, 2018.
 Interests in MGM
 As consideration for the sale of our LIHTC business to MGM in 2014, the Company received an option to acquire the LIHTC business of MGM, which primarily manages LIHTC investments on behalf of third-party investors and for its own account. On January 8, 2018, as part of the Disposition transaction the Company executed a series of agreements to: (i) convert the MGM purchase option into a purchase and sale agreement that required the Company to complete the purchase of MGM subject to certain conditions precedent; (ii) acquire certain assets pertaining to a specific LIHTC property from affiliates of MGM and (iii) purchase a senior loan with a UPB of $9.0 million from an MGM affiliate that was secured by assets of MGM and bore interest at 11% payable quarterly.
 On October 4, 2018, Hunt exercised its option to take assignment of, and close under, the MGM Agreements, which resulted in the Company recognizing an increase in common shareholders’ equity of $14.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2018.
 In connection with the closing under the MGM Agreements, the Company executed a series of additional transactions completing the Company’s disposition of MGM and other LIHTC related assets. Those additional transactions included the acquisition by Hunt of (i) the Company’s $9.0 million held for sale loan for $9.4 million of cash that the Company had previously acquired from an affiliate of MGM and (ii) the Company’s remaining general partner interests in two nonconsolidated LIHTC funds. In addition, the Company acquired $10.0 million in Hunt notes from the MGM principals for $5.0 million in cash and $5.0 million in a Company note. This purchase increased the aggregate principal balance of the Company’s existing $57.0 million note from Hunt to $67.0 million. The Company’s $5.0 million note to the MGM principals bears interest at 5.0%, is payable quarterly in arrears and has a varying amortization schedule that fully amortizes the note by its maturity date of January 1, 2026.
 Carrying Values of the OA&L Portfolio
 Table 3 provides financial information about the carrying values associated with the Company’s OA&L portfolio reported within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. For presentation purposes, assets, liabilities and equity attributable to noncontrolling interest holders of CFVs and discontinued operations are excluded from the comparative discussion of our OA&L portfolio because (i) the Company generally had a minimal ownership interest in these consolidated entities and (ii) the Disposition resulted in the deconsolidation from the 

 
  8

 
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first quarter of 2018 of all guaranteed LIHTC funds and derecognition of nearly all other CFVs, including previously consolidated property partnerships, that were recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017. Additionally, assets and liabilities that were attributable to businesses or assets that were conveyed by the Company in the Disposition were reclassified for all reporting periods and are presented as discontinued operations. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 15, “Discontinued Operations” and Note 16, “Consolidated Funds and Ventures,” for more information about CFVs and the Company’s reported discontinued operations. Furthermore, given the changes to the Company’s business model noted within Part I, Item 1. “Business,” we now operate as a single reporting segment. As such, certain corporate assets and liabilities of the Company (deferred compensation, accounts payable and accrued expenses, prepaid expenses and state tax receivable) have been excluded from our comparative discussion of our OA&L portfolio because such items have not been allocated to the OA&L portfolio and will only be reported on a consolidated basis.

 Sources of Comprehensive Income from the OA&L Portfolio
     Table 4 provides financial information about sources of comprehensive income associated with the Company’s OA&L portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Consistent with the presentation of Table 3, “Balance Sheet Summary of the OA&L portfolio,” for presentation purposes, income (loss) that was attributable to noncontrolling interest holders of CFVs, discontinued operations and operating expenses (salaries and benefits, external management fees and reimbursable expenses, general and administrative, professional fees and tax related expenses) that were not directly attributable to the Other Assets and Liabilities portfolio have been excluded from our comparative discussion of our results of operations. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 15, “Discontinued Operations” and Note 16, “Consolidated Funds and Ventures,” for more information about CFVs and the Company’s reported discontinued operations.

 Our External Manager
 In conjunction with the Disposition, we entered into a management agreement with the External Manager (the “Management Agreement”) that took effect on January 8, 2018. At the time of the Disposition, all employees of the Company were hired by the External Manager. In consideration for the management services being provided by the External Manager, the Company pays the External Manager a base management fee, which is payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to (i) 0.50% of the Company’s first $500 million of common shareholders’ equity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) on a fully diluted basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of (a) the value of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, and (b) any gains or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests (“GAAP Common Shareholders’ Equity”); and (ii) 0.25% of the Company’s GAAP Common Shareholders’ Equity in excess of $500 million. Additionally, the Company agreed to pay the External Manager an annual incentive fee equal to 20% of the total annual return of diluted common shareholders’ equity per share in excess of 7%. The Company also agreed to reimburse the External Manager for certain allocable overhead costs including an allocable share of the costs of (i) noninvestment personnel of the External Manager and an affiliate thereof who spend all or a portion of their time managing the Company’s operations and reporting as a public company (based on their time spent on such matters) and (ii) the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) based on the percentage of their time spent managing the Company. Reimbursement of compensation-related expenses is, however, subject to an annual cap of $2.5 million through 2019 and $3.5 million thereafter, until the Company’s GAAP common shareholders’ equity exceeds $500 million. 
 The current term of the Management Agreement extends to December 31, 2022 and automatically renews thereafter for additional two-year terms. Either of the Company or the External Manager may, upon written notice, decline to renew or terminate the Management Agreement without cause, effective at the end of the initial term or any renewal term. If the Company declines to renew or terminates the Management Agreement without cause or the External Manager terminates for cause, the Company is required to pay a termination fee to the External Manager equal to three times the sum of the average annual base and incentive management fees, plus one times the sum of the average Energy Capital business expense reimbursements and the employee cost reimbursement expense, in each case, during the prior two-year period. The Company may also terminate the Management Agreement for cause, including in the event of a payment default under the Hunt note which causes the Hunt note to become immediately due and payable. No termination fee is payable upon a termination by the Company for cause or upon a termination by the Manager without cause.
 Competition
 In our Energy Capital portfolio, we face competition from banks and other renewable energy lenders related to new investments.  
 In our OA&L portfolio, the properties that collateralize our debt and equity investments compete against other companies and properties that seek similar tenants and offer similar services as our real estate-related investments.
 While we have historically been able to compete effectively as a result of our service, reputation, access to investor capital and longstanding relationships with developers, many of our competitors benefit from substantial economies of scale in their business and have other competitive advantages.
