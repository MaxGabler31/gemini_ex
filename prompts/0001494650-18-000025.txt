ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our Company
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for patients treated by ear, nose and throat, or ENT, and allergy specialists. Our lead product, XHANCETM (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, 93 mcg, is a therapeutic utilizing our proprietary Optinose Exhalation Delivery System, or EDS, that delivers a topically-acting and potent anti-inflammatory corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and, if approved, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease that is currently treated using therapies, such as intranasal steroids, or INS, that have significant limitations. We believe XHANCE has a differentiated clinical profile with the potential to become part of the standard of care for this disease because it is able to deliver medication to the primary site of inflammation high and deep in the nasal passages in regions not adequately reached by current INS. We also believe that payors will respond favorably to XHANCE's clinical, cost, and quality-of-care profile, as compared to current and potential future costly drug therapy and surgical treatment options.
On September 18, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our new drug application, or NDA, for XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older. Based upon our research of over 300 launches between 2010 and 2016, we believe the evidence suggests that the success of a launch is highly dependent upon four critical factors: level of unmet need that exists within the market, level of clinical differentiation of a brand, market access and brand awareness. Therefore, rather than rushing our product to the market immediately following approval, our Company employed a different, purposeful launch model that would enable our commercial team to build market access for XHANCE and achieve critical levels of customer awareness to facilitate adoption upon making XHANCE available in the market.
Since the FDA approved of our NDA for XHANCE, we have been focused on executing our integrated launch plan with the objective of making XHANCE widely available through retail pharmacies in the second quarter of 2018; we now believe XHANCE will be available in retail pharmacies in early April 2018. The key strategies in our integrated launch plan include: (i) build a robust supply chain network and quality management system, (ii) drive awareness and appreciation of the clinical differentiation of XHANCE, (iii) design and deploy our customer facing model, (iv) engage commercial payors with the objective of securing tier 3 coverage, and (v) develop our internal capabilities (Finance, HR, IT, Data Analytics and Compliance) to support a commercial stage company. We have made progress in each of these key strategic areas:

• | Commercial Supply Chain. We have entered into commercial supply agreements with our key suppliers, spent significant time with our suppliers to oversee product production and quality management, and manufactured our initial commercial supply of XHANCE. We have contracted with a third-party logistics partner and are in the process of finalizing agreements with our distribution partners. 


• | Brand Awareness. We have executed a broad, multi-channel awareness campaign leveraging digital, non- personal promotion and journal advertising and have already reached over 10,000 ENT physicians and allergists with disease state and branded messages. In November 2017, we launched a nurse educator team of approximately 85 nurse professionals who have since called on approximately 5,000 ENT physicians and allergists and delivered over 10,000 presentations. The focus of their interactions with healthcare professionals include: (i) introducing Optinose and highlighting the unmet medical need and limitations of current treatments, (ii) increasing awareness about XHANCE along with differentiating the Optinose EDS, and (iii) familiarizing healthcare professionals with the proper administration of XHANCE. Initial reaction to core brand messages among target physicians has been positive. 


• | Customer Model. We have defined a sales force footprint of approximately 120 territories targeting approximately 14,000 ENT physicians, allergists and “specialty like” primary care physicians and are deploying a hybrid sales model that combines an internal sales leadership team with a fully dedicated contract sales force to call on our target customer universe. We have prioritized approximately 80 territories within our sales force footprint to deploy at launch based upon an expectation that we will achieve an estimated 65% commercial market access within each of those territories during launch. Most of the initial 

3

80 territory managers have completed training and are already engaging approximately 8,000 ENTs, allergists and primary care physician targets to promote XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps. Additionally, in March 2018, we introduced the XHANCE Xperience program to offer select physicians and their patients an opportunity to gain initial experience with XHANCE. Physicians can enroll a limited number of eligible patients in this program. Patients will receive up to two XHANCE prescriptions at no cost to them ($0 co-pay), and physicians will receive an opportunity for feedback on patient experience. We believe the positive experience that physicians and patients have with XHANCE in this program will help drive demand for XHANCE during the retail launch, starting in early April 2018.

• | Market Access. We have been engaging payors with the goal of securing tier 3 commercial coverage, primarily with a single step edit and no prior authorization. We have engaged with approximately 40 plans representing approximately 85% of commercial lives. In meeting with potential payors, we have shared what we believe is our compelling economic value proposition. Our analyses show that XHANCE will have a comparatively low pharmacy budget impact and our clinical trial data suggest that XHANCE may produce an offsetting benefit by helping reduce the rate of surgery with its related costs. For an insurance plan, this could represent a potential overall cost reduction for the population of patients with nasal polyps, as the overall cost of XHANCE could be less than the offsetting costs related to the reduction in surgeries. During clinical studies, XHANCE was also associated with an improvement in reported work productivity in treated patients, which should be valued by employers and patients. Further, we believe the cost of XHANCE to insurance plans will likely be significantly less than the projected costs of monoclonal antibodies that are currently in development for the treatment of nasal polyps. We expect to achieve approximately 65% coverage of commercial lives during the retail launch of XHANCE, and will seek to increase the number of covered lives during the first year. We have contracted with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding certain government covered lives. Further, we plan to introduce a co-pay assistance program and other patient affordability programs to appropriately support patient access to XHANCE. 


• | Infrastructure. We continue to develop our internal capabilities and grew from 21 employees as of January 1, 2017 to 82 employees as of March 1, 2018 to support a commercial stage company. We have implemented an enterprise resource planning system to expand our operational and commercial finance capabilities. We have implemented a robust healthcare compliance program to guide our staff’s and our partners' compliance with rules and regulations regarding pharmaceutical sales. In managing our growth, we have remained focused on fostering our One Mission culture. 

In additional to XHANCE’s existing indication for nasal polyps, we plan to initiate additional clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2018 to seek a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis in order to broaden our market opportunity. XHANCE is the second commercial product that we have developed utilizing an Optinose EDS. Our first commercial product, indicated for the acute treatment of migraines in adults, was licensed in 2013 to Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Avanir, and was approved by the FDA in January 2016.
The Unmet Need
Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease characterized by chronic inflammation affecting tissues high and deep in the nasal passages, including the area where the openings from the sinuses normally ventilate and drain. This disease significantly impacts the quality of life and daily functioning of an estimated 30 million adults in the United States. The U.S. healthcare system spends approximately $60 billion annually in direct costs treating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and its associated symptoms, including an estimated $5 billion on sinus surgeries. In the United States, physicians perform over 500,000 sinus surgeries each year, and we estimate that over seven million adults have undergone sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps.
In medical literature and medical practice, chronic rhinosinusitis is commonly divided into two subgroups: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis patients with and without nasal polyps suffer from chronic inflammation of the lining of the deep nasal passages and sinuses. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps also develop non-cancerous polyps on these chronically inflamed surfaces, typically originating in the deep crevices or sinus cavities on both sides of the nose. We estimate that up to 10 million adults in the United States have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Both subgroups of chronic rhinosinusitis share the same four defining diagnostic symptoms: nasal congestion/obstruction; facial pain and pressure; purulent runny nose and postnasal drip; and loss of sense of smell and taste. Additional symptoms may include headaches, chronic sleep problems, fatigue, frequent episodes of acute 
4

rhinosinusitis and mood disorders. There is evidence suggesting that the harm to a sufferer's quality of life from chronic rhinosinusitis, as measured in multiple domains, such as bodily pain, social functioning and mental health, is comparable to or worse than other serious diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and angina. As a result, many patients eventually seek surgery for symptom relief.
Although the term chronic rhinosinusitis is often used in medical literature and medical practice, the FDA does not recognize chronic rhinosinusitis as a single indication for drug development purposes. Instead, the FDA recognizes chronic sinusitis, defined as inflammation of the sinuses with a duration longer than eight weeks, and nasal polyps, defined as non-cancerous polyps on the inflamed tissue of the nasal passages and sinuses, as separate indications for drug development purposes. For purposes of this 10-K, we use the terms chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps when referring to FDA treatment indications and our clinical trials, and use the term chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps when referring to disease and economic data reported in the medical literature, medical practice and our estimates of XHANCE's market opportunity.
Current Treatment Limitations
Multiple current clinical practice guidelines specify the use of INS early in the treatment algorithm for chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. Steroids are generally pharmacologically effective at treating inflammation. However, conventional INS, including nasal sprays and nasal aerosols, are topically-acting and unable to effectively and consistently place the steroids onto the primary site of inflammation and nasal polyp origin, high and deep in the nasal passages. These products deposit a majority of the drug in the front of the nose or on the floor of the nasal passages, reducing their effectiveness and leaving many patients without sufficient symptomatic relief. These recognized limitations cause some physicians to seek out alternative treatment regimens such as high-volume steroid nasal rinses. This approach, however, has not been well studied, is difficult to administer, can be costly and may risk systemic side effects. Physicians may also prescribe oral steroids on an episodic basis to patients who have not received sufficient symptomatic relief from INS. Oral steroids, which are often effective in reducing inflammation and nasal polyps, offer only temporary benefit and are limited by the risk of significant systemic side effects associated with both short- and long-term use.
In cases where patients remain symptomatic despite medical management, physicians often recommend various forms of sinus surgery to help restore normal sinus ventilation or drainage. The effectiveness of sinus surgery can vary significantly and many patients experience persistent or recurrent symptoms and surgery may not address the underlying cause of inflammation. In patients with nasal polyps, regrowth of the nasal polyps has been reported in as high as 60% of cases within four years. In addition, it has been reported that 80% of patients who had surgery within the past two years continued to have symptoms. Because sinus surgery is often not curative and may not address the underlying cause of the inflammation, many patients continue to receive short- and long-term courses of INS after surgery.
Our Solution
XHANCE combines an Optinose EDS with a liquid formulation of fluticasone propionate, a well-characterized, second-generation corticosteroid. XHANCE is designed to deliver medication into the high and deep regions of the nasal passages where both nasal polyps and inflamed and swollen membranes can obstruct normal sinus ventilation and drainage. In multiple studies utilizing advanced imaging, an Optinose EDS produced a differentiated pattern of drug delivery in healthy subjects with significant drug deposited in the high and deep regions of the nasal passages, areas not well accessed by conventional INS delivery mechanisms. We believe XHANCE has the potential to become part of the standard of care for the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis before they progress to more costly treatment alternatives. We also believe that the current treatment practice of postoperative INS use could support XHANCE's adoption as a maintenance therapy to improve outcomes following sinus surgery.
We conducted five clinical trials evaluating over 1,500 adult patients, including two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials in adults with nasal polyps and two supportive open-label Phase 3 clinical trials in adults with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. In both Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, patients treated with XHANCE experienced statistically significant reductions of both nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms and total polyp grade, which were the co-primary endpoints. Treatment benefits were also observed in all four defining symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as in polyp elimination, quality of life measures, need for sinus surgery and patient global impression of change. In addition, the magnitude of improvement for patients treated by XHANCE in our Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, as measured by the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22, a validated clinical outcome assessment, was comparable to the reported benefits in third-party studies of endoscopic sinus surgery, or ESS, and balloon sinus dilation. XHANCE had an adverse event profile generally comparable to the profile reported in similarly designed studies with conventional INS. In our supportive 
5

open-label Phase 3 clinical trials, which evaluated approximately 900 patients with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with and without nasal polyps for a period of up to one year, XHANCE was generally well tolerated and produced results on efficacy endpoints similar to those observed in our Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials. In these supportive trials, we observed comparable symptom improvements in patients with and without nasal polyps and continuing incremental polyp reduction and symptom improvement through 12 months.
We believe XHANCE will offer a cost-effective treatment solution to payors who are increasingly being asked to pay for multiple high-cost therapies for a variety of diseases priced at tens of thousands of dollars per year. We priced XHANCE comparably to the only other branded INS that is currently approved to treat nasal polyps, but at a price higher than generic INS products. We expect XHANCE to be adopted by physicians at a natural point in the care pathway for use in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps before they progress to costly surgical interventions or biologic monoclonal antibodies in development for nasal polyps. Sinus surgery costs between $8,500 and $16,000 per procedure, and we expect that biologic monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of nasal polyps will cost approximately $35,000 per year based on the doses being studied in nasal polyps and the current costs per dose in other indications. We believe XHANCE will offer a cost-effective clinical benefit to payors that will reduce the perceived need for multiple step-edits and prior authorizations, which we believe will increase the likelihood of successful commercial adoption of XHANCE.
U.S. Market Opportunity
Our initial target market for XHANCE will consist of ENT physicians, allergists and primary care physicians in the United States that most frequently prescribe INS. This group of approximately 5,000 primary care physicians, which we refer to as high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians, account for approximately 25% of all INS prescriptions written by primary care physicians. We refer to these ENT physicians, allergists and high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians collectively as the specialty segment of our target market. We believe the approximately 15,000 physicians in this specialty segment together treat an estimated 3.5 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We believe the total annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in this specialty segment is over $3.4 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. If we are able to obtain approval for the follow-on indication of chronic sinusitis, we intend to broaden our commercialization efforts to target additional primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We refer to these additional primary care physicians as the primary care segment of our target market. We believe the total additional annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in this primary care segment is over $6.0 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Therefore, we estimate the total annual U.S. market opportunity for the combined specialty and primary care segments is over $9.5 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Intellectual Property and Barriers to Entry
XHANCE benefits from substantial intellectual property and other technical barriers to entry, including regulatory and drug delivery complexities. Our XHANCE U.S. patent portfolio consists of 9 issued device and method of use patents expiring through 2030, three issued design patents expiring through 2030 and 12 patent applications that, if granted, would expire through 2034. The 9 issued device and method of use patents are published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. 
We believe the unique features of an Optinose EDS, as well as its delivery of a topically-acting drug, will present generic and 505(b)(2) NDA competitors of XHANCE with human factors engineering challenges specific to drug-device combination products and chemistry, manufacturing and controls challenges unique to suspension and respiratory products. We also believe that any future substitutable generic competitors would be required to conduct, among other things, non-inferiority clinical trials demonstrating equivalent efficacy and safety outcomes to establish clinical bioequivalence to XHANCE. We believe these clinical trials would require a significant amount of time and capital investment and present clinical development uncertainties.
Our Management Team
We are led by a management team with an average of over 20 years of experience developing and commercializing products at large, multinational pharmaceutical and medical device companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi-Aventis, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Takeda and Novartis. Our management team's experience is complemented by its expertise at growing emerging healthcare companies, such as Cephalon, NuPathe and Take Care Health System. Our team previously developed our first product using an exhalation delivery system, Onzetra Xsail. We 
6

believe the experience of our management team and our broad network of relationships with leaders within the industry and the medical community provide us with insight into product development and identification of product opportunities that benefit patients and physicians in the ENT and allergy specialty segments.
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing proprietary products that become a part of the standard of care for diseases in the ENT and allergy segments. We also plan to expand the use of the Optinose EDS into additional indications with significant unmet needs, including potential nose-to-brain drug delivery for central nervous system disorders. The key elements of our strategy are to:

▪ | Commercialize XHANCE in the ENT and allergy specialty segments in the United States. We plan to deploy an efficient, go-to-market commercialization model and have completed the build out of our commercial team and organization. Our fully dedicated specialty sales force of approximately 80 territory managers completed training and initiated promotion of XHANCE in early March 2018 to a defined prescriber base of approximately 6,000 ENT and allergy specialists, as well as approximately 2,000 high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians. Because we expect to secure broader market access over the next 12 to 18 months, we intend to increase the size of our sales force to approximately 120 territory managers based upon an expanded target audience of approximately 14,000 specialists or specialty-like primary care physicians. Additionally, we expect to target an additional approximately 1,000 physicians through digital and non-personal promotion in areas where we do not have territory managers. We believe these approximately 15,000 physicians treat an estimated 3.5 million chronic rhinosinusitis patients, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 


▪ | Pursue pipeline development of XHANCE for chronic sinusitis to broaden our market opportunity. We plan to seek a follow-on indication for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. We believe XHANCE would be the first drug therapy product approved for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. In the future, as appropriate, we plan to broaden our marketing to additional primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million patients in the U.S. with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In addition, at some point in the future, we intend to consider directing promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million adult chronic rhinosinusitis sufferers who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion.


▪ | Develop a pipeline of additional products focused on the ENT and allergy specialty segments. We are evaluating the use of the Optinose EDS to deliver other drugs or drug combinations, including antibiotics, anticholinergics, antihistamines, mucolytics, leukotriene inhibitors and other medication classes, to treat diseases primarily managed by ENT and allergy specialists. We also intend to explore complementary drug, diagnostic or device technologies or products to make effective use of our commercial infrastructure. We also plan to evaluate strategic licensing, acquisition, development and commercial partnerships that could increase our commercial efficiencies. 


▪ | Explore business development activities for Optinose EDS outside of the ENT and allergy segments. We are exploring the possibility of using an Optinose EDS to support development of central nervous system treatments, particularly those enabled by nose-to-brain drug delivery. We are in the early stages of clinical development of OPN-300, which combines an Optinose EDS with oxytocin for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. We are in preclinical development of OPN-021, which combines an Optinose EDS with orexin-A, for the treatment of narcolepsy or symptoms of other diseases potentially amenable to the same pharmacologic activity, such as Parkinson's disease. We intend to evaluate business development activities to capture value through the continued development of these assets. 


▪ | Expand XHANCE into international markets. We have begun an initial assessment of the development and commercialization of XHANCE for markets outside the United States and plan to conduct further strategic evaluation of such markets now that XHANCE has been approved in the United States. We also intend to explore strategic collaboration opportunities in Europe and the rest of the world in order to maximize the commercial potential and the availability of XHANCE to patients.

Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Market Opportunity
Chronic Rhinosinusitis
Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease significantly impacting patients' quality of life and daily functioning. Chronic rhinosinusitis, unlike allergic rhinitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation affecting tissues high and deep in the nasal passages, including the area where the openings from the sinuses normally ventilate and drain, causing symptoms that persist for a period of 8 to 12 weeks or longer. Chronic rhinosinusitis patients typically suffer from these symptoms four to six months a year, with symptoms often persisting for many years.
In medical literature and medical practice, chronic rhinosinusitis is commonly divided into two subgroups: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis patients with and without nasal polyps suffer from chronic inflammation of the lining of the deep nasal passages and sinuses. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps also develop non-cancerous polyps on these chronically inflamed surfaces, typically originating in the deep crevices or sinus cavities on both sides of the nose. We estimate that up to 10 million adults in the United States have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Both subgroups of chronic rhinosinusitis share the same four defining diagnostic symptoms: nasal congestion/obstruction; facial pain and pressure; purulent runny nose, and postnasal drip; and loss of sense of smell and taste. Additional symptoms may include headaches, chronic sleep problems, fatigue, frequent episodes of acute rhinosinusitis and mood disorders. There is evidence suggesting that the harm to a sufferer's quality of life from chronic rhinosinusitis, as measured in multiple domains, such as bodily pain, social functioning and mental health, is comparable to or worse than other serious diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and angina. As a result, many patients eventually seek surgery for symptom relief.
Although the term chronic rhinosinusitis is often used in medical literature and medical practice, the FDA does not recognize chronic rhinosinusitis as a single indication for drug development purposes. Instead, the FDA recognizes chronic sinusitis, defined as inflammation of the sinuses with a duration longer than eight weeks, and nasal polyps defined as non-cancerous polyps on the inflamed tissue of the nasal passages and sinuses, as separate indications for drug development purposes.
The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery estimates that approximately 30 million adults in the United States have chronic rhinosinusitis, and it is estimated that up to 10 million adults have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis imposes a significant healthcare burden on insurers and employers. The U.S. healthcare system spends approximately $60 billion annually in direct costs treating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and its associated symptoms, including an estimated $5 billion on sinus surgeries. In the United States, physicians perform over 500,000 sinus surgeries each year, and we estimate that over seven million adults have undergone sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis has been reported to account for an aggregate of 73 million restricted activity days per year. Additionally, people with chronic rhinosinusitis have been reported to be absent from work because of this disease 6.5% of the time and to suffer a 38% loss of productivity.
U.S. Market Opportunity
We estimate that approximately 9.75 million chronic rhinosinusitis patients are currently being treated in physician offices in the United States. We derived this estimate from a large patient claims database that reflects actual treatment patterns of chronic rhinosinusitis over a two-year period from 2010 to 2012. We also estimate that approximately 10,000 ENT and allergy specialists, as well as approximately 5,000 high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians, treat approximately 36% of all chronic rhinosinusitis patients in the United States, or approximately 3.5 million patients, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In accordance with multiple published clinical practice guidelines, physicians typically medically manage chronic rhinosinusitis patients by prescribing INS despite the fact that there are no FDA-approved products for the treatment of chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps. We initially intend to target approximately 15,000 physicians in the specialty segment. If we obtain the follow-on indication for chronic sinusitis, we intend to broaden our marketing outreach to additional primary care physicians that treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We may also direct promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million chronic rhinosinusitis sufferers who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion.

Based on internal estimates, we believe the total annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in the specialty segment is over $3.4 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Based on these same estimates, we believe the total additional annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in the primary care segment is over $6.0 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Therefore, we estimate the total annual U.S. market opportunity for the combined specialty and primary care segments is over $9.5 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Treatment Landscape
The treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps typically begins with medical management. In cases where patients remain symptomatic despite medical management, physicians often recommend various forms of sinus surgery to help restore normal sinus ventilation and drainage. The following is a brief description of the current and potential future treatment landscape for chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps:
Current Therapies

▪ | Intranasal Steroids. Multiple published clinical practice guidelines generally recommend topically-acting INS as the first line of prescription therapy for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without polyps. As a result, physicians typically prescribe INS nasal sprays or nasal aerosols despite the fact that there are no FDA-approved products for the treatment of chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps. Therefore, the majority of chronic rhinosinusitis sufferers being treated have tried INS. We estimate that physicians in the United States prescribe approximately 17 million INS prescriptions each year for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, which includes, among other INS products, a generic fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Nasonex, or mometasone furoate nasal spray, is currently the only other branded INS approved by the FDA for the treatment of nasal polyps. A generic version of Nasonex, mometasone furoate monohydrate, was approved by the FDA for, among other indications, the treatment of nasal polyps and launched in 2016. Physicians not only prescribe INS as a standalone therapy, but also typically prescribe INS following sinus surgery as some third-party clinical trials suggest that INS treatment can improve symptoms and delay symptom recurrence. 


▪ | Oral steroids. Physicians may prescribe oral steroids on an episodic basis to patients who have not received sufficient symptomatic relief from INS. Oral steroids are often effective at treating the underlying inflammation associated with the disease and reducing postoperative scarring, but the benefit is temporary. As inflammation returns, many patients resume INS therapy. 


▪ | Other medical management. Physicians commonly employ a variety of other non-surgical treatments in the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis, including nasal saline rinses, multi-week courses of antibiotics, leukotriene antagonists, decongestants, aspirin desensitization and antifungals. The recognized limitations of drug deposition with current INS cause some physicians to seek out alternative treatment regimens, such as high doses of locally compounded liquid budesonide in high-volume nasal rinses. Chronic rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the United States, comprised of approximately 37 million prescriptions per year. 


▪ | Sinus surgery and other procedures. Physicians generally recommend surgical treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps only after patients fail medical management. The primary surgical alternative is ESS, which attempts to open the sinus drainage pathways while preserving as much bone and sinus tissue lining as possible. The physician typically uses rigid steel instruments and powered cutting tools to remove inflamed tissue, including any nasal polyps, and underlying bone to create a larger passage through the nasal anatomy to the sinuses. At the conclusion of the procedure, patients often have their nasal passages packed with a material that acts as a spacer to prevent surgical adhesions and control bleeding. Patients typically require one or more follow-up debridement treatments in which the physician may remove more tissue, crusting, scabs or scar tissue at the area of surgery in order to keep the sinus drainage pathway open and promote proper healing. 

Several companies have developed less invasive technologies for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis since the introduction of ESS, such as balloon sinus dilation devices and steroid-releasing sinus implants. Balloon sinus dilation employs a high pressure inflated balloon to open blocked sinus pathways to increase ventilation and mucus drainage. Steroid-releasing sinus implants are used to hold open the surgically enlarged sinus, while releasing a steroid over a period of time in order to reduce postoperative sinus inflammation and scarring.

Potential Future Therapies
Several biologic monoclonal antibodies, some of which are already approved for other indications, are being developed for the treatment of nasal polyps, and are believed to inhibit specific pathways of inflammation present in nasal polyps. These biologic monoclonal antibodies include omalizumab, reslizumab, mepolizumab and dupilumab.
Limitations of Therapies
The current and potential future therapies to treat patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps have a number of limitations, including:

▪ | Limited efficacy of INS treatments using traditional nasal sprays and nasal aerosols. Although steroids are generally pharmacologically effective, conventional INS, including nasal sprays and nasal aerosols, are unable to effectively and consistently place the steroids onto the primary site of inflammation and nasal polyp origin, high and deep in the nasal passages. These products deposit a majority of the drug in the front of the nose or on the floor of the nasal passages, reducing their effectiveness and leaving many patients without sufficient symptomatic relief. 


▪ | Short-term benefits of oral steroids outweighed by significant side effects. Oral steroids offer only temporary benefit and are limited by the risk of significant systemic side effects associated with both short- and long-term use. These side effects include, among others, weight gain; increased risk of infections; loss of bone mineral density; death of bone tissue; cataract formation; glaucoma; adrenal suppression; and psychiatric complications, including mania, depression, and psychosis. 


▪ | Varying degrees of efficacy with other medical management. Other non-surgical treatments have varying degrees of supporting data and efficacy. In addition, high-volume steroid nasal rinses are difficult to administer, can be costly, may risk systemic side effects due to the absorption of the steroid into the body, can be associated with fluid draining from the nose after the procedure and are difficult for patients to comply with over prolonged courses of outpatient therapy. 


▪ | Sinus surgery and other procedures are costly and may not be a complete solution. The effectiveness of sinus surgery varies significantly and many patients experience persistent or recurrent symptoms. Reports have shown that nasal polyp regrowth following surgery occurs in as high as 60% of cases within four years. In addition, it has been reported that 80% of patients who had surgery within the past two years continued to have symptoms. Because sinus surgery is often not curative and may not address the underlying cause of the inflammation, many patients receive short- and long-term courses of INS after surgery and approximately 20% of patients elect surgical revisions. Postoperative scarring and persistent inflammation are common and can compromise symptom outcomes and also negatively impact the ability of the sinuses to heal. Sinus surgery is also a costly procedure, with estimated costs ranging from $8,500 to $16,000 per procedure. While balloon sinus dilation has the ability to open sinuses in a less invasive manner, it also may not address the underlying cause of the inflammation associated with chronic rhinosinusitis and is costly. Similarly, steroid-releasing sinus implants have limited duration of anti-inflammatory effect, are costly and face reimbursement challenges. 


▪ | Potential future biologic monoclonal antibodies treatment may be costly, difficult to administer or have negative side effects. The risks and benefits associated with the use of biologic monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of nasal polyps are not yet fully established. We expect the use of biologic monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of nasal polyps to be costly, with estimated costs of approximately $35,000 per year based on the doses being studied in nasal polyps and the current costs per dose in other indications. These drugs also require subcutaneous injections or intravenous administration that require frequent physician office visits. We believe the systemic nature of these treatments, which target components of the immune response, may result in more adverse side effects than treatments with topically-acting steroids.

Our Solution
XHANCE
XHANCE combines an Optinose EDS with a liquid formulation of fluticasone propionate, a potent, well-characterized, second-generation anti-inflammatory corticosteroid for the treatment of serious nasal diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as chronic rhinosinusitis. XHANCE is designed to deliver fluticasone propionate into the high and deep regions of the nasal passages where nasal polyps or inflamed and swollen 
10

membranes can obstruct normal sinus ventilation and drainage. On September 18, 2017, the FDA approved our NDA for XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older. We also plan to initiate additional clinical trials of XHANCE in the fourth quarter of 2018 to seek a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Similar to our NDA for XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps, we believe we will be able to use the FDA's Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for potential U.S. approval for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.
We believe XHANCE could become a part of the standard of care for the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps before they progress to more costly treatment alternatives and could also be adopted as a maintenance therapy to improve outcomes following sinus surgery. We believe the following factors could contribute to the potential success of XHANCE:

▪ | High patient dissatisfaction with current INS treatments. In a market research study that we commissioned, we surveyed 438 patients with chronic sinusitis with and without nasal polyps. In this study, approximately 80% of the patients reported being frustrated with the symptom relief offered from their current INS medication and approximately 90% of the patients reported they would be interested in using a new product if it would improve symptom relief. 


▪ | Strong physician interest in XHANCE product profile. We surveyed approximately 700 physicians, consisting of 400 ENT and allergy specialists and 300 primary care physicians that currently treat patients with chronic sinusitis with and without nasal polyps. Approximately 75% of these physicians, including both specialists and primary care physicians, agreed, in part, that INS medications do not work well in patients with chronic sinusitis due to their belief that conventional INS do not sufficiently reach the high and deep regions of the nasal passages where inflammation occurs. In addition, 70% to 80% of these physicians reported that they would "definitely" or "probably" prescribe their patients a product with a clinical profile similar to XHANCE. 


▪ | Fluticasone propionate is the most widely-prescribed INS in the United States. XHANCE contains fluticasone propionate, a potent, well-characterized, second-generation, anti-inflammatory corticosteroid with a low bioavailability, meaning that only a small percentage of the drug is absorbed into the body. Corticosteroids provide multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action and are used in forms such as pills, creams, inhalers and nasal sprays, to treat many sites of inflammation. 


▪ | XHANCE was designed to overcome the limitations of current INS therapies by delivering medication high and deep in the nasal passages. In multiple studies utilizing advanced imaging, an Optinose EDS produced a differentiated pattern of drug delivery with significant drug deposited at the primary site of inflammation high and deep in the nasal passages where nasal polyps or inflamed and swollen membranes produce nasal symptoms and can obstruct normal sinus ventilation and drainage.


▪ | Strong clinical data demonstrating safety and efficacy. In two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials evaluating adult patients with nasal polyps, we met our co-primary endpoints of statistically significant reductions of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms and total polyp grade. XHANCE also produced treatment benefits in all four defining symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as in polyp elimination, quality of life measures, need for sinus surgery and patient global impression of change. In two supportive open-label Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating approximately 900 patients with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with and without nasal polyps for a period of up to one year, XHANCE was generally well tolerated. In these supportive trials, we observed comparable symptom improvements in patients with and without nasal polyps and continuing incremental polyp reduction and symptom improvement through 12 months. 


▪ | XHANCE is easy to use. In a market study that we commissioned, 98% of patients reported that XHANCE was easy to use after four weeks of use and 93% stated the ease of use was comparable to other INS. 


▪ | Potential for broad payor access. In a market research study that we commissioned, we surveyed 26 health insurance plans representing over 150 million covered lives. Most payors reacted positively to a profile of XHANCE with respect to its product design, mechanism of action and efficacy results based upon our clinical data. This research further suggested that market access for XHANCE will be dependent on XHANCE's pricing. A majority of payors surveyed in our study indicated that they do not intend to actively manage INS products priced below a certain dollar threshold and many surveyed payors indicated that they would provide access without prior authorization to INS products priced within a certain dollar range. The surveyed payors reported the following potential coverage based on the XHANCE profile: (i) no step edits 

11

on plans covering approximately 27% of commercial lives, meaning that payors would not require patients to use generic INS before seeking reimbursement for XHANCE, (ii) a single step edit on plans covering approximately 48% of commercial lives, (iii) a prior authorization requirement on plans covering approximately 10% of commercial lives and (iv) no coverage by plans covering approximately 15% of commercial lives. In addition to this market research study, we obtained formulary data for INS from various sources representing approximately 159 million covered lives. These data indicate that health insurance plans covering 84% of commercial lives do not require prior authorization in the INS category for contracted products. We are actively engaging payors to secure broad market access for XHANCE in the commercial segment by targeting Tier 3 payor coverage, single step edit with no prior authorization. This level of coverage indicates that payors would require patients to use a generic INS as a first step in treating their disease prior to the payor covering XHANCE. However, such coverage would not require the prior authorization of the payor. Tier 3 payor coverage requires a patient co-pay that is higher than that required for generics or drugs within a payor's formulary. We intend to contract with Commercial and Medicare Part D plans and Medicaid to accelerate physician adoption of XHANCE.

▪ | Cost-Effective Solution. We have priced XHANCE comparably to the only other branded INS that is approved to treat nasal polyps, but at a price higher than generic INS products. We believe XHANCE will offer a cost-effective, clinical benefit to payors when compared to surgery and expensive monoclonal antibodies and that this benefit will reduce the perceived need for multiple step-edits and prior authorizations, which we believe will increase the likelihood of successful commercial adoption of XHANCE. 

Optinose EDS
Our exhalation delivery systems enable the development of drug-device combination products intended for self-administration. We have developed both a liquid delivery system and a powder delivery system utilizing natural functional behaviors of the upper nasal airways to offer better drug deposition. These systems are designed to overcome many limitations inherent in conventional nasal spray and nasal aerosol delivery systems, most notably, enabling higher and deeper intranasal drug delivery.
Liquid EDS
The liquid EDS depicted below, which is the EDS used in XHANCE, consists of the primary drug container for the liquid drug formulation, an amber glass vial sealed by a crimp-fitted metering spray pump, enclosed within a proprietary liquid delivery subassembly. The nasal spray applicator, which is a component of the subassembly, is attached to the pump and extends to the top of the nosepiece of the liquid delivery subassembly. The EDS includes a flexible mouthpiece and an asymmetrically-shaped nosepiece as part of a mechanism that uses the patient's exhaled breath to naturally seal closed the soft palate and to facilitate delivery of drug to the nasal passages through the sealing nosepiece. The nosepiece is designed to create a seal with the nostril and also to expand and stent the upper part of the nasal valve, which is an important anatomical structure that is the narrowest part of the entire respiratory tract and a barrier that causes most medication delivered by conventional INS to deposit in the front part of the nose.
12

Powder EDS
The powder EDS depicted below, which is the EDS used in Onzetra Xsail, consists of a reusable device body incorporating a flexible mouthpiece to adjust to individual anatomic variations, and a white button piercing assembly to pierce the medication capsule. Disposable nosepieces are provided in a foil pouch to be inserted into the drug delivery device body. Each pre-filled nosepiece section contains a medication capsule containing a dry powder formulation and a clear release tab. The capsule is pierced by pressing and releasing the white button piercing assembly. The flexible mouthpiece and an asymmetrically-shaped nosepiece are part of the mechanism that uses the patient's exhaled breath to naturally seal closed the soft palate and to facilitate delivery of drug to the nasal passages through the sealing nosepiece. The medication capsule is intended for single dose administration and is not refillable or removable from the nosepiece.
Following drug administration, the disposable nosepiece, including the dose-expended medication capsule, is then removed and discarded.
13

How an Optinose EDS works
When exhaling into an EDS, the soft palate automatically elevates and creates an air-tight seal separating the nasal cavity from the throat and lungs. This natural action is the same as that which prevents air from escaping from the nose when trying to blow up a balloon or blow a trumpet. The exhaled air is then routed through the EDS which introduces medication into the air flow and then directs the air and medication through the sealing nosepiece. The positive air pressure, which is the opposite of the negative pressure produced by sniffing with ordinary nasal sprays, acts to dynamically expand the nasal valve and the narrowed nasal passages, helping to "float" the drug around obstructing anatomic barriers and fill one side of the nasal cavity. This enables high and deep deposition of medication in the nasal passages. The positive air pressure, proportional to the pressure on the other side of the soft palate, helps to open a passage between the two sides of the nasal cavity, behind the back edge of the nasal septum. The picture below illustrates this action, which allows the exhaled air pressure to escape from the opposite nostril.
The drug delivery mechanism of an Optinose EDS is designed to overcome the drug deposition shortcomings of conventional nasal sprays and nasal aerosols. In conventional nasal sprays and nasal aerosols, the medication is inhaled or sniffed into the nose creating negative pressure within the nasal passages, which does not facilitate the expansion of the nasal valve or the nasal passages and may obstruct the drug from reaching deep into the nose where most nasal polyps and inflamed and swollen sinus membranes exist.
The pattern of drug deposition produced by conventional nasal sprays and an Optinose EDS has been evaluated in multiple studies using a combination of advanced imaging modalities to depict the regions of the nasal passages where drug is deposited after administration in human volunteers. In an open label, crossover study conducted by a third party in nine patients with allergic rhinitis, investigators examined the nasal deposition of radio-labeled materials that allow for traceability following use of Qnasl (HFA-beclomethasone, nasal aerosol), Flonase (fluticasone propionate, nasal spray) and Nasonex (mometasone furoate monohydrate, nasal spray). In this study, gamma cameras were used to capture emitted radiation from these tracers to create two-dimensional images in a similar process to the capture of x-ray images. These gamma images were merged with magnetic resonance images, or MRI, to quantify regional deposition within the nasal passages. The images below illustrate how the pattern of drug deposition in the nasal passages produced by Qnasl, Flonase and Nasonex was concentrated in the front and lower regions of the nasal passages, as opposed to the high and deep regions of the nasal passages targeted in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.

We conducted six deposition studies evaluating 53 healthy subjects that produced approximately 250 images. As depicted in the representative figures below, an Optinose EDS produced a differentiated pattern of drug delivery with significantly more drug deposited in the high and deep regions of the nasal passages.
The pictures above use gamma camera image information, which was then superimposed on the corresponding MRI section. These images represent deposition in healthy subjects two minutes after delivery using a traditional liquid nasal spray and a version of our liquid EDS device. Deposition with traditional liquid nasal spray was greatest in the front parts of the nose, whereas deposition with an Optinose EDS was greatest in the high and deep regions of the nose.
The pictures below illustrate how an Optinose EDS (with exhalation) places medication higher and deeper in the nasal passages than a conventional nasal spray (without sniffing) in nasal cast models. As depicted below, although conventional nasal spray systems can reach, and therefore treat, large nasal polyps, they are not suitable for reaching nasal polyps or inflammation in the higher and deeper regions where obstruction of the sinus openings occurs.
An Optinose EDS is also designed to address user dissatisfaction with standard nasal delivery by reducing drug drip-out from the front and back of the nose and the bad taste that often accompanies drug entering the throat. By reducing the loss of drug to non-targeted sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract by swallowing, or lungs, an Optinose EDS has the potential to improve the efficiency of drug activity and to improve tolerability by reducing off-target effects.

Our Pipeline
XHANCE for Chronic Sinusitis
We plan to initiate additional clinical trials of XHANCE in the fourth quarter of 2018 to seek a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. We believe XHANCE would be the first drug therapy product approved for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. In the future, as appropriate, we intend to broaden our commercialization efforts to additional primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In addition, at some point in the future, we intend to consider directing promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million adults who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion.
Other Product Candidates
Although our initial focus is to prioritize the development of XHANCE in the ENT and allergy specialty segments, we have applied an Optinose EDS to other product candidates in our pipeline across a broad range of disease areas. By placing drug high and deep in the nose, in regions where cranial nerves connect directly with the brain, we believe it may be possible to deliver medications directly into the brain and avoid the difficulties of getting drug past the blood-brain barrier. This may enable treatment of brain diseases using small or large molecules that otherwise do not readily enter the nervous system.
OPN-300
We have engaged in early clinical development activities for OPN-300, which combines an Optinose EDS with oxytocin. Oxytocin is a small, naturally occurring peptide currently used to stimulate lactation in breastfeeding women. Oxytocin acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and has recently been considered a potential novel treatment alternative in several brain disorders due to a growing body of evidence of its critical role in social cognition and behavior. Because oxytocin is a peptide with poor oral bioavailability, nasal administration with an Optinose EDS may allow for improved delivery. With standard liquid nasal spray delivery, only a small amount of the drug reaches systemic circulation. It is estimated that less than 0.01% of oxytocin in the blood enters the brain across the blood-brain barrier.
OPN-300 is being developed to target two orphan indications: Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that is the leading genetic cause of obesity; and autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial in late 2013 using OPN-300 in healthy volunteers. In that trial, a low dose of oxytocin delivered using an Optinose EDS produced a statistically significantly greater social-cognitive effect as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, performance on cognitive tests, and physiological markers, than intravenous administration of the same active ingredient that produced blood levels that were not statistically different. We believe this clinical trial supports the possibility of direct nose-to-brain activity of medication delivered using an Optinose EDS. We recently completed a second pilot clinical trial of OPN-300 in adult male patients with autism spectrum disorder. In that trial, adult men with autism spectrum disorder receiving nasal oxytocin showed statistically significant differences in interpretation of 
16

facial expressions. We are preparing for additional clinical development activities in pursuit of an indication for Prader-Willi syndrome.
OPN-021
We are in preclinical development of OPN-021, which combines an Optinose EDS with orexin-A, also known as hypocretin-A, a peptide that acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. OPN-021 is being developed for the treatment of narcolepsy or symptoms of other diseases potentially amenable to the same pharmacologic activity, such as Parkinson's disease. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency of orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus region of the brain. It is clinically characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden and uncontrollable muscle weakness or paralysis and by intrusions into wakefulness of physiological aspects of rapid eye movement sleep. We are in the process of developing the formulation for OPN-021 and are planning to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial when a suitable formulation is prepared.
Other
We are evaluating the use of an Optinose EDS to deliver other drugs or drug combinations, including antibiotics, anticholinergics, antihistamines, mucolytics, leukotriene inhibitors and other medication classes used to treat diseases primarily managed by ENT and allergy specialists. We have also identified several other product candidates with the potential to leverage an Optinose EDS to create clinically differentiated drug treatments for indications such as central nervous system disorders and pain. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop product candidates indicated for markets outside of our ENT and allergy focus through business development activities.
Our Commercial Strategy
We are implementing our commercial strategy for XHANCE to focus on the following three phases of penetrating the chronic rhinosinusitis markets and becoming part of the standard of care treatment:

▪ | Efficient entry in the ENT and Allergy specialty segments: We plan to deploy an efficient, go-to-market commercialization model and have completed the build out of our commercial team and organization. Our fully dedicated specialty sales force of approximately 80 territory managers completed training and initiated promotion of XHANCE in early March 2018 to a defined prescriber base of approximately 6,000 ENT and allergy specialists, as well as approximately 2,000 high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians. Because we expect to secure broader market access over the next 12 to 18 months, we intend to increase the size of our sales force to approximately 120 territory managers based upon an expanded target audience of approximately 14,000 specialists or specialty like primary care physicians. Additionally, we expect to target an additional approximately 1,000 physicians through digital and non-personal promotion in areas where we do not have territory managers. We believe these approximately 15,000 physicians treat an estimated 3.5 million chronic rhinosinusitis patients, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 


▪ | Facilitate broader adoption: We intend to pursue a follow-on indication of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Upon approval for the follow-on indication, we intend to broaden our commercialization efforts to target primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We may target these physicians through a commercial partnership. 


▪ | Activate patient demand: At some point in the future, we intend to consider directing promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million chronic rhinosinusitis sufferers who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion. 

We intend to efficiently launch XHANCE into the ENT and allergy specialty segments by utilizing the following strategies:

▪ | Define a clear patient type for XHANCE. We intend to focus on moderate-to-severely symptomatic patients who have not achieved satisfactory results with currently available INS. 


▪ | Establish a compelling brand position in the medical continuum of care. In an effort to establish our brand position within the continuum of care, we intend to, among other things, educate physicians, payors and patients on XHANCE's unique mechanism of action and differentiated efficacy profile. 

17


▪ | Develop a meaningful payor-friendly value proposition. We intend to establish a meaningful value proposition for physicians, payors and patients by highlighting the potential for XHANCE to reduce or delay the need for surgical intervention, reduce antibiotic prescribing and increase patient satisfaction with treatment outcomes. We believe the health economic data related to XHANCE are compelling. Our analyses show that XHANCE will have a comparatively low pharmacy budget impact and our clinical trial data suggest that XHANCE may produce an offsetting benefit by helping reduce the rate of surgery with its related costs. For an insurance plan, this could represent a potential overall cost reduction for the population of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, as the overall cost of XHANCE would be less than the offsetting costs related to the reduction in surgeries. During clinical studies, XHANCE was also associated with an improvement in reported work productivity in treated patients, which should be valued by employers and patients. Further, we believe the cost of XHANCE to insurance plans will likely be significantly less than the projected costs of monoclonal antibodies that are currently in development for the treatment of nasal polyps. 


▪ | Drive awareness, adoption and access. We are engaging with physicians and payors to educate both constituencies about XHANCE and its benefits, with the goal of securing broad market access for the expected availability of XHANCE through retail pharmacies in early April 2018. 


◦ | Physicians: We are utilizing a clinical nurse educator team to target ENT and allergy specialists to (i) introduce us and highlight the unmet medical need and limitations of current treatments, (ii) increase awareness about XHANCE along with differentiating the EDS and (iii) familiarize healthcare professionals with the proper administration of XHANCE. In addition, beginning in early March 2018 our dedicated sales force started to introduce the XHANCE Xperience program to select physicians. 


◦ | Payors: We are engaging with payors prior to launch with the objective of securing broad market access in the commercial segment by targeting Tier 3 payor coverage, single step edit with no prior authorization. Specifically, we are targeting pharmaceutical benefit managers, national plans and regional plans representing, in the aggregate, up to approximately 160 million of the estimated 180 million U.S. covered commercial lives. 


◦ | Patients: We are building a patient and physician support infrastructure in an effort to accelerate physician adoption and reduce the risk of patient abandonment during the fulfillment process. We expect that this infrastructure may include (i) patient samples, (ii) a co-pay assistance program for patients who have commercial coverage, (iii) savings cards for cash payors, (iv) reimbursement support programs for the retail channel, (v) a "specialized" distribution channel to assist patients with the complexities of the payor landscape, and (vii) a patient assistance program to provide access to XHANCE to people who have no or inadequate insurance. 

Since FDA approval on September 18, 2017, the commercial team has been executing a differentiated, purposeful launch model with the objective of enabling our commercial team to achieve levels of customer awareness, design and implement our customer model, and build market access for XHANCE to facilitate adoption upon making XHANCE broadly available through retail pharmacies in the second quarter of 2018; we now believe XHANCE will be available in retail pharmacies in early April 2018. Our progress across each of these key strategic areas is described below:

▪ | Drive product awareness and appreciation of the clinical differentiation of XHANCE


◦ | Executed broad multi-channel awareness campaign leveraging digital, non-personal promotion and journal advertising and have already reached over 10,000 ENT and allergists


◦ | Launched approximately 85 person nurse educator team calling on a universe of about 7,000 ENT and allergists. This team has reached approximately 5,000 ENT and allergy prescribers and delivered approximately 10,000 presentations to their target audience. Initial reaction to core brand messages among target physicians has been positive.


◦ | Finalized XHANCE core marketing strategies and launch tactic including a compliant, value optimizing and cost-effective promotion mix to appropriately engage our target audience


◦ | Introduced the XHANCE Xperience program to select physicians in early March 2018. This program will offer these physicians and their patients an opportunity to gain initial experience with XHANCE

18


▪ | Design and deploy our customer facing model


◦ | Designed hybrid sales model that leverages a fully dedicated contract sales organization reporting into an Optinose Sales Leadership Team


◦ | Defined footprint of approximately 120 territories that will ultimately target approximately about 14,000 ENTs, allergists and “specialty like” primary care physicians


◦ | Recruited, hired and trained 11 Optinose Regional Business Leaders with an average of approximately 11 years of sales leadership experience


◦ | In partnership with our contract sales organization, approximately 80 Territory Managers, or TMs, were recruited, hired and trained. The TMs have an average of 13 years of pharmaceutical sales experience and over 70% have experience in the respiratory therapeutic category. The TMs were deployed in early March 2018 in geographies where we expect to have greater than 65% coverage of commercial lives during launch.


▪ | Engage commercial payors with the objective of securing tier 3 commercial coverage


◦ | Developed compelling economic value proposition


◦ | Created value pack, budget impact model, supporting health economics and outcomes research, or HEOR, payor messages and payor partnership models


◦ | Completed pricing study to inform pricing decision and contracting strategy and will launch with a Wholesaler Acquisition Cost, or WAC, of $425 per unit of XHANCE


◦ | Created HEOR-related communication tools for use with payors


◦ | Completed development of our clinical and economic evidence of pharmaceuticals in support of formulary consideration using the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, or AMCP, Dossier format


◦ | Engaged with approximately 40 plans representing approximately 85% of commercial lives


◦ | Intend to introduce co-pay assistance program and other patient affordability programs to appropriately support patient access to XHANCE

XHANCE Clinical Development
Overview
We have evaluated XHANCE in the following five clinical trials comprised of over 1,500 patients:

▪ | two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials designed to compare the safety and efficacy of XHANCE to a placebo EDS in adults with bilateral nasal polyps, which we refer to as NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II or collectively, our pivotal clinical trials;


▪ | two open-label Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety of XHANCE in adults with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps, which we refer to as EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12 or collectively, our supportive clinical trials; and


▪ | one Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, bioavailability study to compare the bioavailability of fluticasone propionate from XHANCE to Flonase and Flovent HFA in healthy patients and patients with mild-to-moderate asthma.

Clinical Trial Highlights
Our Phase 3 clinical development program included a population of patients generally reflective of our intended patient population, with approximately 90% having previously tried currently available INS and almost one-third having previously undergone sinus surgery. Key results from our Phase 3 clinical trial program include:

▪ | In our pivotal clinical trials, XHANCE produced statistically significant benefits on both of the co-primary endpoints: a reduction of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms at week 4 and a reduction in total polyp grade at week 16.

19


▪ | Patients with nasal polyps generally experienced greater improvements in symptoms and reductions in polyp grade with longer duration of use.


▪ | In our pivotal clinical trials, approximately 16% of patients treated with XHANCE had nasal polyps eliminated in at least one nostril after 16 weeks of treatment, and approximately 27% had nasal polyps eliminated in at least one nostril after an additional eight weeks of treatment. In our supportive clinical trials, we observed complete response rates in at least one nostril of 48% of patients in EXHANCE-3 and 47.1% of patients in EXHANCE-12.


▪ | In our pivotal clinical trials, XHANCE produced improvement across all four defining symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis.


▪ | Over 85% of patients receiving XHANCE across our pivotal clinical trials reported improvement, and approximately two-thirds reported being "much" or "very much" improved, compared to approximately one-third of patients in the placebo EDS group. In our supportive clinical trials, approximately 70% of patients with symptoms of chronic sinusitis, both with and without nasal polyps, reported that they were "much" or "very much" improved after treatment with XHANCE.


▪ | On a Sinonasal Outcome Test-22, the improvement with the 186- and 372-microgram, or mcg, doses of XHANCE was superior to the placebo EDS in both NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II. The magnitude of improvement associated with treatment with XHANCE was approximately 20 points. Although cross-trial comparisons have significant limitations and must be interpreted with caution, in a previous third-party study evaluating a large cohort (n=1468) of patients who were underwent sinus surgery, the degree of change on this outcome measure was approximately 18 points.


▪ | After 12 months of treatment with XHANCE in our supportive clinical trials, at least 50% of patients had a Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score that was at or below 9.3, which is the average score that has been reported for healthy individuals.


▪ | XHANCE was well tolerated and had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in several comparably designed third party studies, including those of mometasone furoate in nasal polyps patients and of fluticasone propionate formulations in polyposis and allergic rhinitis patients.

Phase 3 Pivotal Clinical Trials (NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II)
We have conducted two independent but comparable randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to examine the safety and efficacy of XHANCE versus a placebo EDS in adults with bilateral nasal polyps and moderate nasal congestion/obstruction. These clinical trials, which we refer to as NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II, also provided dose-ranging information to support the selection of clinically appropriate dose(s) for commercialization of XHANCE and served as pivotal clinical trials in our NDA for the treatment of adults with nasal polyps. These pivotal clinical trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, South Africa and several European countries.
Study Design
Each pivotal clinical trial included a single-blind EDS-placebo lead-in and a placebo EDS control group, a multi-center, multi-national study population to increase generalizability, an assessment of the efficacy of multiple doses (93, 186 or 372 mcg twice daily) over a 16-week period and experts in nasal endoscopy to assess objective efficacy outcomes and adverse events, or AEs, in all patients. Patients who completed the double-blinded phase of the pivotal clinical trials were allowed to continue in an open-label extension phase in which all patients received 372 mcg of XHANCE twice daily for up to eight additional weeks. All patients and investigators remained blinded to the original treatment during the open-label phase, allowing for a comparison of as-randomized initial treatments through the end of the open-label extension phase at week 24. We treated a total of 646 adults across both pivotal clinical trials with 568 adults completing the open-label extension phase.
Each of NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II had co-primary endpoints of (i) change in subjective nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms from baseline to week 4 and (ii) change in objectively-measured total (bilateral) nasal polyp grade from baseline to week 16. The severity of nasal symptoms was recorded by patients in an electronic diary immediately before dosing in the morning (AM) and evening (PM), and was measured using 7-day average instantaneous AM diary scores. Total (bilateral) nasal polyp grading was assessed with nasoendoscopy and is based on polyp protrusion past certain anatomical landmarks. These grading assessments were performed at screening (baseline) and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 (which was the end of the double-blinded phase) and 24 (which was 
20

the end of the open-label phase) using a 0 to 3 point scale for each nostril, with 0 representing no polyps and 3 representing severe polyposis. The scores for each nostril were summed to yield a range of 0 to 6 for both nostrils.
These trials also evaluated several secondary endpoints, including the impact of XHANCE treatment on surgical eligibility and changes in the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score, which considers the core defining signs and symptoms of nasal polyps and the impact on functioning, quality of life and sleep. We also conducted a complete response analysis to evaluate the percentage of patients with a recorded nasal polyp grade of zero on at least one side of the nasal cavity.
Efficacy Results
The 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups achieved statistically significant reductions in the primary assessments of congestion severity at week 4 and reductions in polyp grade at week 16 relative to a placebo EDS. In NAVIGATE I, the differences from the placebo EDS generally increased with each increasing dose of XHANCE for both co-primary endpoints, meaning that administering higher doses to a patient led to a greater decrease in nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms and bilateral nasal polyp grade. In NAVIGATE II, the 186-mcg group achieved the largest numerical reduction in the primary assessment of congestion symptom severity, and the 372-mcg group achieved the largest numerical reduction in the primary assessment of polyp grade. On average, patients in both pivotal clinical trials had moderate nasal polyps (with an average bilateral score of approximately 3.9) at baseline. Patients treated with 372 mcg had the largest mean change in polyp grade in each pivotal clinical trial, with decreases in grade after 16 weeks of 1.1 and 1.4 in NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II, respectively. There was also a consistent decrease in average polyp grade over time through 24 weeks.
The following table summarizes the mean change in congestion scores in each of the pivotal clinical trials:

The following charts summarize the mean change in bilateral nasal polyps score in each of the pivotal clinical trials:

In addition to the co-primary efficacy endpoints described above, we also assessed a number of secondary endpoints in the pivotal clinical trials, including the following:

▪ | Sinonasal Outcome Test-22. In a Sinonasal Outcome Test-22, which broadly assesses the impact of nasal polyps on certain outcomes, including the symptoms of nasal polyps, functioning and quality of life, the change observed with the 186- and 372-mcg doses of XHANCE was superior to the placebo EDS in both of the pivotal clinical trials. The magnitude of improvement associated with treatment with XHANCE was approximately 20 points. 


▪ | Quality of Sleep. A positive impact of XHANCE on sleep was shown for the 372-mcg dose in both pivotal clinical trials through the "Sleep" sub-scale of the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 and, in NAVIGATE II, a positive effect was further shown across a number of the sub-scales of the MOS-Sleep-R, a validated set of measures commonly used in clinical studies to assess changes in sleep quality. 


▪ | Defining Symptoms. The 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups, in pooled data for NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II, achieved statistically significant improvement in all four of the core defining symptoms of nasal polyps at the end of the double-blinded phase. 


▪ | Patient Global Impression of Change. Patient global impression of change is a summary measure of treatment benefit from the perspective of the patient measuring their perception of improvement or worsening of their condition. At the end of the double-blinded phase, the percentage of patients who were improved was substantially higher with XHANCE compared with the placebo EDS. Of the patients receiving 186 or 372 mcg of XHANCE, 86% reported improvement combined across both pivotal clinical trials, and 65.9% reported being "much" or "very much" improved. A post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients in the NAVIGATE I and II trials who were using a marketed INS at the time of study entry showed similar results, with 65% of patients treated with 186 or 372 mcg of XHANCE reporting being "much" or "very much improved" after 16 weeks of treatment compared with 28% of patients treated with the placebo EDS. 


▪ | Need for Surgery. Surgical eligibility was assessed using standardized criteria defined prior to trial initiation. Surgery was not necessarily planned or pending for these patients. The proportion of patients considered eligible for surgery among the 186-mcg and 372-mcg dose groups combined across both pivotal trials was reduced by 54% after 16 weeks of treatment with XHANCE versus 36% with the EDS-placebo group and was reduced by approximately 64% after the additional eight weeks of active treatment with the 372-mcg dose. 


▪ | Complete Response Analysis. The polyp grading scale is neither linear nor a direct measure of polyp mass, making it difficult to interpret mean change scores. Therefore, we also performed a complete response analysis to evaluate the percentage of patients who had nasal polyps eliminated on at least one side of the nasal passages. The percentage of patients who had nasal polyps eliminated on at least one side of the nasal passages at the end of the double-blinded phase was 14.1% in the 186- and 372-mcg dose groups combined across both pivotal clinical trials, compared to 7.8% of placebo EDS recipients. By the end of 24 weeks, after all patients received up to an additional eight weeks of active treatment with the 372-mcg dose, the complete response rate was 17.3% in patients previously treated with the placebo EDS compared 

22

to 26.2% in patients who previously received XHANCE across the 186- and 372-mcg dose groups in both pivotal clinical trials.
Safety Results
XHANCE was generally well tolerated across the 186- and 372-mcg dose groups in NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II. The most commonly reported AEs in the active treatment groups in the pivotal clinical trials, which are shown in the table below, were associated with local effects at the site of administration in the nasal passages or associated with the underlying disease. Most local AEs were not spontaneously reported but were identified as a result of active monitoring of all patients at scheduled intervals by endoscopic nasal examination at each visit. The majority of these AEs were reported to be mild and were observed to resolve with continued use of XHANCE. A total of six patients in the pivotal clinical trials experienced a total of seven serious adverse events, or SAEs, only one of which, in a patient in the placebo group, was determined to be treatment-related. 5.0% of subjects treated with XHANCE 186 mcg twice daily and 1.2% of subjects treated with 372 mcg twice daily discontinued from the clinical trials prior to the open-label extension phase based of adverse reactions compared to 4.3% of subjects treated with placebo.

Phase 3 Open-Label Clinical Trials (EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12)
We also conducted two supportive, open-label Phase 3 clinical trials in adults with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. The supportive clinical trials, which we refer to as EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12, were conducted in the United States with a primary objective to assess the safety of twice-daily intranasal administration of the 372 mcg dose of XHANCE in an expanded number of patients and over an extended period of time. We also assessed a variety of objective and subjective efficacy parameters, including an assessment of each patient's symptoms and functioning and qualification for surgical intervention.
Study Design
Eligibility for enrollment, endpoint and study design were similar in EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12 with the exception of duration (3 months in the case of EXHANCE-3 and 12 months in the case of EXHANCE-12). Across both supportive clinical trials, a total of 898 adults were treated, including 762 adults with chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps and 136 adults with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps.
Safety Results
XHANCE was generally well tolerated. As shown in the table below, 59.2% of patients in the supportive clinical trials experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE, with the most common being similar to those in the XHANCE 
23

treatment groups of the pivotal clinical trials. The most common AEs were local (in the nose) and not systemic. Most AEs were mild and resolved with continued use of XHANCE. A total of 12 patients experienced a total of 14 SAEs in the supportive clinical trials, none of which were deemed treatment-related. Approximately 80% of patients completed the supportive clinical trials, with approximately 5% discontinuing due to an AE and 1% discontinuing for lack of efficacy.

Efficacy Results
Efficacy was also measured in EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12. Key efficacy results from EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12 included:

▪ | On the Lund-Mackay scale, which is an endoscopic objective assessment of disease in the nasal passages, scores for edema, nasal discharge and nasal polyps decreased through up to 12 months of treatment, with similar benefits observed in patients who did or did not have nasal polyps at baseline. Among those patients entering the clinical trials with endoscopic evidence of edema within the nasal cavity, approximately 35% with polyps and 53% without polyps in EXHANCE-3 and 50% with polyps and 56% without polyps in EXHANCE-12 no longer had observable edema by the end of the study.


▪ | Patients with nasal polyps experienced improvement in nasal polyp grades. As observed in the pivotal clinical trials, mean nasal polyp grading scale scores improved more with longer durations of treatment. In addition, the percentage of nasal polyp patients with a polyp grade of 0 on at least one side of the nose was 47.1% in EXHANCE-12 and 48.0% in EXHANCE-3 by the end of their participation in the study.


▪ | Mean total Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 scores improved throughout both supportive clinical trials. After 12 months of treatment with XHANCE in our supportive clinical trials, at least 50% of patients had a score that was at or below 9.3, which is the average score that has been reported for healthy individuals.

Phase 1 Bioavailability Clinical Trial
We performed a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, bioavailability clinical trial of XHANCE and Flonase in healthy patients and XHANCE and Flovent HFA in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. We conducted the Phase 1 clinical trial to establish a bridge between XHANCE, which consists of our fluticasone propionate formulation combined with an Optinose EDS, and Flonase and Flovent HFA, the reference listed drugs for our NDA. We chose fluticasone propionate in part because it has limited absorption into the body. In our NDA, we relied in part on the FDA's previous findings of safety for Flonase and Flovent HFA, including non-clinical toxicology findings and findings of systemic safety risks related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA, axis suppression, which is a known side effect of corticosteroids. To do so, we were required to establish that the systemic exposure, or the 
24

amount of drug absorbed into the body, to fluticasone propionate following use of XHANCE did not exceed the exposure produced by Flovent HFA.
Study Design
Part one of the clinical trial was a three-way, three-treatment, three-sequence crossover study in healthy patients in which patients were randomized to a sequence containing the following treatments: 186 mcg (1 × 93 mcg to each nostril) of XHANCE; 372 mcg (2 × 93 mcg to each nostril) of XHANCE; and 400 mcg (4 × 50 mcg to each nostril) of Flonase. The primary objective of part one was to assess and compare the systemic exposure of a single dose of 186 mcg and 372 mcg of XHANCE with 400 mcg of Flonase in healthy patients. If one or both of the test doses resulted in a systemic exposure that was at least 125% of that of Flonase, then part two was to be conducted. Part two of the clinical trial was a two-way, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover study in mild-to-moderate asthmatic patients in which patients were randomized to a sequence containing the following: 372 mcg (4 × 93 mcg) of XHANCE and 440 mcg (2 × 220 mcg) of Flovent HFA. The primary objective of part two was to assess and compare the systemic exposure produced by a single dose of 372 mcg of XHANCE with 440 mcg of Flovent HFA in mild-to-moderate asthmatic patients. A total of 112 adults were examined across both parts of the clinical trial.
Results
In part one of the clinical trial, peak and total exposure to fluticasone propionate was higher following 372 mcg of XHANCE compared to 400 mcg of Flonase. Peak exposure to fluticasone propionate was also higher for 186 mcg of XHANCE than 400 mcg of Flonase, but total exposure was higher for 400 mcg of Flonase than 186 mcg of XHANCE. In part two of the clinical trial, doses of 372 mcg of XHANCE produced systemic exposure substantially lower than that of 440 mcg of Flovent HFA. In particular, peak plasma of the drug, or Cmax, and the total amount of absorption, known as the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity, or AUC0-∞, were approximately 37% and 50% lower following administration of 372 mcg of XHANCE relative to 440 mcg of Flovent HFA, respectively. We believe these results support our use of Flonase and Flovent HFA as referenced listed drugs in our NDA for XHANCE.
Regulatory Exclusivity and Barriers to Entry
XHANCE benefits from substantial intellectual property and regulatory barriers to entry, including the following:

▪ | Strong patent protection. Our XHANCE U.S. patent portfolio consists of nine issued device and method of use patents expiring through 2030, three issued design patents expiring through 2030 and U.S. patent applications that, if granted, would expire through 2034. We rely primarily on the protections afforded by device and method of use patents. Our issued U.S. patents and patent applications for XHANCE are based on an Optinose EDS, including the combination of this technology with fluticasone propionate. 


▪ | Complex drug-delivery system. We believe the unique features of an Optinose EDS, as well as its delivery of a topical-acting corticosteroid, affords us significant protection against generic competition, as well as against a potential 505(b)(2) NDA, that seeks to reference XHANCE in order to obtain approval for a therapeutically equivalent, substitutable competitor product. XHANCE, utilizing our proprietary EDS, presents human factors engineering complexities for drug-device combination products and chemistry, manufacturing and controls challenges unique to suspension and respiratory products. Any future substitutable generic entrant will need to have considerable combination product know-how to develop and validate a substitutable drug delivery device or technology to compete with an Optinose EDS. 


▪ | Clinical and regulatory complexity. We have conducted a clinical development program comprised of over 1,500 patients to support our NDA for XHANCE to treat nasal polyps, including human factors studies and Phase 3 clinical trial assessments evaluating and validating the use of an Optinose EDS. As with other drugs that primarily have local activity, we believe the regulatory pathway for products seeking approval as substitutable generic equivalents to XHANCE will be more complex and costly than the pharmacokinetic studies generally required for systemically-acting medications. We believe current FDA guidance for substitutable INS generally requires the demonstration of "clinical bioequivalence," which has caused developers to conduct non-inferiority clinical trials. Clinical trials in nasal polyps are different from those that have been performed to support approval of generic INS for allergic rhinitis. We believe potential generic competitors to XHANCE must not only demonstrate efficacy versus placebo, but must also show equivalent efficacy and safety outcomes to establish clinical bioequivalence to XHANCE, requiring a significant amount of time and capital investment and presenting clinical development uncertainties. 

25


▪ | Three-year regulatory exclusivity. The FDA has granted XHANCE a three-year period of regulatory exclusivity that will end in September 2020. This exclusivity means that we are afforded at least three years in which to market our product free of generic or 505(b)(2) competition post-NDA approval. 

Intellectual Property
We strive to protect our proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, as well as know-how, trademarks, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We internally developed our intellectual property related to the Optinose EDS, AVP-825, XHANCE and our product candidates. We have sought and intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our product candidates, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries.
Patents
As of December 31, 2017, we owned a total of 43 U.S. patents and 43 pending U.S. patent applications. These U.S. patents will expire between 2020 and 2030. These U.S. patent applications, subject to issuance, would be projected to expire between 2020 and 2035, with potential patent term adjustments that would extend the patent term. In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we also own 213 foreign issued patents, which will expire between 2020 and 2033 and 117 foreign patent applications, which will expire between 2020 and 2035, subject to issuance. 
Our XHANCE U.S. patent portfolio consists of 9 issued device and method of use patents, three issued design patents and 12 pending patent applications. The 9 device and method of use patents expire between 2020 and 2030, the three design patents expire between 2029 and 2030 and the 12 pending patent applications would be projected to expire, subject to issuance, between 2022 and 2034, with potential patent term adjustments that would extend the patent term. The 9 device and method of use patents are published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA. If any of these potential generic competitors claim that their product will not infringe XHANCE's listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, then they must send notice to us once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, which would automatically prevent the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
 The rest of our patent portfolio largely relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to AVP-825 and other product candidates, including OPN-300 and OPN-021.
Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from business partners and other third parties that receive our confidential information.
Trademarks
We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. OPTINOSE®, XHANCETM and Breath Powered® are trademarks or registered trademarks of ours in the United States.
AVP-825 License Agreement
In July 2013, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OptiNose AS, entered into a license agreement, or the AVP-825 License Agreement, with Avanir pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to Avanir to further 
26

develop and commercialize AVP-825, a combination of an Optinose EDS with a lose-dose sumatriptan powder, for the acute treatment of migraines in adults, in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which we refer to collectively as the Licensed Territory. AVP-825 was approved by the FDA in January 2016 for the acute treatment of migraines in adults and became commercially available in May 2016 under the brand name Onzetra Xsail.
We have received $70.0 million in aggregate licensing revenues to date, consisting of an up-front fee of $20.0 million received in 2013, a $2.5 million payment received in June 2014 upon the achievement of a development milestone and a $47.5 million payment received in February 2016 upon FDA approval of AVP-825. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $50.0 million upon the achievement of annual sales milestones and tiered low double-digit royalty payments once and if net sales of the product exceed a specified cumulative threshold.
Unless earlier terminated in accordance its terms, the AVP-825 License Agreement, including the royalty payments, will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis in the Licensed Territory until the commercial launch of a generic product in such country, at which time the AVP-825 License Agreement, including the royalty payments, will expire as to that particular country. In the United States, which to date is the only jurisdiction in the Licensed Territory in which AVP-825 has been approved for marketing, the commercial launch of a generic version of AVP-825 can occur as soon as the FDA grants marketing approval to a product as a generic to AVP-825. Several patents with respect to AVP-825 are published in the Orange Book, with the last patent expiring in December 2030. A sponsor of a generic version of AVP-825 must use AVP-825 as a reference listed drug in its ANDA, thereby requiring the sponsor to make one of several certifications regarding each AVP-825 patent listed in the Orange Book. A "Paragraph III" certification is the sponsor's statement that it will wait for the applicable patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A "Paragraph IV" certification is an assertion that the applicable patent does not block approval of the generic product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the generic product. If a sponsor of a generic version of AVP-825 files a "Paragraph III" certification with respect to each of the AVP-825 patents listed in the Orange Book, then the earliest the FDA will grant marketing approval to the generic product is December 2030. If, however, a sponsor of a generic version of AVP-825 files a "Paragraph IV" certification challenging AVP-825's Orange Book-listed patents, then, within 20 days of the FDA accepting the filing, the sponsor must provide notice to us and Avanir that an ANDA has been filed with the FDA, and provide the factual and legal basis for the sponsor's assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If we or Avanir file suit against the applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. If the sponsor is unsuccessful in its defense of non-infringement or unable to prove invalidity of the listed patents, the court could issue an injunction prohibiting the launch of the generic version of AVP-825 until the last patent expires in December 2030.
Avanir may terminate the AVP-825 License Agreement in its sole discretion upon prior written notice to us as described in the agreement. We may terminate the AVP-825 License Agreement if Avanir commences any legal or administrative proceeding to revoke or challenge the validity of certain of the intellectual property we licensed to Avanir pursuant to the AVP-825 License Agreement. In addition, the AVP-825 License Agreement provides for customary termination rights in the event of a breach of the AVP-825 License Agreement by the other party.
Manufacturing and Distribution
Manufacturing
As of February 2018, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements for the initial commercial supply of XHANCE and for the XHANCE Xperience program. 
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture, testing and storage of our product candidates. In our experience, contract manufacturers, or CMOs, are generally cost-efficient and reliable and therefore we currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial manufacturing capabilities. Because we rely on CMOs, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among other activities. Our systems and our contractors are required to comply with these regulations, and we assess this compliance regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 
27

We have entered into the following key supply agreements for the commercial manufacture and supply of XHANCE:

▪ | In July 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with Hovione Inter Ltd, or Hovione, for the supply of fluticasone propionate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient included in the liquid suspension formulation. This agreement has a term of five years from commercial launch of XHANCE, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Either we or Hovione may terminate the agreement prior to that date for uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the agreement in the event Hovione, among other things, (i) loses any required FDA approval rendering it unable to fulfill its contractual obligations, (ii) is engaged in felonious or fraudulent activities or (iii) does not submit a Corrective and Preventive Action plan to the FDA within a specified period of time of being notified of deficiencies in Hovione's facility.


▪ | In August 2017, we entered into a manufacture and supply agreement with Contract Pharmaceuticals Limited Canada, or CPL, for the formulation and assembly of the finished drug product during the fill/pack operation. This agreement has a term of five years from the date on which we provide a purchase order for validation batches to CPL, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Either we or CPL may terminate the agreement prior to that date by mutual consent or for uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the agreement if, among other things, any intellectual property of any third party is reasonably alleged by a third party to be infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by the manufacture, import, use, sale or distribution of XHANCE or if any regulatory authority requires us to cease production of the sale of XHANCE.


▪ | In August 2017, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement with Ximedica, LLC for the manufacture of the liquid delivery sub-assembly, which consists of injection molded parts and other purchased components. This agreement has a term of two years from September 18, 2017, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Either we or Ximedica may terminate the agreement prior to that date for uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice or if Ximedica (i) fails an inspection or suffers a disciplinary action by a governmental authority and fails to cure such issue within a specified period of time or (ii) fails to gain recommendation for approval by the FDA to manufacture the liquid delivery subassembly component to be manufactured pursuant to the agreement.

We believe our third-party manufacturers have adequate capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of XHANCE to meet anticipated commercial demands.
Distribution
We have established a distribution channel in the United States for the commercialization of XHANCE. We will be selling XHANCE to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who, in turn, will sell XHANCE to pharmacies, hospitals and other customers. We have also established a full-service pharmacy channel to whom we will sell XHANCE, who, in turn, will sell XHANCE directly to patients. We have contracted with a third-party logistics provider for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, and distribution. Further, our third-party logistics provider will provide customer order fulfillment services and accounts receivable management. 
The initial supply of XHANCE necessary for our XHANCE Xperience program has been manufactured and delivered to a full-service pharmacy which coordinates fulfillment, shipping product directly to patients. XHANCE has already been provided to initial patients in this program. Our initial commercial supply of XHANCE has been delivered to our third-party logistics provider and we expect XHANCE to be in retail distribution channels by late March 2018 so that it is available in retail pharmacies in early April 2018. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as research provides a deeper understanding of the pathology of diseases and new technologies and treatments are developed. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and, to a lesser degree, medical device companies.
XHANCE will compete primarily with INS, oral steroids and other medical management products, including locally compounded liquid budesonide in high-volume nasal rinses. XHANCE will also compete with surgical procedures, balloon sinus dilation products and steroid-releasing sinus implants. Key competitive factors affecting the

commercial success of XHANCE and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement.
The only other branded INS on the market indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps is Nasonex, which is marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. A generic version of Nasonex, mometasone furoate monohydrate, was approved by the FDA for, among other indications, the treatment of nasal polyps and launched in 2016. In addition, Beconase AQ, which is an INS marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, is indicated for the prophylaxis of nasal polyps after surgical resection. There are no products approved for the treatment of chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps. There are two categories of INS: first-generation INS products, which include Rhinocort, Nasacort AQ and Qnasl; and second-generation INS products, which include Flonase, Veramyst, Omnaris and Zetonna. The primary difference between first- and second-generation INS products is that first-generation INS are absorbed into the blood to a greater extent than second-generation INS, with systemic bioavailability ranging from 10% to 50% compared to a systemic bioavailability with fluticasone propionate, a second-generation INS, of less than 2%. Many of the most widely-prescribed INS products are available in generic form and some, such as Flonase (which contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as XHANCE), are available over-the-counter.
Several companies are also currently developing biologic monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of nasal polyps. These biologic monoclonal antibodies, which inhibit specific pathways of inflammation present in nasal polyps, include omalizumab, reslizumab, mepolizumab and dupilumab. Omalizumab has been studied in investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trials. GlaxoSmithKline has studied mepolizumab in a sponsor-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial and has initiated patient enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical trial with study completion anticipated in 2019. Dupilumab has been studied in a sponsor-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial and Sanofi is currently investigating it in two Phase 3 clinical trials that is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018. If these biologic monoclonal antibodies are successfully developed and approved for marketing, they could represent significant competition for XHANCE.
Research and Development 
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately $16.8 million, $15.3 million, and $22.2 million respectively. 
Government Regulation
As a pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, and FDA's implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, because that is currently our primary focus, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing, our products in other countries in the future. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences.
Development and Approval
Under the FD&C Act, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the United States. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant.
Preclinical Testing.    Before testing any compound in human patients in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application.    Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an investigational new drug, or IND, application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop a clinical trial by placing it on "clinical hold" because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
29

Clinical Trials.    Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA's bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of AEs. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
A study sponsor is required to publicly post specified details about certain clinical trials and clinical trial results on government or independent websites (e.g., http://clinicaltrials.gov). Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:

▪ | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human patients, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.


▪ | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop initial data regarding the product's effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential AEs.


▪ | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug's overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen.

The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
NDA Submission and Review.    The FD&C Act provides two pathways for the approval of new drugs through an NDA. An NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure its identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA contains results of the full set of preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate.
Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval for new formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug, or RLD, and submit its own product-specific data — which may include data from preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant — to address differences between the product candidate and the RLD. We obtained FDA approval of XHANCE through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, with Flonase and Flovent HFA as the RLDs. Flonase and Flovent HFA contain fluticasone propionate, which is also used in XHANCE.
30

The submission of an NDA under either Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity. For some NDAs, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to seek insights and recommendations on issues relevant to approval of the application. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations.
Our product and product candidates include products that combine drug and device components in a manner that the FDA considers to meet the definition of a "combination product" under FDA regulations. The FDA exercises significant discretion over the regulation of combination products, including the discretion to require separate marketing applications for the drug and device components in a combination product. For XHANCE, FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, had primary jurisdiction for review of the NDA, and both the drug and device were reviewed under one marketing application. However, for a drug-device combination product CDER typically consults with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health in the NDA review process.
The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must also include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
Once an NDA submission has been accepted for filing — which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA — the FDA's goal for a non-priority review of an NDA is ten months. The review process can be and often is significantly extended, however, by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. After review of an NDA, the FDA may decide to not approve the application or may issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The complete response letter also may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor.
Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as "Phase 4" or "post-marketing" studies. For example, the FDA originally required us to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group clinical study in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age with bilateral nasal polyps associated with nasal congestion to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of XHANCE in improving nasal polyp grade and symptoms (nasal congestion/obstruction, sense of smell, rhinorrhea and facial pain or pressure). On October 30, 2017, the FDA notified us that in response to our request it had modified the required age range to 12 to 17 years of age. We submitted our final protocol to the FDA with respect to the pediatric study by January 2018 as required, and we are required to complete the study by January 2022 and submit a final report with respect to the study by July 2022. 
Post-approval modifications to the drug, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval.
Post-Approval Regulation
Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials if new safety information develops.
31

Good Manufacturing Practices.    Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
It is also likely that we will need to comply with some of FDA's manufacturing regulations for devices. FDA has discretion in determining post-approval compliance requirements for products that combine a drug substance with a delivery system device. In addition to cGMP, FDA may require that our drug-device combination product, if approved, comply with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth the FDA's manufacturing quality standards for medical devices.
Advertising and Promotion.    The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, advertising and promotion to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for "off-label" uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and not described in the product's labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced, scientific communication regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug.
Other Requirements.    NDA holders must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records.
Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products.
Generic Drugs.    A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product's safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.
505(b)(2) NDAs.    As discussed above, if a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Unlike an ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed product's safety and effectiveness. Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on the FDA's finding that the RLD is safe and effective, and must submit its own 
32

product-specific data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products. An NDA approved under 505(b)(2) may in turn serve as an RLD for subsequent applications from other sponsors.
RLD Patents.    In an NDA, a sponsor must identify patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent. A "Paragraph III" certification is the sponsor's statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A "Paragraph IV" certification is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product.
Regulatory Exclusivities.    The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a "new chemical entity," or NCE — generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug — there is a period of five years from the product's approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a Paragraph IV certification.
A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains new clinical data, derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data.
Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant's assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
Patent Term Restoration.    A portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration. When any of our products is approved, we intend to seek patent term restoration for an applicable patent when it is appropriate.
Other Exclusivities
Pediatric Exclusivity.    Section 505A of the FD&C Act provides for six months of additional exclusivity or patent protection if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data does not need to show that the product is effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any product is approved, we will evaluate seeking pediatric exclusivity as appropriate.
33

Orphan Drug Exclusivity.    The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication generally is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. We may seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for OPN-300, which we are developing for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Affordable Care Act, is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the "donut hole"), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service's 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Details of the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and the 340B program are discussed under the risk factor "If we are able to successfully commercialize XHANCE and if we participate in but fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects" in the "Risk Factors" section of this 10-K.
Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval, business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the Affordable Care Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
Certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act have occurred in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the Affordable Care Act required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price for Medicare Part D beneficiaries during their coverage gap period beginning in 2019. Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changed under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. 
We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or replaced in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
U.S. Tax Reform - 2017 U.S. Tax Reform 
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted major tax reform legislation, Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). The 2017 Tax Act imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%.
34

Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payors, such as commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover and the amount of reimbursement they will provide for a covered drug. In the U.S., there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costly studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct pharmacoeconomic studies, our products and product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by payors. Further, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
In the past, payors have implemented reimbursement metrics and periodically revised those metrics as well as the methodologies used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, or ASP, average manufacturer price, or AMP, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, surveys and publishes retail pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates.
Participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program would require us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the "basic" portion of the rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price available from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer, or Best Price. AMP must be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis only. In addition, the rebate also includes the "additional" portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an "inflation penalty" when the drug's latest quarter's AMP exceeds the drug's AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index-Urban. The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for our drug. The terms of our participation in the program would impose a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision.
Federal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer's drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B "ceiling price" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations. Health care reform also made changes to the 340B program by expanding the list of covered entities eligible for 340B participation to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals. Health care reform obligates the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS), to create regulations 
35

and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program. On January 5, 2017, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the HHS that administers the 340B drug pricing program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. The effective date of the regulation has been delayed until July 1, 2018. Implementation of this final rule and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways that we cannot presently anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.
In the U.S. Medicare program, outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C.
Coverage and reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs under Part D are not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Although Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques.
The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and other cost reduction initiatives in the program could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we expect to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we would be obligated to make our "innovator" drugs available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies — the VA, U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guard — that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also expect to participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we would pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP.
Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government or fails to submit the required price data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the manufacturer's Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. In addition, claims submitted to federally-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for drugs priced based on incorrect pricing data provided by a manufacturer can implicate the federal Civil False Claims Act.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.

Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. If Congress does not take action in the future to modify these sequestrations, Medicare Part D plans could seek to reduce their negotiated prices for drugs. Other legislative or regulatory cost containment legislation could have a similar effect.
Further, the Affordable Care Act may reduce the profitability of drug products. It expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016.
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $4.1 billion in 2018, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service's 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. It appears likely that the Affordable Care Act will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration, as discussed above under the heading "U.S. Healthcare Reform." In addition, there likely will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. Thus, even if we obtain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for any products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Additional information regarding these programs is discussed under the risk factor "If we are able to successfully commercialize XHANCE and if we participate in but fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects" in the "Risk Factors" section of this 10-K.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our business will be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, particularly once third-party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes.
The federal Anti-kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. The Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceuticals, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, speakers or advisors, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance

programs. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and do not fit within an exception or safe harbor are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, based on the facts and circumstances, they violate the statute.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the federal civil False Claims Act may be brought by private individuals known as qui tam relators in the name of the government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False Claims Act for, among other things, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, inflating prices reported to private price publication services which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs, and other interactions with prescribers and other customers including interactions that may have affected customers' billing or coding practices on claims submitted to the federal government. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company's marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the previous calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Compliance with such laws and regulations will require substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity.

Healthcare Privacy Laws
We may be subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity.
Employees
As of March 1, 2017, we had a total of 78 full-time employees (including 3 in the United Kingdom and 1 in Norway) and 4 part-time employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our current relations with our employees to be good.
Properties
Our principal office is located in Yardley, Pennsylvania, where we lease approximately 30,000 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in May 2021. We also lease facilities in Ewing, New Jersey, Oslo, Norway and Swindon, England. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, although we may seek to negotiate new leases or evaluate additional or alternate space for our operations. We believe appropriate alternative space will be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
