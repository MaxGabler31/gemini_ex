Item 1. Business
Overview
 
The Company holds a 50% interest in a gold and silver mine and was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The Soledad Mountain Mine (the “Mine”) is located south of Mojave in Kern County in southern California.
 
The Company acquired its initial interest in the Mine in 1985 and has since added to its landholdings and interests in the area. Exploration and evaluation work on the Mine was done by Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC (“GQM LLC”), formerly Golden Queen Mining Co., Inc. (“GQM Inc.”) a California corporation that was wholly-owned by the Company until September 2014.
 
Golden Queen accounts for GQM LLC in its financial statements as a variable interest entity (“VIE”), with Golden Queen considered to be the primary beneficiary.  A VIE is an entity in which the investor, Golden Queen, holds a controlling interest, or in this case, is a primary beneficiary, that is not based on the majority of the voting rights. As a result, Golden Queen continues to reflect 100% of the financial results of GQM LLC in its consolidated financial statements, along with a non-controlling interest representing the 50% interest in GQM LLC held by Gauss LLC.
 
The registered office of the Company is located at 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 2T8 and its executive offices are located at 2300 – 1066 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6E 3X2. The California office of GQM LLC is located at 2818 Silver Queen Road, Mojave, California, 93501.

The following chart depicts the corporate structure of the Company of each of our material subsidiaries and related holding companies. All ownership is 100% unless otherwise indicated.

On December 31, 2018, we had two (2) full-time employees. GQM LLC had 221 full-time employees. We also engage various consultants and contractors with specific skills to assist with various aspects of the Mine.
Recent Developments 
 
Commercial production was announced on December 19, 2016 and 2017 was the first full year of production at the Mine occurred in 2017. Please refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the 2018 operational update.
 
On February 20, 2018, the Company completed a rights offering resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $25,000, of which $10,000 was contributed into GQM LLC. In addition, Gauss LLC, the Company’s joint venture partner, also contributed $10,000 into GQM LLC. The funding contributed into GQM LLC was used be available to settle accounts payable, equipment finance obligations and the credit facility relating to the Soledad Mountain mine in the normal course of business. The rights offering was backstopped by the Clay Group, which provided certainty of the amount raised, and allowed for shareholder participation. The Company issued the full allotment of 188,952,761 common shares pursuant to the rights offering.
 
Despite the extensive efforts of our management and the Board, operations at the Soledad Mountain Project have not generated a profit and require significant additional cash to continue. Golden Queen has been unable to attract sufficient capital, other than through loans and investment from members of the Clay family and associated entities (the “Clay Group”). Members of the Clay Group have been involved with Golden Queen for many years. Thomas M. Clay was a director of Golden Queen since January 2009, Chairman of the Board since May 2013 and Chief Executive Officer since August 2015, and resigned prior to the signing of the Share Purchase Agreement. Members of the Clay Group have made significant investments in, and provided multiple loans to, Golden Queen in the past. In addition, 50% of GQM LLC is owned by Gauss LLC. 75.46% of Gauss LLC is owned by Gauss Holdings LLC (wholly-owned by Jefferies Financial Group), and the remaining 24.54% is owned by Auvergne LLC, an investment entity of the Clay Group.

Recent financing by members of the Clay Group included the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement dated as of November 21, 2016, as amended (the “GQM Loan”). The GQM Loan for was a principal amount of US$31 million, due on May 21, 2019 with an annual interest rate of 8%, payable quarterly. In connection with the GQM Loan, Golden Queen issued 8,000,000 common share purchase warrants exercisable for a period of five years expiring November 21, 2021. In November 2017, Golden Queen and the Clay Group agreed to amend the GQM Loan by reducing the 2018 quarterly and 2019 first quarter principal payments from US$2.5 million to US$1 million, adding the reduction of such payments pro-rata to the remaining 2019 payments, and increasing the annual interest rate from 8% to 10% effective January 1, 2018. A payment of $1.7 million under the GQM Loan was due on January 1, 2019 but was extended to February 1, 2019 and then further extended to February 8, 2019 to allow Golden Queen to avoid making any payments in the context of the eventual Transaction. Any payments under the GQM Loan have been further waived and postponed until after the Meeting in exchange for a fee of $0.125 million with such fee to be added to the outstanding balance under the GQM Loan such that Golden Queen will make no further payments under the GQM Loan if the Shareholders approve the Transaction at the Meeting and all other conditions to closing as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement are met.
 
The Clay Group has also provided loans to GQM LLC, through Gauss LLC, to fund operation and development of the Soledad Mountain Project. In October 2018, GQM LLC entered into an agreement with Gauss Holdings LLC and Auvergne LLC (the “Lenders”) whereby the Lenders extended a revolving credit loan facility to GQM LLC (the “Facility”) in the amount of US$20 million. Under the terms of the agreement, the maturity date of the Facility is March 31, 2020 and the annual interest rate on drawn amounts is 8%. GQM LLC has made an initial US$5 million draw on the Facility. In connection with the Facility, the Lenders were issued 21,486 warrants (the “GQM LLC Warrants”), with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase a unit of GQM LLC for a period of five years at an exercise price of $475.384 per unit. The GQM LLC Warrants represent a fully-diluted 7.5% interest in the equity of GQM LLC. If the GQM LLC warrants are exercised, Golden Queen’s interest in GQM LLC will be diluted to 46.25% from the current 50%. The Facility is secured by a pledge of Golden Queen’s equity interest in GQM LLC.
 
The Board has from time to time separately engaged with the management of the Company in reviews and discussions of potential strategic alternatives for the Company, and has constantly been considering ways to enhance its performance and prospects. These reviews and discussions have focused on, among other things, the business environment facing the industry generally and the Company and its current and future liabilities in particular. These reviews have also included periodic discussions with respect to potential transactions that would further its strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value, and the potential benefits and risks of those transactions. The Company has been working with Maxit Capital LP (“Maxit”) since 2015 to explore alternative transactions to generate value and identify alternative financing or merger and acquisition opportunities for the Company.
 
During the period between September 2018 and January 4, 2019, Thomas M. Clay first engaged in discussions with the Board and the management of the Company regarding the existing indebtedness of the Company to the Clay Group and the impending debt payment deadlines under the GQM Loan. Mr. Clay informed the Board and the management of the Company that the Clay Group and its related entities would no longer extend the GQM Loan or provide further financing to the Company.
 
On January 4, 2019, Mr. Clay on behalf of the Purchasers, delivered a preliminary, non-binding proposal letter (the “Non-Binding Term Sheet”) to the Company detailing a proposal to acquire all of the Company’s interests in GQM LLC for a purchase price consisting mainly of the extinguishment of all indebtedness owing to the Purchasers under the GQM Loan, the surrender of all Shares, warrants and options of the Company held by the Purchasers for cancellation and a cash payment of $3 million. The Non-Binding Term Sheet also included a 30-day go-shop period among other terms. The Non-Binding Term Sheet was subsequently filed on EDGAR on January 7, 2019 and a corresponding news release and early warning report were filed on SEDAR on January 7, 2019 by the Purchasers.
 
On January 11, 2019, the Board formed the Special Committee along with a special committee mandate and appointed Paul Blythe, Bryan Coates and Bernard Guarnera, all being independent directors of the Company, and retained independent legal counsel to advise the Company and the Special Committee of its rights and obligations in connection with the Non-Binding Term Sheet.

Following the initial meeting the Special Committee outlined a counter proposal to the Purchasers providing for a significant increase in the cash component of the purchase price as well as a number of other provisions for the benefit of the Company post-transaction. At the same time, the Special Committee directed management of the Company to engage with Maxit on specific steps to be taken to identify alternatives to the proposal from the Purchasers and alternative avenues of financing that could be pursued to replace the indebtedness held by the Purchasers. The Purchasers rejected the Company’s counter proposal, but discussions continued between representatives of the two (2) groups. Over the course of the following four (4) weeks, the Special Committee met a total of eight (8)] times.
 
During the course of the Special Committee meetings, Mr. Blythe was appointed chair of the committee and the members discussed all available alternatives and the results of the ongoing discussions between the Company and the Purchasers. Independent legal counsel was asked to advise on the legal considerations relevant to the discussions with input from regular company counsel as well as US counsel to the Company. The Special Committee received advice on the avenues available to the Company if it were to pursue a proceeding under either Canadian or US insolvency protections in order to secure further time to identify alternative transactions. During this period of time, Maxit worked with the Company to reach out to entities that had historically shown interest in transacting with the Company, and fielded numerous inbound inquiries from parties that had become aware of the public announcement of the proposal from the Purchasers. During this period contact was made with a number of interested parties by the Company or its advisors. In parallel to these discussions, the Company retained EY on January 18, 2019 to commence work in support of an eventual Formal Valuation and Fairness Opinion in the event that an alternative transaction was not identified.
 
On January 30, 2019, the Special Committee met with Canadian and US legal counsel to the Company, independent counsel to the Special Committee, Maxit and EY to review the status of negotiations with the Purchasers, to receive an update on Maxit’s work to identify alternatives to the proposal from the Purchasers and to hear EY’s Preliminary Valuation and Fairness Opinion. At the conclusion of this discussion the Special Committee determined that a formal proposal to the Purchasers should be made. The formal proposal was delivered to counsel to the Purchasers and was not accepted, as a result of which discussions continued for several more days until on February 5 an agreement was reached on the material terms of the transaction to be pursued including a longer go shop period, a lower break fee payable by the Company in the event of a Superior Proposal during the go shop period, the addition of the contingent payment and an increase in the cash component payable to the Company by the Purchasers. The agreed upon material terms were reflected in a final letter of intent (the “Final Letter of Intent”).
 
Mr. Clay resigned as Golden Queen’s Chief Executive Officer and from the board of directors and all managerial positions with Golden Queen, Golden Queen Mining Canada Ltd. (“GQM Canada”) and GQM US, as applicable, prior to entering into the Share Purchase Agreement. As such, the members of the Special Committee constituted all of the directors of the Company and the recommendation and approval of the members of the Special Committee represented the recommendation and approval of the Board.
 
Having undertaken a thorough review of, and carefully considered, information concerning the Transaction and the Preliminary Valuation and Fairness Opinion from EY and after consulting with its financial and legal advisors, the Special Committee unanimously determined that the Transaction is advisable and is in the best interests of, the Company, and adopted and declared advisable the Transaction, authorized the entering into of the Final Letter of Intent and the Share Purchase Agreement to be settled based on the Final Letter of Intent, and recommended that the Shareholders vote FOR the Transaction Resolution.
 
On February 5, 2019, the Final Letter of Intent was filed on EDGAR and a corresponding news release was disseminated on the same day.
 
Through and until February 7, 2019, the Company, the Purchasers and their legal counsels worked to finalize the Share Purchase Agreement and related documents based on the Final Letter of Intent. The Share Purchase Agreement was executed by the Purchasers and the Company later that day and a news release relating thereto was disseminated.
 
Following execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company worked with Maxit to ensure that all interested parties that could be considered alternatives to the Transaction were again contacted and made aware of the specific terms of the transaction. Paul Blythe, as chair of the Special Committee met weekly with management and Maxit to monitor progress and provide input.

There are a number of risks associated with the Mine and readers are urged to consider these risks and possible other risks, in order to obtain an understanding of the Mine (see Item 1A. Risk Factors below).
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The Company and GQM LLC compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees, for supplies and equipment, as well as for capital. As a result of this competition in the mining industry, some of which is with large established mining companies holding substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours, we may be unable to effectively develop and operate the Mine or obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable.
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Our current and planned operations are subject to state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations provide strict standards for compliance, and potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. These laws address emissions, waste discharge requirements, management of hazardous substances, protection of endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires significant time and expense, and future changes to these laws and regulations may cause material changes or delays in the development of our Mine or our future activities on site.
 
See Environmental Issues, Permits & Approvals below for a detailed description of the effects of federal, state and local environmental regulations and permitting on the Company, GQM LLC and the Mine, as well as Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the related risks.
 
Gold and Silver Price History
 
The price of gold and silver are volatile and are affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold and silver by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the US dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold and silver demand and political and economic conditions.
