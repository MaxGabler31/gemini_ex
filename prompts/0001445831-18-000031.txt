ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
 All State Properties L.P., a limited partnership (the “Partnership”) was organized under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of Delaware on April 27, 1984 to conduct the business formerly carried on by its predecessor corporation, All State Properties, Inc. (the “Corporation”); and together with the Partnership, the “Company”. In March 2007 Hubei Longdan (Delaware), Inc. (“Longdan Delaware” and “Subsidiary”) was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Longdan Delaware had only nominal assets and no liabilities and had conducted no activities except in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement.  The Company together with Longdan Delaware referred to herein as the “Registrant”. Pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation adopted by shareholders of the Corporation on September 30, 1984, the Corporation transferred substantially all of its assets to the Partnership, and the Corporation distributed such limited partnership interests to its shareholders. The Registrant was engaged since inception in land development and the construction and sale of residential housing in various parts of the eastern United States and in Argentina with its most recent transactions being in Florida.
 
Since August 1999, the Company’s only business has been the ownership of a member interest of approximately 35% in Tunicom LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Tunicom”). An affiliate of Tunicom was engaged in the ownership and operation of an adult rental apartment complex until the sale of the apartment complex in August 2000. Since that time, Tunicom’s only business was activities relating to its attempts to sell its only remaining asset, five acres of commercial and residential land in Broward County, Florida (the “Remaining Property”). For a description of the sale of the Remaining Property by Tunicom and the liquidating distribution by the Company, see Item 1(b)(i). Following the completion of the transactions described in Item 1(b)(ii) the Company became a “shell company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) because it has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets (other than cash). In March 2007, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement which contemplates a reverse merger with a private operating Chinese pharmaceutical company provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including approval of the transaction by its partners (See Item 1(b)(ii)).
 
On November 2, 2007, the Company terminated the Acquisition Agreement based on the breach of its terms by Longdan.
 
On December 20, 2007, Belmont Partners, LLC (“Belmont”), a Virginia limited liability company, entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Company and Stanley R. Rosenthal, an individual resident of the State of Florida ("Rosenthal").
 
On March 3, 2008, Greenwich Holdings LLC (“Greenwich”), a New York limited liability company, entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Company and Joseph Meuse, as General Partner of the Company and a Managing Member of Belmont Partners, LLC (“Belmont”), a Virginia limited liability company.

Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Belmont (the “Seller”), sold to Greenwich (the “Buyer”) fifty and one one-thousandth percent (50.001%) of the issued and outstanding partnership units (“Units”), which shall be not more than nine million Units (9,000,000) of the Company for one hundred eighty eight thousand U.S. dollars ($188,000.00). In conjunction with the Agreement, brokers in the transaction received 1,150,000 units and Garry McHenry received 200,000 units as compensation as the new general partner. Greenwich then received their 50.001% or 4,471,000 Units of the Company.  As of March 31, 2008, the outstanding Units issued totaled 8,809,065.
 
On May 29, 2008, our predecessor, All State Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“ASP”), and All State Properties Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ASP (“ASPH”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger.  On May 29, 2008, ASP merged with and into ASPH, so that ASP and ASPH became a single corporation named All State Properties Holdings, Inc. (the “Surviving Corporation”), which is a corporation and exists under, and is governed by, the laws of the State of Nevada (the “Merger”).
 
As a result of the Merger, all of the assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of ASP became vested in, held and enjoyed by the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of ASP and we changed our name from “All State Properties, L.P.” to “All State Properties Holdings, Inc.”
 
Upon the effectiveness and as a result of the Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of ASPH became the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.
 
In addition, each share of common stock of ASP that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into 1 issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (“Common Stock”), so that the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ASP immediately prior to the Merger are the holders of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. All shares of ASPH owned by ASP immediately prior to the Merger were surrendered to the Surviving Corporation and cancelled.
 
All State Properties Holdings, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 24, 2008. All State Properties Holdings, Inc. is to serve as a vehicle to effect a merger, exchange of capital stock, asset acquisition, or other business combination with a domestic or foreign private business.  The company not commenced planned principal operations.  The Company has a June 30 year end. As of June 30, 2018, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock totaled 2,964,181,540.

Longdan had agreed to pay all costs associated with the Acquisition, including legal fees incurred in connection with the related corporate law transactions and required filings under the securities laws, and had also agreed to pay for any costs incurred by the Company in connection with maintaining its registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, after June 30, 2007.
