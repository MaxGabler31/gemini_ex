Overview
 
Organization and Business
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2013. On April 2, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Scythian Mining Group Ltd. (“SMG”), a United Kingdom company, to acquire 100% interest in SMG-Gold B.V. (“SMG-Gold”), a Dutch limited liability company (the “SMG-Gold Acquisition”). While the Exchange Agreement was closed on July 7, 2020, it was never finalized because consideration for the transaction was never fully exchanged. On November 18, 2020, our Board of Directors voted unanimously to rescind the transaction and return the SMG-Gold shares to SMG. See Note 3 for additional information.
 
On January 8, 2021, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Provenance Gold Corporation, a Canadian publicly traded company (“PAU”) to fund and develop a series of 102 lode mineral claims and one (1) patented mining claim, all of which are located in Nye County in the State of Nevada (the “Venture”). Subsequent to the closing of the JV Agreement, both parties deemed it in their best interests not to move forward with the Venture based on various factors, including, but not limited to, an inability to raise sufficient capital to support the Venture. Accordingly, on March 22, 2021, we entered into a Rescission Agreement with PAU rescinding and rendering null and void the JV Agreement, and returning any funds advanced by either party in connection with the JV Agreement.
 
On May 10, 2021, we issued a press release stating our Company was changing its market focus as our management recognized that our Company needs to move in a new direction and will pursue acquisition opportunities that can benefit private companies through our Company’s public status. The benefit to our Company and its shareholders will be built on acquisitions based on growth and revenue of targeted acquisitions.
 
We are restructuring our Company as a holding company seeking transactions on a managed basis, acquiring controlling interest in acquisition targets as subsidiaries of our Company. Using a holding company strategy, we will be able to mitigate risk while making multiple acquisitions. All targeted acquisitions must be audited or auditable. We will make either majority or minority investments in companies that meet its investment criteria.
 
As a holding company, we will not manufacture anything, sell any products or services, or conduct any other business operations. Our purpose is to hold the controlling stock or membership interests in other companies.
 
Our Company is taking an agnostic approach regarding industry, in almost every contemplated acquisition, we will retain the management team of the acquired company. The subsidiary’s own management will run the day-to-day business, as this retention of management post transaction will maintain operational continuity. Our Company’s management will be responsible for overseeing how the subsidiaries are run and assisting their management as needed.
 
Our Company is seeking opportunities in mature private companies that are in transition or growth mode.
 
We have begun sourcing opportunities through several third-party organizations. Transactions will be subject to industry standard due-diligence requirements. Of course, no two acquisitions are the same, so the due diligence process will vary from one situation to the next. In general, however, there are up to five types of due diligence; (i) Business; (ii) Accounting; (iii) Legal; (iv) Valuation and (v) Environmental, that will need to be completed as part of the process for any proposed transaction.

Proposed Acquisition
 
Using this new strategy, on December 9, 2021 we executed a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with a Singapore based holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged principally in foreign exchange remittance services. Under the MOU, our Company desires to acquire 100% of the Singapore based company for a purchase price of $80,000,000, consisting of common and preferred stock totaling $70,000,000 and subordinated debt of $10,000,000. The proposed acquisition is subject to due diligence customary to transactions of this type and we are currently conducting such due diligence. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement between the parties to the transaction can be reached.
