MicroStrategy 10
MicroStrategy 10 transforms data into business insights through highly visual, interactive reports and dashboards that can be securely distributed to hundreds of thousands of users throughout an enterprise. In MicroStrategy 10.9™, MicroStrategy introduced the Dossier™ feature, which enables users to consolidate reports and dashboards into an easy-to-consume and intuitive analytics book referred to as a dossier. With dossiers, users can utilize built-in collaboration capabilities, tables of contents, powerful filtering options, and proactive alerts and push notifications on top of existing reports and dashboards. 
 Five key business needs have driven demand for powerful analytics solutions:
  
• | Increased consumption of analytics. In the past, dissemination of information was limited to a few power-users or analysts. Now, a wide range of information users – from customer service representatives to the CEO within a company, and from customers to suppliers outside the organization – can benefit from the insight that analytics provides. The wide acceptance of the Internet as an information source also has fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the web to tens of thousands of users across an enterprise. In addition, demand for analytics on mobile devices is being driven by the growth of the mobile Internet and by the accelerating proliferation of mobile devices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased data scalability. Increasing information generation, and in particular, the ability to capture and store electronically every business transaction and interaction, have made terabyte-size data warehouses commonplace. Due to very large data volumes at some organizations, such as data volumes generated by social media, data warehouses can now reach sizes in excess of tens of petabytes (1,000 terabytes). While transaction- and interaction-level information is now routinely captured, organizations often struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores. Organizations need to view data within its operational context – making even the most detailed information meaningful to business users. As a result, users want the ability to easily discover trends hidden in these very large databases and to verify these trends by reviewing the underlying detail. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved analytics system performance. The increase in user population sizes and data volumes puts a strain on analytics infrastructures. Business users expect to retrieve the information they are requesting within seconds of making the request. Mobile devices have set this expectation even higher by increasing demand for near instantaneous responses to requests. Analytics administrators need to systematically monitor and tune the analytics environment to provide the expected service levels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved data comprehension and visualization. As data volumes have increased, the growing work demands placed on business users have meant progressively less time available to users to monitor and improve their businesses and make informed decisions. As a result, business users need to view the data in a summarized, easy-to-grasp format and navigate to areas of concern for additional insight. Presenting the data in a highly visual, accessible, and interactive format to collate, view, and explore information with agility and ease of use improves the overall comprehension of the business and speeds up the decision-making process. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased demand for personalized, one-to-one customer and/or supplier experience. Many companies have implemented strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and/or supplier based on individual needs and preferences. They earn loyalty by providing superior service, security, and convenience. In order to successfully acquire, retain, and upgrade customers, these organizations need to understand their customers’ profiles, transaction histories, past responses to marketing campaigns, and interactions with customer service. This information is often stored in widely dispersed and complex data sources, and obtaining a holistic view of the customer can be challenging.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The volume of data available to enterprises is growing at a very high rate, being driven by greater transaction detail, more sensors, more external data, and more data from mobile and social media platforms. MicroStrategy 10 helps organizations worldwide take advantage of this explosive growth in enterprise data by equipping managers and employees with timely, actionable information to make data-driven business decisions.

Solutions built on MicroStrategy 10 can give analysts, managers, and executives the critical insight they need to reduce costs, better allocate resources, improve efficiencies, and optimize operations. MicroStrategy 10 can also be used to build stronger relationships with business partners and suppliers by providing insights for managing inventory levels, analyzing supply chains, and tracking vendor performance. MicroStrategy 10 also includes predictive capabilities that enable organizations to leverage their historical data to project future business outcomes.
 MicroStrategy 10 provides IT professionals with a powerful, highly automated mechanism for delivering insightful reports and dashboards to employees throughout an organization.  In addition, MicroStrategy 10 offers self-service capabilities, which enable business users to upload, prepare, and explore enterprise data on their own, without any coding or IT expertise.  With these self-service capabilities, business users can spot trends and outliers in a completely visual and interactive way, thereby eliminating much of the need for IT to create reports and dashboards for them.
 MicroStrategy 10 is available in two distinct end user products: MicroStrategy Analytics and MicroStrategy Desktop. MicroStrategy Analytics is designed for enterprise-scale business intelligence, supporting high performance analytics on gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes of data.  Organizations can deploy MicroStrategy Analytics on-premise or access the same functionality within the MicroStrategy on AWS or MicroStrategy Cloud offerings. MicroStrategy Desktop puts the power of MicroStrategy 10 into the hands of individual users for self-service visual analytics and data discovery.  The two products share a common user experience — making it easy to start small with self-service analytics and grow into the production-grade features of MicroStrategy Analytics.

 MicroStrategy’s Metadata Architecture 
The core differentiator of our platform stems from its metadata-based centralized architecture, which has been built and refined over many years and provides access to enterprise data using familiar business terms, rules, and logic. The portable, flexible, reusable, object-oriented and dynamic nature of the metadata provides an efficient BI application and mobile app development platform while maximizing maintainability and enforcing enterprise-wide consistency. The dynamic behavior of metadata in our platform helps ensure consistency across business definitions, and minimizes the number of objects created, stored, and managed.  Other BI technologies are limited in their reuse capabilities, forcing developers to create the same components over and over again for use in each individual report or dashboard.
 MicroStrategy Server 
 MicroStrategy Server is the architectural foundation of MicroStrategy 10. It provides the core analytical processing and job management for all reporting, analysis, and monitoring applications. It provides a powerful, comprehensive set of features necessary for a scalable, fault-tolerant, enterprise-wide business intelligence system.

 Usher
 Usher is a digital credential and identity intelligence offering that provides a highly secure, convenient way for organizations to dematerialize traditional forms of identity verification (such as passwords, tokens, and physical badges) and replace them with unique mobile identity badges, each cryptographically linked to its owner’s smartphone and dynamically linked to the enterprise’s existing identity repositories. Usher can be used as a powerful enterprise productivity and workforce management resource because it is designed to enable managers to gain an almost real-time window into the location and activity of their distributed workforces, while providing powerful interactive features to manage or direct them. With the addition of Usher Professional, administrators can track user activity on a nearly real-time map using access telemetry.  They can also engage in two-way communications with users from the Usher application.  Usher badges work on standard smartphones running on iOS or the Android platform and include an Apple Watch integration.  Through the use of Bluetooth, QR codes, biometrics, push notifications, time-limited PIN codes, and other authentication methods, Usher users can log into applications, VPNs, and workstations, unlock doors and other physical gateways, and validate each other’s identities.  By delivering strong, multi-factor authentication that can be extended to nearly every corporate system, Usher’s digital credential solution addresses some of the biggest challenges facing corporations today, including authentication, identity and access management, and resource authorization, while applying industry leading business intelligence and analytics to an enterprise’s infrastructure. Usher is available both as on-premise software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud.
 Usher can appeal to businesses, universities, associations, governments, and other organizations because it adds a layer of security to their systems, physical spaces, and transactions that would otherwise be technically difficult or cost-prohibitive. Usher is designed to secure an enterprise by offering an alternative to existing forms of identification and authentication.  Usher is designed to provide a more secure alternative to passwords, which can be stolen or cracked.  Usher is also designed to help reduce identity-related fraud by replacing physical ID cards that can be counterfeited and stolen.

We utilize our deep expertise, thought leadership, and extensive MicroStrategy resources to guide our customers in defining, developing, and delivering core business analytics solutions for their enterprises. These solutions provide our customers with greater access to critical business information and help them make better business decisions faster.  MicroStrategy consultants work with the backing of the MicroStrategy product engineering, technical support and account teams to continue to partner with customers to help ensure a high adoption rate, positive ROI, and increased BI maturity.

Currently, the program is available in nine languages in over 40 cities worldwide and online.
 Quarterly updated educational content.  We update educational content to reflect our quarterly software releases, customer feedback and best practices to help ensure users are learning how to leverage the latest MicroStrategy features and functionalities. As our platform evolves, we continuously improve our suite of courses and certifications so users have access to the latest information.

MicroStrategy Technical Support
 MicroStrategy Technical Support is focused on improving the overall customer experience through proactive technical product support for customers and business partners across MicroStrategy’s software products.  Additionally, it is responsible for negotiating and maintaining support contracts with our customers and business partners alike, including support services for MicroStrategy Cloud customers.

It also helps answer questions from customers while working with those customers on renewing their maintenance contracts. The team also works with customers quarterly to ascertain the customer’s on-going satisfaction level.
 Sales and Services Strategy
We primarily sell through our dedicated sales force, as well as through channel partners in order to increase market coverage in both domestic and international markets.  We provide financial incentives for our channel partners to market and distribute our products and services.  We also offer a comprehensive set of educational programs that enhance our potential customers’ and channel partners’ understanding of our software.  Furthermore, we offer a wide range of services that provide support in the discovery, planning, development, and deployment stages of a MicroStrategy product or service.
 Dedicated sales force.  We market our software and services chiefly through our direct sales force.  We have sales offices in locations throughout the world.  We use distributors in several countries where we do not have sales offices.
 Channel partners.  We have established strategic alliances with third party vendors to help ensure the success of our customers’ business intelligence initiatives. Our channel partners are system integrators, consulting firms, resellers, solution providers, managed service providers, OEMs, and technology companies. These firms utilize MicroStrategy platforms for a variety of commercial purposes and our agreements with them generally provide non-exclusive rights to market our products and services and allow access to our marketing materials, product training, and direct sales force for field-level assistance.
 We make significant commitments to our channel partners, including investments in joint development including technical training and certifications, pre-sales and sales enablement, and marketing programs. Through our joint efforts, we believe customers are able to minimize their risk and maximize the return on their business intelligence projects. We believe that our channel partners allow us to leverage sales and service resources, as well as marketing and industry-specific expertise, to expand our user base and increase our market coverage.

 Each quarter in 2017, we hosted symposia events in cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. These events offered IT and business users an opportunity to network, attend workshops, and learn about real-world MicroStrategy 10 applications from our customers. These events also featured topics on analytics and mobile applications in retail, banking, higher education, healthcare and other sectors being transformed by Big Data. We will continue to host symposia events where we will highlight opportunities to drive the adoption of business intelligence across organizations, reduce costs through tool consolidation, and empower the workforce to be more productive – all of which can help attendees plan and achieve their analytics goals.
 Customers
 Our customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries, as well as the public sector. These industries include retail, consulting, technology, manufacturing, finance, banking, insurance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and many more.
 Competition
MicroStrategy Analytics, MicroStrategy on AWS and MicroStrategy Cloud Competitors
 The analytics market is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology paradigms.  Within the analytics space, we compete with many different vendors, including (i) large software vendors, such as IBM (Cognos), SAP (BO), Microsoft (Power BI™), and Oracle (OBIEE), that provide one or more products that directly compete with our products, (ii) open source analytics vendors such as OpenText™ Analytics and Hitachi (Pentaho®), (iii) various other analytics software providers, such as Qlik™, Tableau Software®, TIBCO®, Information Builders®, and the SAS Institute, and (iv) other vendors offering cloud-based offerings, such as GoodData and Birst, an Infor Company. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate and compete with these vendors and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes.  Failure to maintain adequate technology differentiation from these competitors could materially adversely affect our revenue from both existing and prospective customers.
 22


MicroStrategy Mobile Competitors 
 The market for mobile analytics is rapidly evolving. New mobile devices are being introduced in the market at a rapid pace, and enhancements to mobile operating systems are being made at an even faster rate. The rapidly changing technology landscape creates opportunities for both existing competitors and new vendors to introduce innovative new products. Within the mobile analytics space, we predominantly compete with the same set of analytics vendors that we compete with in the analytics market. Our competitiveness in this market will depend on how quickly we can adapt to the changing technology landscape and how effectively we sell, market, and differentiate our offering.
Usher Competitors 
 Usher competes with companies with technologies categorized as user authentication products. These competitors focus primarily on traditional forms of identity verification such as smart cards, tokens, and password managers.  These companies have significant name recognition and offer solutions with security architectures that are familiar to IT buyers.  Usher also competes with companies with newer solutions, often involving mobile technology.

Research and Product Development
