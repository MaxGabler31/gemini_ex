ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. is a world leader in deep-ocean exploration. The discovery, development and extraction of deep-ocean minerals is the companys core focus. Our innovative techniques are also applied to shipwreck cargo recovery and other marine survey and exploration charter services. We have numerous projects in various stages of development around the world from both our own portfolio as well as through third-party contracts. 
 We have extensive experience discovering shipwreck sites in the deep ocean and conducting archaeological excavations with remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). We have worked on some of the most historically important shipwreck projects to be discovered including the SS Republic, HMS Victory (1744), the SS Central America and La Marquis de Tourny. Odyssey also has considerable experience conducting cargo recovery operations from 20th century shipwrecks in the deep ocean. Between 2012 and 2013, we recovered over 110 tons of silver cargo, representing 99% of the insured cargo, from the SS Gairsoppa, which was located nearly three miles deep. This was one of the largest and heaviest recoveries from a shipwreck in history. Odyssey is the exclusive provider of shipwreck search and recovery services for Magellan Offshore Services (Magellan). Odyssey also performs marine services for other customers, including private clients and governments. 
 In 2010, we began to leverage our core business expertise and technology for deep-ocean mineral exploration. Our expeditions conducted for Neptune Minerals, Inc. and Chatham Rock Phosphate, Ltd. resulted in the assessment of significant mineral deposits. We are also developing and exploring our own deep-ocean mineral projects. Through our majority stake in Oceanica Resources S. de. R.L., a Panamanian company (Oceanica), we control Exploraciones Oceanicas, S. De R.L. De C.V. (ExO), a Mexican company that has exclusive mining permits for an area known as the Don Diego deposit that contains large amounts of mineralized phosphate material. Our team performed all of the off-shore exploration to find and validate the mineralized phosphate deposit and is managing the environmental studies and environmental permit application process with ExO. The phosphate deposit is one of the largest to be identified and is expected to be important to the regional and international fertilizer markets and is strategically important to Mexico and North America. 
Deep-Ocean Mineral Exploration 
 Our mineral exploration and development program leverages the 20+ years experience we have mapping the ocean floor in search of shipwrecks. The technology and team was seamlessly applied to successfully locate mineral deposits on the ocean floor worldwide. Our expert team boasts some of the industrys most experienced ocean explorers and geologists utilizing an extensive array of advanced deep-ocean technology resulting in the cost-efficient exploration and assessment of seabed minerals.

Our capabilities allow us to perform precision geophysical and geotechnical surveys, detailed mapping, sampling, environmental assessments and resource evaluations. 
 We offer exploration services, including geophysical and geotechnical assessments of seabed mineral deposits, to companies, including our subsidiaries and companies in which we hold an equity position, as a resource development partner. When performing mineral exploration services, we may receive payments in the form of cash for services, equity interests in the contracting company, or financial interests in the tenement. 
 There are three economically significant types of seabed mineral deposits being evaluated or explored by Odyssey: 
 Phosphorites - Phosphorite deposits are mineral occurrences that are recovered primarily for their phosphate material. Phosphorites may be present on the seabed or in the stratigraphic column. Phosphate is an agriculturally important mineral used primarily for crop fertilization, though a variety of uses exist for phosphate and phosphorus, the significant element in phosphate. Phosphorites exist in a wide range of depositional environments. Several factors contribute to the formation of phosphorites, including a supply of phosphorus, present or pre-existing complex oceanographic circulation patterns, and a proper sedimentological setting. Generally, phosphorites are targeted on continental shelves and slopes, though phosphorites do occur on oceanic seabed features such as guyots (flat-topped seamounts). 
 Polymetallic nodules - These nodular concretions are found on the seabed and consist of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides. Nodules generally consist primarily of either manganese or iron. Manganese nodules can contain up to 30% manganese as well as other valuable metals and minerals, while iron nodules generally contain a mixture of iron, silicon, and aluminum ore. Polymetallic nodules are found at the seabed interface in oceans worldwide. Nodules must exhibit proper metal content and exist in sufficient concentration to be of potential economic interest. Some areas hosting economically viable nodules include the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone between Hawaii and Mexico, the Peru Basin, and the northern Indian Ocean. 
 Seafloor Massive Sulphides (SMS)  SMS deposits are found on the ocean floor and contain copper, zinc, gold, silver and other trace metals. SMS deposits are found in areas of active or complex tectonic or volcanogenic activity, such as near oceanic spreading centers (such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise), back-arc basins (such as the Manus Basin in Papua New Guinea waters) and submarine arc volcanic chains (such as Kermadec Arc in New Zealand waters). 
 Deep-Ocean Shipwreck Exploration 
 During the past 20 years, we amassed a large private database and research library of target shipwrecks, developed and acquired proprietary deep-ocean equipment and tools, and built a team of knowledgeable experts to execute off-shore projects. Over that time, we conducted shipwreck search and cargo recovery work on our own behalf and under contract to third parties. On December 10, 2015, we sold the shipwreck database and research library to Monaco Financial LLCs affiliate Magellan while still retaining our equipment, tools, and specialized offshore team members. As part of the Acquisition Agreement with Monaco, Magellan agreed to exclusively hire Odyssey on a cost plus basis for any shipwreck search and recovery projects conducted through 2020 with the option to extend the contract. Magellan will also pay us 21.25% of the net proceeds from any monetization of recovered cargo. As part of the Acquisition Agreement, four pre-existing projects, including the HMS Victory (1744) and HMS Sussex, were retained by us. Magellan may participate in funding the recovery costs of these projects in the future. If funding is provided, Magellan will have the right to receive up to 50% of our net proceeds, if any. 
 We have extensive experience and abilities in key functional areas required for success in the shipwreck business, such as research, conservation, documentation and exhibit of rare artifacts and publication of archaeological excavation. We expect to conduct these services under contract to Magellan or its affiliates for their projects as well. 
 Offshore Services 
 We own specialized marine services survey and recovery equipment that we mobilize for customers on owned or leased vessels. This proprietary equipment is operated by our technical team when conducting operations worldwide. This allowed us to launch the CLIO Offshore services program, increasing the utilization and leverage of the technical team and assets between our projects. CLIO Offshore is focused on third-party survey, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and recovery projects down to 6,000 meters in depth. This program also offers services for deep-ocean resource explorations, ship and airplane wreck explorations, archaeological recovery and conservation and insurance documentation.

Operational Projects and Status 
 We have numerous deep-ocean projects in various stages of development around the world. In order to protect the targets of our planned search or recovery operations, in some cases we may defer disclosing specific information relating to our projects until we have located a shipwreck or other potentially valuable sources of interest and determined a course of action to protect our property rights. With respect to mineral deposits, SEC Industry Guide 7 outlines the Securities and Commissions basic mining disclosure policy and what information may be disclosed in public filings. With respect to shipwrecks, the identity of the ship may be indeterminable and the nature and amount of cargo may be uncertain, thus before completing any recovery, specific information about the project may be unavailable. If work is conducted on behalf of a client, release of information may be limited by the client. Although Odyssey has a variety of projects in various stages of development, only projects with operational activity in the past 12 months are included below. 
Subsea Mineral Mining Exploration Projects 
 Oceanica Resources, S. de R.L. 
 In February 2013, we disclosed Odysseys ownership interest, through Odyssey Marine Enterprises, Ltd., a wholly owned Bahamian company (Enterprises), in Oceanica Resources, S. de R.L., a Panamanian company (Oceanica), and Exploraciones Oceanicas, S. De R.L. De C.V. (ExO), a subsidiary of Oceanica. ExO is in the business of mineral exploration and controls exclusive permits in an area in Mexican waters that contains a large amount of phosphate mineralized material (known as the Don Diego deposit). Phosphate is a key ingredient of fertilizers. In March 2014, Odyssey completed a first NI 43-101 compliant report on the deposit and periodically updates this report. The Don Diego deposit is currently our main mineral project, and success of this project is important to Odysseys future. Odyssey believes that the Don Diego deposit contains a large amount of high-grade phosphate rock that can be extracted on a financially attractive basis (essentially a dredging operation) and that the product will be attractive to Mexican and other world producers of fertilizers. 
 ExO has conducted extensive scientific testing of the mineralized phosphate material and of the environmental impact of recovering the mineralized material from the seafloor. ExO has been working with leading environmental experts on the impact assessment and permitting process, with Royal Boskalis Westminster N.V on the extraction and processing program, and with JPMorgan and the AHMSA group of companies on the strategic growth alternatives. 
 ExO applied for and was granted additional mining concession areas by the Mexican government. These additional areas are adjacent to the zones with the highest concentration of mineralization in the original mining concession area. ExO also relinquished certain parts of the granted concession areas where the mineral concentration levels were less attractive for mining purposes. 
 In September 2014, ExO reported that the EIA for proposed dredging and recovery of phosphate sands from the Don Diego deposit had been filed with the Mexican Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). Approval of this EIA application is needed in order to obtain an environmental permit to begin the commercial extraction of phosphate from the tenement area. In November 2014, SEMARNAT held a public hearing on the EIA in Mexico and asked supplemental questions to Oceanica on its EIA application. In full compliance with the SEMARNAT process, a response to the questions was filed in March 2015. In addition to providing supplemental scientific information and studies, the response included additional mitigation and economic considerations to reinforce ExOs commitment to being good corporate citizens and stewards of the environment. In June 2015, ExO withdrew its EIA application to allow additional time for review and regional briefings. The EIA was re-submitted in June 2015, and additional information was filed in August 2015. A public hearing on this application was conducted by SEMARNAT on October 8, 2015, additional questions were received from SEMARNAT in November 2015, and ExOs responses to the questions were filed with SEMARNAT on December 3, 2015. On April 8, 2016, SEMARNAT denied the application for this environmental license as presented. On March 21, 2018, the Superior Court of the Federal Court of Administrative Justice in Mexico ruled unanimously in favor of our subsidiary, ExO, nullifying the April 2016 denial of the environmental license application for the extraction of phosphate sand from the Don Diego deposit. To move to the next phase of development of the deposit, we need the approval of this environmental permit application. 
 Enterprises initially held 77.6 million of Oceanicas 100.0 million outstanding shares. Subsequently, Enterprises sold and transferred to Mako Resources, LLC (Mako) 15.0 million shares for a purchase price of $1.00 per share, or $15.0 million, and granted Mako options to purchase an additional 15.0 million shares at the purchase price of $2.50 per share before December 31, 2013.

In June 2013, Mako agreed to exercise a portion of these options to purchase 8.0 million shares at a reduced exercise price of $1.25 per share. As part of Odysseys strategy to maintain a control position in Oceanica, in parallel with the early exercise, Enterprises purchased 1.0 million shares of Oceanica from another Oceanica shareholder at $1.25 per share. This transaction also provided Odyssey voting rights on an additional 3.0 million shares of Oceanica held by such other Oceanica shareholder so long as there is no change in control of Odyssey. 
 An option to purchase an additional 1.0 million shares was exercised by Mako on December 30, 2013 for a total amount of $2.5 million. The options on the remaining 6.0 million shares were extended in 2014 and 2015. On March 11, 2015, these options were terminated in exchange for the issuance of 4.0 million shares of our common stock to Mako. In August 2014, we entered into a loan agreement with Monaco Financial, LLC, a marketing partner. Under terms of that agreement, Monaco may convert all or part of the loan balance into Oceanica shares held by us to purchase Oceanica shares from us at a pre-defined price (See NOTE I). This loan was amended on December 10, 2015 and again in March 2016, extending the maturity date of the loan to April 1, 2018 and allowing Monaco to retain the call option on the $10 million worth of Oceanica shares held by Odyssey until April 1, 2018. In March 2015, Odyssey entered into a loan arrangement with Minera del Norte, S.A. de C.V. (MINOSA) whereby Odyssey pledged all of its shares in Oceanica as collateral for a $14.75 million loan from MINOSA. The MINOSA loan has been amended several times and matured December 31, 2017, coupled with other stipulations, see NOTE I in ITEM 8 for further information. 
 Shipwreck Exploration Projects 
 Odyssey began conducting offshore services for our shipwreck business partner, Magellan Offshore Services, in 2016. In 2017 the search and inspection phase of a major shipwreck project covering multiple valuable targets was successfully completed. Recovery operations are currently underway on this project. The master services agreement governing this project states Odyssey will be paid cost plus a specified mark-up and Odyssey will receive 21.25% of net returns, if any, from this project. 
 Other Projects 
 Odyssey offers its marine exploration services to third party companies. This may be for mineral exploration, environmental studies, shipwreck search and recovery, subsea surveys, and other off-shore work requiring specialized vessels, equipment and personnel. 
 Legal and Political Issues 
 Odyssey works with a number of leading international maritime lawyers and policy experts to constantly monitor international legal initiatives that might affect our projects. 
 To the extent that we engage in mineral exploration or shipwreck search and recovery activities in the territorial, contiguous or exclusive economic zones of countries, Odyssey works to comply with verifiable applicable regulations and treaties. 
 We believe there will be increased interest in the protection of underwater cultural heritage throughout the oceans of the world. We are uniquely qualified to provide governments and international agencies with knowledge and skills to help manage these resources. 
 Related to mineral exploration, we will evaluate the political climate and specific legal requirements of any areas in which we are working. We may partner with third parties who have unique industry experience in specific geographical areas to assist with navigation of the regulatory landscape. 
 Competition 
 Odyssey conducts mineral exploration on both shallow and deep-sea terrains. There are a number of companies that publicly identify themselves as engaged in aspects of deep-ocean mineral exploration or mining, including Nautilus Minerals (NUS.TO), Neptune Minerals, Deep Green Resources, Inc. and Chatham Rock Phosphate, Ltd. (CRP.NZ) as well as countries that are exploring options to mine deep-ocean mineralized materials. As our mineral exploration business plan 
 
4 
 
 includes partnering with others in the industry, we view these entities as potential partners rather than pure competitors. As mineral rights are generally granted on an exclusive basis for a specific area or tenement, once licenses are granted we do not anticipate any competitive intrusion on those areas. It is possible that one of these companies or some currently unknown group may secure licenses on an area desired by Odyssey or one of our partners; but since exploration work does not start until licenses are secured, we do not believe that competition from one or more of these entities, known or unknown, would materially affect our operating plan or alter our current business strategy. For offshore mineral exploration, there are providers of vessels and equipment that could be competitors or partners for certain projects. These include companies such as Fugro NV and Royal Boskalis Westminster N.V. 
 Odyssey shipwreck recovery projects are focused on deep-sea sites where competition is limited due to the expertise and specialized equipment needed to operate at such depths. There are a number of companies that publicly identify themselves as engaged in aspects of the shipwreck business, but they do not compete directly with us as an established deep-ocean archaeological shipwreck exploration company. These entities include, but are not limited to, Blue Water Ventures, Blue Water Recoveries, Britannias Gold, Ocean Infinity, Mel Fishers Treasures, Deep Blue Marine, Marine Exploration, Inc., Oceanic Research and Recovery, Seafarer Exploration, Sub Sea Research, Earth Dragon Resources, Endurance Exploration Group and UnderSea Recovery Corporation. Some companies, such as Swire Seabed, Phoenix International Holdings Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc. may provide deep-sea services to groups seeking to pursue deep sea projects. It is possible that one of these companies or some currently unknown group may locate and recover a shipwreck on our project roster; however, we do not believe that competition from one or more of these entities, known or unknown, would materially affect our operating plan or alter our current business strategy. 
 Cost of Environmental Compliance 
 With the exception of marine operations, our general business operations do not expose us to environmental risks or hazards. We carry insurance that provides a layer of protection in the event of an environmental exposure resulting from the operation of vessels we may utilize. The cost of such coverage is minimal on an annual basis. Our seabed mineral business is currently in the exploration and validation phase and has thus not exposed us to environmental risks or hazards.
