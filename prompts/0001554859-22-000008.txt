ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
General

We are a company providing technology solutions to improve the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare providers. Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services that assist our customers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. Our patented and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared product, QuantaFlo, measures arterial blood flow in the extremities to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD. In April 2021, we entered into an agreement with a private company to exclusively market and distribute Insulin Insights, an FDA-cleared software product that recommends optimal insulin dosing for diabetic patients in the United States, including Puerto Rico, except for selected accounts. We made investments in this private software company and in another private company whose product, Discern, is a test for early Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to develop additional complementary proprietary products in-house, and seek out other arrangements for additional products and services that we believe will bring value to our customers and to our company. We believe our current products and services, and any future products or services that we may offer, position us to provide valuable information to our customer base, which in turn permits them to better guide patient care.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total revenues of $53.0 million and net income of $17.2 million compared to total revenues of $38.6 million and net income of $14.0 million in 2020. 
COVID-19 Update
Late in the first quarter and into the second quarter of 2020, we experienced decreased test volumes due to COVID-19 related “social distancing” and other executive orders mandating “shelter-in-place” or similar restrictions. These governmental restrictions limited patient visits by our customers, and restricted participation in trade shows and in-person training. When such restrictions were initially lifted around the country and non-emergency medical services resumed in late 2020, our business returned to and even exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels. However, sales personnel continued to be limited in ability to attend trade shows and conduct in-person training through early 2021. 
​
Notwithstanding these limitations, variable fee license revenues (that is, fee-per-test) rebounded strongly in the first half of 2021 from the effects of the ongoing COVID-19, but decreased sequentially in the second half of 2021. We believe variable fee license revenues experienced a COVID-19 related timing change in the behavior of insurance plans when ordering QuantaFlo testing from our health risk assessment customers. We believe this new pattern of testing earlier in the year and the effect on variable fee license revenues may not continue in 2022 or even beyond 2022. However, in January 2022 compared to December 2021, fixed-fee monthly license revenues increased by approximately 1% while variable fee license revenues (i.e., fee-per-test) increased by approximately 87%. Comparing January 2022 to January 2021, fixed-fee monthly license revenues increased by approximately 13%, while variable fee license revenues increased by approximately 6%. All numbers for January 2022 are preliminary and unaudited. 
​
As we look forward into 2022, there is continued uncertainty as outbreaks of variants continue to occur and vaccination rates lag in certain jurisdictions. New, additional or different restrictions could be imposed, which could impact the usage of our product by our customers or further impact timing of demand for our products.
Our Products and Services
We currently market a patented and FDA-cleared, vascular testing product, QuantaFlo, to our customers, who include insurance plans, physician groups and risk assessment groups. We also have an exclusive distribution arrangement for the United States, including Puerto Rico, to distribute Insulin Insights, an FDA-cleared, software solution designed to provide insulin dosing recommendations to clinicians for the adjustment and maintenance of blood

glucose levels in insulin-dependent patients with Type 2 diabetes. We believe this product will be attractive to our existing customers as well as help expand our customer base.
QuantaFlo
QuantaFlo is a four-minute in-office blood flow test. Healthcare providers can use blood flow measurements as part of their examinations of a patient’s vascular condition, including assessments of patients who have vascular disease. The following diagram illustrates the use of QuantaFlo:

QuantaFlo features a sensor clamp that is placed on the toe or finger much like current pulse oximetry devices. Infrared light emitted from the clamp on the dorsal surface of the digit is scattered and reflected by the red blood cells coursing through the area of illumination. Returning light is ‘sensed’ by the sensor. A blood flow waveform is instantaneously constructed by our proprietary software algorithm. Both index fingers and both large toes are interrogated, which takes about 30 seconds for each. A hardcopy report form is generated that displays four waveforms and the ratio of each leg measurement compared with the arms. Results are classified as Flow Obstruction or No Flow Obstruction.
We have primarily developed a license model rather than an outright sales model for QuantaFlo. This license model eliminates the need to make a capital equipment sale. Consequently, we generally require no down payment or long-term commitment from our customers. QuantaFlo has an expected average lifetime of at least three years. We intend to reevaluate the monthly price periodically in consideration of the revenue generation associated with QuantaFlo. To date, we roughly estimate that routine office usage of the QuantaFlo has ranged from a few tests per week up to 10 tests per day. We also offer contracts in which we invoice on a per test basis for use of QuantaFlo. Approximately 59% of our customers are on the fixed-fee software licensing model, whereas 41% are on the variable fee model based on usage.
We have placed our QuantaFlo product with healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups and companies contracting with the healthcare industry such as risk assessment groups, in addition to doctors’ offices. Our largest customer is a U.S. diversified healthcare company and its affiliated plans, and in the year ended December 31, 2021, it accounted for 40.8% of our revenues compared to 47.2% in the prior year.

Other Blood Flow Testing Methods
Blood flow is the amount of blood delivered to a given region per unit time, whereas blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of arteries. Given a fixed resistance, blood flow and blood pressure are proportional. The traditional ankle brachial index, or ABI, with Doppler test uses a blood pressure cuff to measure the systolic blood pressure in the lower legs and in the arms. A blood pressure cuff is inflated proximal to the artery in question. Using a Doppler device, the inflation continues until the pulse in the artery ceases. The blood pressure cuff is then slowly deflated. When the artery’s pulse is re-detected through the Doppler probe the pressure in the cuff at that moment indicates the systolic pressure of that artery. The test is repeated on all four extremities. Well-established criteria for the ratio of the blood pressure in a leg compared to the blood pressure in the arms are used to assess the presence or absence of flow obstruction. Generally, these tests take 15 minutes to perform and require a vascular technician to be done properly. Like QuantaFlo, the traditional analog ABI test with Doppler is a non-invasive physiologic measurement that may be abnormal in the presence of PAD. Alternatively, primary care physicians may palpate the pedal pulses to assess blood flow in the lower extremities. However, pulse palpation is generally not sensitive for the detection of vascular disease. Other options to detect arterial obstructions are imaging systems that use ultrasound, x-ray technology or magnetic resonance to obtain anatomic information about blood vessels in the legs. However, as compared to QuantaFlo, imaging tests are much more expensive and are performed by specialists in special laboratories or offices.
Insulin Insights
​
Insulin Insights is a software program that is used by a healthcare provider to optimize out-patient insulin dosing. Following our October 2020 minority investment in its owner, in April 2021, we entered into an agreement to exclusively market and distribute this software program in the United States, including Puerto Rico, except for selected accounts. Under this agreement, we pre-paid for $2.0 million of licenses, and signed our first customer to a license in September 2021. Unless early terminated in accordance with its terms, the exclusive distribution agreement will remain in full force and effect until April 1, 2026, and thereafter there is an option for this agreement to be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. 
​
We currently intend to distribute Insulin Insights using a software as a service, or SAAS, license model rather than an outright sales model for Insulin Insights based on a per patient per month fee. We generally require no down payment or long-term commitment from our customers. We intend to reevaluate the price periodically. As we only recently began distributing licenses, to date, we do not have enough experience with the product to be able estimate routine usage of Insulin Insights in terms of patients per office.
We will seek to distribute Insulin Insights to healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups, and companies that contract with the healthcare industry, such as risk assessment groups, long-term care, or remote patient monitoring organizations, in addition to doctors’ offices. We believe that this software product will be of interest to our existing customer base, as well as help us to expand interest in QuantaFlo to additional customers. 
​
Market Opportunity
 ​
QuantaFlo
Fee-for-service is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. In health care, it gives an incentive for physicians to provide more treatments because payment is dependent on the quantity of care, rather than quality of care. Capitation is a payment arrangement that pays a physician or group of physicians a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected healthcare utilization of that patient, with greater payment for patients with significant medical history. For Medicare Advantage patients, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, pays a fee per patient, also known as capitation. CMS uses risk adjustment to adjust capitation payments to health plans, either higher or lower, to account for the differences in expected health costs of individuals. Accordingly, under CMS guidelines, risk factor adjustments per patient will provide payment that is higher for sicker patients who have conditions that are 

6



codified. Accordingly, there is a financial incentive to identify those Medicare Advantage patients that are sicker, including those that have undiagnosed ailments such as PAD. 
​
The coding system used by CMS for the Medicare Advantage program is a hierarchical condition category, or HCC, diagnostic classification system that begins by classifying over 14,000 diagnosis codes into 805 diagnostic groups, or DXGs. Each code maps to exactly one DXG, which represents a well-specified medical condition, such as DXG 96.01 pre-cerebral or cerebral arterial occlusion with infarction. DXGs are further aggregated into 189 condition categories, or CCs. CCs describe a broader set of similar diseases. Diseases within a CC are related clinically and with respect to cost. An example is CC96 Ischemic or Unspecified Stroke, which includes DXGs 96.01 and 96.02 acute but ill-defined cerebrovascular disease. We believe that quality of care measured by completeness and wellness is an economic benefit. These changes are already in place for the approximately 26 million participants in the Medicare Advantage program and are expected to expand to more types of insured patients as healthcare reform is deployed. 

​
Undiagnosed vascular diseases are major under-diagnosed health problems in the United States. These conditions are common and deadly cardiovascular disease that is often undiagnosed. As with clogged arteries in the heart, clogged arteries in the legs place patients at an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Published studies have shown that persons with PAD are four times more likely to die of heart attack, and two to three times more likely to die of stroke. According to a study by P.G. Steg published in the JAMA, patients with PAD have a 21% event rate of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular hospitalization within 12 months. The SAGE Group has estimated that as many as 20 million people are affected with PAD in the United States alone and A.T. Hirsch et al. in a JAMA published article further estimate that only 11% have claudication (pain on exertion), a classic symptom of PAD. 
​
Many people affected with PAD do not have noticeable symptoms. When symptoms of PAD are present, they often include fatigue, heaviness, cramping or pain in the legs during activity, leg or foot pain, sores, wounds or ulcers on the toes, feet, or legs, which are slow to heal, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, or enlarged liver. Persons with PAD may become disabled and not be able to work. 
​
Risk factors for developing PAD include: 
​

• | Age (over 50 years)
--+--------------------

​

• | Race (African-American)
--+------------------------

​

• | History of smoking
--+-------------------

​

• | Diabetes
--+---------

​

• | High blood pressure
--+--------------------

​

• | High blood cholesterol
--+-----------------------

​

• | Personal history of vascular disease, heart attack, or stroke.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe medical personnel who care for those older than 50 years are the target market for QuantaFlo, along with those insurance plans that have a high number of Medicare Advantage patients. Based on U.S. Census data, we believe there are more than 80 million older Americans who could be evaluated for the presence of PAD. 
​
According to the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis, there are over 275,000 medical professionals practicing primary care in the United States. In addition, based on American Heart Association data, there are over 20,000 cardiologists and 7,500 vascular and cardiovascular surgeons. Also, there are millions of diabetic patients seen routinely by endocrinologists. Many podiatrists who see patients with these problems and orthopedic surgeons may see value in screening patients for circulation issues prior to leg procedures. Neurologists may need a tool to differentiate leg pain from vascular versus neurologic etiology. Nephrologists see patients with kidney disease, who have a higher frequency of PAD. Wound care centers need to know the adequacy of limb perfusion. We expect that each physician 

7



will have many patient visits annually from people older than 50 years. While it is standard practice to ask about symptoms of PAD and to look for signs on physical exam, we believe that it is often the case in busy practices that the questions go unasked. 
​
Generally speaking, individual products are not specifically approved by name under a third-party payor code. Physicians who seek reimbursement for PAD testing procedures are likely to use codes that describe non-invasive physiologic testing. We do not track directly how physicians code for and receive payment for such procedures.
 ​
Insulin Insights
​
Of the growing diabetic population in the United States, over a quarter use insulin according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Insulin is a necessary medication as nearly all Type 1 diabetics (approximately 1.6 million people in the United States, and roughly 21% of Type 2 diabetics (of the over 30 million people in the United States with Type 2 diabetics) must also use insulin to bring their blood glucose levels down to a healthy range. Without insulin, patients are likely to suffer from blurred vision, weight loss, and intolerable thirst. Eventually, uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, gangrene, loss of limbs, and ultimately death. Tighter control of glucose is proven to improve the outcomes in diabetes care.
​
In the United States, about 90% of diabetic patients treating with insulin are managed by primary care practitioners. Insulin Insights is designed to be used by such practitioners to recommend optimal insulin dosing for each individual patient.
​
CMS has established a star rating system called the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, or HEDIS. This system rates how a health plan’s Medicare Advantage program performs across the various HEDIS quality measures on a five-star scale. A comprehensive diabetes program is included in the HEDIS measures for members age 18-75 with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2). It specifically measures the percentage of plan members who had an HbA1c test during the year and demonstrate good control (<9.0%). Based on the star ratings, high performing health plans are also eligible to be paid bonuses by CMS. We believe this provides a financial incentive to potential customers for an Insulin Insights software license, as it will assist them in working with their diabetic patients to optimize insulin dosing and achieve better control of their blood glucose levels. 
​
Other Products and Services
In November 2021, we terminated our September 2020 exclusive distribution agreement for its product line in the United States, including Puerto Rico, and are now focusing our efforts on additional products and services that we believe are complementary to our existing offering. 
In addition to our internal research and development efforts, in October 2020, we invested in an additional private company that has developed a product, Discern, a test for early Alzheimer’s disease. We do not have a distribution agreement for Discern.
Strategy
Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market products and services that assist healthcare providers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. We intend to do this by:

● | Targeting customers with patients at risk of developing PAD. Healthcare providers use blood flow measurements as part of their assessment of a patient’s vascular condition. Our strategy is to keep marketing QuantaFlo on a recurrent revenue model to insurance plans and medical personnel who care for those older than 50 years, including cardiologists, internists, nephrologists, endocrinologist, podiatrists, and family practitioners. Specifically, we believe there are more than 400,000 physicians and other potential customers in the United States alone, many of whom care for patients will be more than 50 years old and at increased risk of developing PAD. Based on U.S. Census data, the evaluable patient population for QuantaFlo is estimated to be more than 80 million patients in the United States annually.

● | Expanding the tools available to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts. Our intention is to provide a tool to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts, for whom it was previously impractical to conduct a blood flow measurement unless in a specialized vascular laboratory. For vascular specialists, QuantaFlo does not require the use of blood pressure cuffs (which should not be used on some breast cancer patients), and measures without blood pressure in obese patients and patients with non-compressible, hard, calcified arteries. Currently, these patients often are unable to be measured satisfactorily with traditional analog ABI devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing additional product and service offerings that allow healthcare providers to deliver cost-effective wellness and receive increased compensation for their services. In March 2015, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of our product, QuantaFlo, reflecting several updates and modifications to the original model that were developed in conjunction with our consultant engineering groups. We are also exploring potential new product and service offerings through our research and development programs. These product and service offerings are designed to provide cost-effective wellness solutions for our growing, established customer base. Our goal is to achieve a reputation for outstanding service and the provision of cost-effective wellness solutions, while leveraging our gains in the marketplace for such product and service offerings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring additional product and service offerings through arrangements or potential acquisitions. In addition to our in-house research and development efforts, we are also seeking out opportunities to expand our product and service offerings through marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements, such as our agreement to exclusively market and distribute Insulin Insights line in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Such arrangements will allow us to sell products related to chronic disease management through our network of physicians and other customers. We may also consider opportunistically acquiring additional products if we believe they fit within our strategy.

Sales and Marketing
We provide our QuantaFlo product to our customers through our salespersons and our co-exclusive distributor, Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., or Bard, a large medical device company with a worldwide presence in both interventional cardiology and dialysis, which was acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company in December 2017. Sales through Bard accounted for less than 3% of our revenues in each of 2021 and 2020. In addition to our co-exclusive distributor, we have direct sales and marketing representatives who have experience selling products and services to our anticipated market.
We deliver our vascular testing product directly to our customers, and in-service training to the customers is provided either on-line or in person. Because QuantaFlo is relatively easy to use training can generally be accomplished in less than one day.
Customers who have licensed our QuantaFlo product may pay by credit card or check generally on the 15th of each month as an advance for usage during the next 30 days. In some cases, customers prefer an annual license paid in advance. We provide technical support daily, coupled directly to the manufacturing operation so that replacement products, if needed, can be shipped overnight directly to the customer. The majority of the support is over the telephone and focuses on software and connectivity issues, rather than hardware. We plan to upgrade QuantaFlo operating systems as appropriate by direct shipments.
In addition to the license model with a fixed monthly fee, we also have contracts that charge a variable monthly fee, in which we invoice based on the number of tests performed with QuantaFlo. In addition to licensing the QuantaFlo software, we have sold QuantaFlo equipment and accessories.
In April 2021, we entered into an agreement with Mellitus Health Inc., a private company, to exclusively market and distribute Insulin Insights, a new software product, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, except for selected accounts, and pre-paid for $2.0 million of software licenses. In September 2021, we signed several customers to a license for this product but as of December 31, 2021, we had not generated any material revenues from this product.

Manufacturing
We manufacture our product, QuantaFlo, in the United States through independent contractors whom we pay for finished goods. Our contracts provide for subassemblies, product final assembly, test, serialization, finished goods, inventory and shipping operations. Our current contracts will remain in force until terminated by us upon three months written notice, or until terminated by either party for cause. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our current contract manufacturers, there are many such qualified contract manufacturers available around the country should we need to replace them or if they are not able to meet demand as we grow our business as anticipated. While our current independent contract manufacturers source some supplies from China, we believe QuantaFlo is relatively easy to manufacture, and should we encounter issues due to supply chain disruptions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we believe alternative sources should be available. We employ a consultant vendor qualification expert to monitor and test the quality controls and quality assurance procedures of our contract manufacturer.
Competition
The principal competitor for QuantaFlo is the standard blood pressure cuff ABI device. QuantaFlo does not include a blood pressure cuff. There are several companies that manufacture the traditional ABI device, which range in price from $2,500 to $20,000. Some of these companies are much larger than us and have more financial resources and their own distributor network. The traditional ABI devices are differentiated by the degree of automation designed into each product. ABI devices that rely more heavily on operator assessment (i.e., listening to the return of pulse while decreasing cuff pressure), are thought to have less objectivity in their measurement. Because standard ABI devices require a better trained operator, the products are usually sold to specialized vascular labs that are supervised by a vascular surgeon, with the tests performed by a licensed vascular technician. It is not uncommon for such ABI devices to be marketed to the offices of internists, podiatrists, endocrinologists or most cardiologists.
Our intention is to provide a tool to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts, for whom it was previously impractical to conduct a blood flow measurement unless in a specialized vascular laboratory. For vascular specialists, QuantaFlo does not require the use of blood pressure cuffs (which should not be used on some breast cancer patients), and measures without blood pressure in obese patients and patients with non-compressible, hard, calcified arteries. Currently, these patients often are unable to be measured with traditional analog ABI devices.
Competitors are beginning to market competing digital devices seeking to provide fast results that may be used outside of a specialized vascular laboratory. Given the potential size of the PAD market, we expect competitors to continue to enter the space.
Research and Development Program
We have dedicated engineering consultants that are well integrated into our overall business, ranging from customer requirements to technical support. The engineering group uses our in-house quality system as its framework for new product development and release. The majority of the engineering is circuit design and software development. We are currently developing several updates and modifications to QuantaFlo in conjunction with our consultant engineering groups, as well as exploring potential new product and service offerings. These product and service offerings are being designed to provide cost-effective wellness solutions for our growing, established customer base. The new products and service offerings under development or that may be developed may incorporate some of our current technology or new technology. We are also directing much of our activity to building our trade secrets and protecting proprietary positions.
We have sponsored several studies of our blood flow measurement products or provided data to authors on the use of our products for review and publication. One of these studies, the results of which were compiled in 2012 and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2013, sought to determine the frequency of finding undiscovered vascular disease in primary care practices using our vascular testing product. In the study of 632 patients at 19 office practices, the frequency of flow obstruction was 12% and of these patients, 75% did not have classic symptoms of PAD. Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned the study’s retrospective design, no direct comparison to other vascular tests and passive data collection such that 8% of patients had one or more missing data fields.

10



Another study we sponsored was designed to assess the side-by-side performance of our vascular testing product compared with traditional analog ABI with Doppler measurements in medical practices. In the study of 181 limbs from 121 patients at 5 medical practices during 2012 and 2013, three techniques were used on all limbs: our test, traditional analog ABI with Doppler, and Duplex ultrasound imaging as a gold standard. Traditional analog ABI with Doppler was unable to perform a conclusive study in 8.7% of limbs. In the remaining limbs, our vascular testing product and the ABI with Doppler measurements were in agreement, or in other words concordant, in 78% of limbs. Among the discordant limbs, Duplex imaging judged that the true positive rate of our vascular testing product was significantly higher than that of ABI with Doppler by a 2 to 1 margin. The results of the study are available as a white paper that may be shown to potential customers or other interested parties. Among other limitations of the study, the study had a small sample size, was conducted at specialty practices not primary care practices, had a retrospective design with incomplete collection of demographic information and clinical characteristics of the population, was not peer reviewed and was sponsored by us.
Another study also was designed to assess the side-by-side performance of our vascular testing product compared with traditional analog ABI with Doppler measurements in medical practices. In this prospective study at five medical practices during 2013 through 2015, 360 limbs from 180 patients were examined with three techniques: Our vascular testing product, traditional analog ABI with Doppler, and Duplex ultrasound imaging as a gold standard. Results demonstrated that our test demonstrated greater sensitivity, greater accuracy and equivalent specificity compared to ABI with Doppler measurements. The results of the study are available as a white paper. Among limitations of the study are that it had a small sample size, was conducted at a mix of primary care and specialty practices, had no formal tracking of consecutive patients, and was sponsored by us.
Another study, the results of which were compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2018, reported an analysis of a registry of screening PAD testing with our product between January 2017 and July 2017. In this study, 226,565 patients were tested and 31.3% had moderate to severe flow impairment in the lower extremities. Further analysis of a subset of 26,459 patients for whom clinical characteristics were recorded showed that 95% were asymptomatic. The authors concluded that earlier recognition of PAD may lead to earlier secondary preventive measures and improved outcomes for a population with a high-risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned the study’s retrospective design and that clinical factors were recorded for only approximately 10% of patients.
A retrospective case series compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2018 reported on 48 patients that were tested with our product and subsequently had a contrast angiography procedure for clinical indications. Using contrast angiography as the gold standard for determining PAD, the author concluded the data supports the use of our product as an aid for practicing physicians to accurately diagnose PAD in combination with clinical judgment. Among other limitations of the study, the sample size was small, tests were performed at specialty centers, and the analysis was done retrospectively.
Certain racial and economic groups in the United States are underserved by the medical community with limited access to specialists, a lack of early detection programs and inadequate preventive disease management. There is abundant evidence that certain ethnic populations are more at risk for cardiovascular disease and suffer sequelae of untreated PAD. A study was compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2018 that presented a retrospective analysis of 1,901 patients tested with our product at 22 medical practices that serve predominately lower-income, non-white populations. The author concluded that our product can be effectively utilized by primary care clinicians in poor and underserved communities to identify PAD. The author posited that identifying PAD earlier in the disease process can be an important step towards filling the unmet need of higher intensity vascular care for minority populations. Limitations of the study include that it was a retrospective analysis and that there was no protocol to unveil the identity or ethnicity of any of the individual patients.
Women may lack early detection programs and have inadequate preventive disease management. A study was compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2019 that presented a retrospective analysis of 68,402 female patients tested with our product at primary care medical practices in the United States. The author concluded that our product was an efficient means to aid in the diagnosis of PAD in vulnerable women who are currently underserved by their health care providers. Limitations of the study include that it was a retrospective analysis with self-reporting of clinical characteristics.

11



A February 2022 published peer-reviewed study analyzed screening tests using QuantaFlo for undetected and asymptomatic PAD in a Medicare Advantage population between January 2016 and December 2016. In this study, 13,971 patients were tested and 31.6% had a positive result for PAD. Almost 60% had lower socio-economic income level with 15.1% living under the poverty level. The risk associated with detecting PAD was substantial with a 60-70% increased risk of all-cause mortality or morbidity at one year and a 40-50% increased risk of all-cause mortality or morbidity at three years. The risk was not modified by a history of coronary or cerebrovascular artery disease. The authors concluded that these findings highlight an enormous potential to realize cost-savings by reducing cardiovascular event rates and deploying population-based PAD risk mitigation strategies. Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned that they were not able to study the potential impact of PAD risk management strategies used after a positive PAD screen was communicated with the primary care provider and patient. This may have led to an underestimation of the true risk as targeted PAD risk management and behavior modification strategies may have been initiated at the discretion of the provider and patient.

FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
To commercially distribute QuantaFlo or any future medical device we develop requires or will require either prior 510(k) clearance or prior approval of a pre-market approval, or PMA, application from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. Both pre-market clearance and PMA applications are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a medical device manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMA applications. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed, but it can take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new pre-market submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained.
Pre-market Approval Pathway
A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trials, data and manufacturing and labeling to support the FDA’s determination that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. After a PMA application is complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, which impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or pre-market pathway, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

● | establishment registration and device listings with the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality System Regulations, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., “off-label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, that may present a risk to health; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

● | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


● | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


● | recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that are already granted; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA and the California Food and Drug Branch. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
We cannot control whether or not providers who use QuantaFlo will seek third-party coverage for such procedures or reimbursement. If providers intend to seek third-party coverage or reimbursement for use of QuantaFlo, the success of our product could become dependent on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, coverage of the codes by the third-party payors and adequate payment for the resources used.

14



Physician coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association. CMS, the agency responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid, and the National Center for Health Statistics, are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals for reporting inpatient procedures, and many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. All physician and hospital coding is subject to change, which could impact coverage and reimbursement and physician practice behavior. We do not track denial of requests for reimbursement made by the users of QuantaFlo. It is our belief that such denials have occurred and might occur in the future with more or less frequency. We are not in the business of performing QuantaFlo measurements that require us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, including those that offer Medicare Advantage plans, and managed care programs. Many of our customers are third-party payors who pay us directly for use of our product and services.
Independent of the coding status, third-party payors may deny coverage based on their own criteria, such as if they believe that the clinical efficacy of a device or procedure is not well established and is deemed experimental or investigational, is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or is used for an unapproved indication. We will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients, physicians, hospitals and insurers in order to promote the best in patient care and clarity regarding reimbursement and work to obtain appropriate coverage policies. For some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for the procedures performed with our products, if any payment is made at all. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicaid continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior. For example, if CMS decreases the monthly payment for a 65-year-old patient, then the provider will have to decide which steps to eliminate from his or her routine office visits in order to maintain a profitable business model. If the time of an office visit will need to be reduced to maintain a profitable business, a provider may decide to eliminate certain services or conducting certain procedures, such as deciding not to use a thermometer, take someone’s blood pressure or use a QuantaFlo to run an ABI test. Thus, reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS on providers may affect their decision making about which services to provide during an office visit, which could affect our company.
Particularly in the United States, third-party payors carefully review, have undertaken cost-containment initiatives, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products as well as any technology that they, in their own judgment, consider experimental or investigational. In addition, an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval or pre-authorization of the services that a member will receive. Many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined amount per member per month. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the United States over the next decade.
There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
Our operations may be subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations including fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws and transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.
The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Law is subject to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Law to reach large 

15



settlements with healthcare companies based on, among other things, inappropriate consultant arrangements with physicians or questionable joint venture arrangements. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes.
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the civil False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions. In addition, off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their independent medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil, criminal and administrative penalties.
The Health Care Reform Law also imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals. Such information is now made publicly available in a searchable format, and device manufacturers are now required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report such information regarding their payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
Our business operations may also be subject to certain federal and state laws regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which impose obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
In addition, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value 

16



made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.
The U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of devices we distribute.
If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe penalties including, for example, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and the results of our operations.
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for QuantaFlo or what actions foreign, federal, state or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation.
Healthcare Reform
Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. For example, the Health Care Reform Law significantly changed the health care industry and brought a new way of doing business for providers and health insurance plans.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Health Care Reform Law. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law such as removing penalties, effective January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Health Care Reform Law’s “individual mandate” to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain Health Care Reform Law-mandated fees, and increasing certain discounts owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the 

17



remaining provisions of the Health Care Reform Law are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the United States Supreme Court has yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Health Care Reform Law, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Health Care Reform Law marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Health Care Reform Law. It is unclear how the United States Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Health Care Reform Law and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since Health Care Reform Law. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to cost-containment initiatives within the health care industry. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 124 employees, all of which were full-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. We also regularly engage consultants and subcontractors on an as-needed basis. We increased our head count in the fiscal year 2021 from 86 to 124, which represents a 44% increase from the prior year. As we grow our business, we expect to continue to experience growth in the number of our employees, particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, and distribution. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We use different incentive plans such as annual cash bonuses, no-cost healthcare for employees and their families, paid vacation and generous referral bonuses to attract, retain and motivate our employees.
Governance and Culture - Our board of directors, including committees thereof, and executive management team are actively involved in overseeing our employee-related strategies and practices as well as our company culture. Our director of human resources and her team are also actively involved in implementing these decisions. We believe our company culture has been a critical component of our success in attracting and retaining personnel.
Diversity and Inclusion - We aim to create an inclusive working environment where all employees are respected and treated equally. We value diversity of backgrounds and perspectives and our policy is that we do not discriminate based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military and veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristics established by federal, state or local laws. This message is emphasized from the top of our organization down to all of our employees. 
Health, Safety and Well-Being - The safety and well-being of our employees is critical to our successful operation. Our health and safety activities are overseen by our board of directors, executive management team and director of human resources. Most of our employees work remotely, with the exception of a few employees who work in the office. These employees are generally in fulfillment and sales support roles. Our human resources department coordinates on-line training programs with the help of outside consultants. We believe that this model of training better fits our business operations and needs.

Response to COVID-19
As a virtual company, we were better prepared than many at home offices to deal with the effects of the global spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Given governmental restrictions mandating “shelter-in-place” or similar limitations, our sales personnel had to eliminate travel, increase the use of our on-line platforms and create new means to replace training methods and hands-on interactions with the customers that we relied on pre-pandemic. To date, we have not terminated any of our employees due to the pandemic. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation and, if needed, will evolve our plans and policies to keep our employees and customers safe.
