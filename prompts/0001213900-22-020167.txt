Electronic Cigarettes, Personal Vaporizers, Medical Vaporizers for Cannabis Use



“Electronic cigarettes” or “e-cigarettes,” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes and, regardless of their construction are comprised of three functional components:

● | A mouthpiece, which is a small plastic cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The electronics, which include: a lithium-ion battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED, which illuminates to indicate use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




When a user draws air through the electronic cigarette, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution stored in the mouthpiece/cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine-free solution, either of which may be flavored.



We have developed a line of electronic cigarette e-liquids which were previously sold under the brand name “Helium.” We plan to develop a complete line of disposable and rechargeable electronic personal vaporizers for cannabis and CBD under the Helium brand.



Disposable electronic vaporizers feature a one-piece construction that houses all the components and is utilized until the nicotine or nicotine-free solution is depleted.



Rechargeable electronic vaporizers feature a rechargeable battery and replaceable cartridge. The cartridges are changed when the solution is depleted from use.



Personal vaporizers are similar in form and function to electronic cigarettes but typically have a larger form factor and are used to vaporize solutions that are not nicotine-based and may include flavors and or flavor combinations. They are most widely used for cannabis extracts including CBD.



Personal vaporizers or vaporizers typically feature a tank and a chamber, a heating element and a battery. The vaporizer user fills the tank with a liquid solution or the chamber with wax, dry herb or leaf. The vaporizer battery can be recharged and the tank and chamber can be refilled.










Medical vaporizers for cannabis use function similarly to electronic cigarettes and vaporizers but have unique design characteristics to enable patients to vape the different forms of cannabis. Generally, these forms are essential oils, concentrates, as well as dry herb. This results in a similar effect but it is cannabis concentrates being vaporized instead of nicotine liquid or a flavored cartridge, so the design has to be changed to vaporize these different textures.



We have developed a line of vaporizers that are for use with medical cannabis under the “HONEYSTICK” brand. These vaporizers are designed for sale in the medical and recreational cannabis markets and currently feature mainly vaporizers for essential oils and concentrates. We plan to launch and develop more units for dry herb and continue to expand the line to offer more innovative technology that is high performance and convenient. The Company also conducts most of its private label production for cannabis oriented vaporizers.



The U.S. Market for Electronic Cigarettes and Medical Cannabis Vaporizers



Electronic cigarettes are generally marketed as an alternative to traditional tobacco-burning cigarettes. Because electronic cigarettes offer a “smoking” experience without the burning of tobacco leaf, electronic cigarettes offer users the ability to satisfy their nicotine cravings without the byproducts of smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. In many cases electronic cigarettes are not subject to the use prohibitions of tobacco-burning cigarettes and therefore, may be used in more places than conventional cigarettes. Certain states, cities, businesses, providers of transportation and public venues in the U.S. have already banned the use of electronic cigarettes, however, and others are considering banning the use of electronic cigarettes. We cannot provide any assurances that the use of electronic cigarettes will not be banned anywhere traditional tobacco-burning cigarette use is banned.



We believe that the market for medical and recreational cannabis products, including cannabis vape products, continues to expand as the legal climate within the U.S. has resulted in more states permitting recreational and/or medical cannabis use. Vape products are growing as a delivery device because they allow very convenient, effective and discrete ways of delivery that minimize, odor and exposure. Vape products also allow for the vaporization of all textures of cannabis, which allows for effective dosing.



The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal purposes.



The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the CSA, which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of the drug cannabidiol (“CBD”), a non-psychoactive ingredient in the cannabis plant, for the treatment of seizures associated with two epilepsy conditions. The FDA has not approved cannabis or cannabis compounds as a safe and effective drug for any other condition. Moreover, pursuant to the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”), CBD remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, with a narrow exception for CBD derived from hemp with a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) concentration of less than 0.3%.



The Company maintains its operations so as to remain in compliance with the CSA. Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical marijuana has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use and cultivation all remain violations of federal law that are punishable by imprisonment and substantial fines, and the prescription of marijuana is a violation of federal law. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they intentionally aid and abet another in violating these federal controlled substance laws or conspire with another to violate them.



The inconsistencies between federal and state regulation of cannabis were addressed in a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) which then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. District Attorneys in 2013 outlining certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memo acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memo noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memo’s enforcement priorities. The DOJ did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memo. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memo concluded that the DOJ should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors.










On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a new memorandum (the “Sessions Memo”) which rescinded the Cole Memo. The Sessions Memo stated, in part, that current law reflects “Congress’ determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime,” and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress by following well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. The Company is not aware of any prosecutions of investment companies doing routine business with licensed marijuana related businesses in light of the DOJ position following issuance of the Sessions Memo. However, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. As a result of the Sessions Memo, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities, despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memo as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and thus it is uncertain how active U.S. federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities.



Federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memo’s priorities as an enforcement guide. Merrick Garland, who became Attorney General on March 10, 2021, has indicated that he would deprioritize enforcement of low-level cannabis crimes such as possession, and has shared his view that the government should focus on large-scale criminal enterprises that circumvent state legalization laws instead of going after people who abide by local cannabis policies. The Company believes it is too soon to determine what prosecutorial effects will be created by the rescission of the Cole Memo or any replacement thereof and when or if the Sessions Memo will be rescinded. President Joseph R. Biden, who assumed office in January 2021, has not yet indicated whether and when he will decriminalize or legalize cannabis and has previously stated that he is opposed to legalization. The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the DOJ and the current administration. Regardless, at this time, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law regarding the sale and disbursement of medical or adult use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. It is unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered.



One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill, remains in place following the rescission of the Cole Memo. For several years, Congress has adopted a so-called “rider” provision to the Consolidated Appropriations Act (formerly referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment and currently referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Despite the rescission of the Cole Memo, the DOJ appears to continue to adhere to the enforcement priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.



The Cole Memo and the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment gave licensed cannabis operators (particularly medical cannabis operators) and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding the DOJ’s enforcement priorities and the risk of operating cannabis businesses. While the Sessions Memo has introduced some uncertainty regarding federal enforcement, the cannabis industry continues to experience growth in legal medical and adult use markets across the United States. When she was a U.S. Senator, Vice President Kamala Harris was the lead sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act, which seeks to end the federal prohibition of marijuana, among other things, but in March 2020, it was reported that Vice President Harris has adopted the same position as President Biden, who opposes legalization. Currently, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will remain in place or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis.



Although the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, and federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level.



State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and/or adult use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under any and all circumstances under the CSA. Although the Company’s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.










As of December 31, 2021, 37 states, plus the District of Columbia (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands), have legalized the medical use of cannabis. In 18 of those states, the sale and possession of cannabis is legal for both medical and adult use, and the District of Columbia has legalized adult use but not commercial sale. Eleven other states have laws that limit THC content, for the purpose of allowing access to CBD products.



Although we are not engaged in the purchase, sale, growth, cultivation, harvesting, or processing of marijuana products, strict enforcement of federal prohibitions regarding marijuana could irreparably harm our business, subject us to criminal prosecution and/or adversely affect the trading price of our securities. We cannot provide any assurances that federal regulations will not inhibit the growth, expansion, or legality of the cannabis movement which is highly interdependent in the growth of sales of our vaporizers.



As part of the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,” in the most recent COVID-19 relief bill signed into law on December 27, 2020, the U.S. Congress amended the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (“PACT”) Act to apply to e-cigarettes and all vaping products. Originally passed in 2009, the PACT Act amended the existing Jenkins Act of 1949, which required interstate shippers to report cigarette sales to state tobacco tax administrators in order to combat illicit sales and tax avoidance. The PACT Act, among other things, prohibited the use of the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) to deliver cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products directly to consumers.



In addition to the non-mailing provisions, the PACT Act requires anyone who sells cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the “ATF”) and the tobacco tax administrators of the states into which a shipment is made or in which an advertisement or offer is disseminated. Delivery sellers who ship cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to consumers are further required to label packages as containing tobacco, verify the age and identity of the customer at purchase, use a delivery method (other than USPS) that checks identification and obtains adult customer signature at delivery, and maintain records of delivery sales for a period of four years after the date of sale, among other things.



The PACT Act also requires sellers to file a monthly report with the state tobacco tax administrator and any other local or tribal entity that taxes the sale of cigarettes. Such reports must include the name and address of the persons delivering and receiving the shipment and the brand and quantity of the “cigarettes” that were shipped. These requirements apply to all sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including sales to consumers and sales between businesses.



The PACT Act mandates that the ATF maintain a non-compliant list of persons who fail to comply with the Act. Placement on the list bars common carriers and other persons from delivering products sold by the listed company. ATF distributes the list to common carriers, USPS, credit card companies, and others to help enforce the list.



The 2020 PACT Act amendment, the “Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act,” modifies the original definition of “cigarette” in the PACT Act to include Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (“ENDS”). The term “ENDS” is defined very broadly to essentially include all vaping products, liquids, components, and accessories, whether they contain nicotine or not. Specifically, an ENDS product is defined as “any electronic device that, through an aerosolized solution, delivers nicotine, flavor, or any other substance to the user inhaling from the device,” including “an e-cigarette; an e-hookah; an e-cigar; a vape pen; an advanced refillable personal vaporizer; an electronic pipe; and any component, liquid, part, or accessory of a device described [above], without regard to whether the component, liquid, part, or accessory is sold separately from the device.” (Emphasis added.) Based on this definition of ENDS, zero-nicotine e-liquids, synthetic “tobacco-free” nicotine e-cigarettes, and CBD/THC/hemp vape pens, among other things, would all appear to be captured.



The PACT Act requirements summarized above became effective in March 2021. Certain requirements (e.g., labeling, weight restrictions, and 21+ age verification on delivery) only apply to direct-to-consumer sales (made through common carriers or private delivery services). The registration and reporting requirements apply to all sales, including business-to-business sales.



As noted, the amended PACT Act now prohibits the use of the USPS to deliver “ENDS” directly to consumers. On October 21, 2021, the USPS issued final rules regarding the mailability of ENDS products through the USPS, while also clarifying which products are and are not covered by the rule. The final rules clarified that hemp vape products are included within the definition of ENDS, and are thus nonmailable. The rule also provides that a legally operating ENDS business may apply to USPS for a business-to-business exception to the general rule prohibiting the mailing of such products.










The PACT Act has historically exempted businesses-to-business deliveries from the USPS ban. Specifically, the USPS ban does not extend to tobacco products mailed only for business purposes between legally operating businesses that have all applicable State and Federal Government licenses or permits and are engaged in tobacco product manufacturing, distribution, wholesale, export, import, testing, investigation, or research. Companies seeking to use USPS for business-to-business deliveries must first submit an application to the USPS Pricing and Classification Service Center and comply with several other shipping, labeling, and delivery requirements.



Critically for the vapor industry, the most commonly used carriers, Federal Express and United Parcel Service (“UPS”), ceased all deliveries of vapor products. 



Global Market



According to a February 2020 Grand View Research report, the global e-cigarette and vape market size was valued at $ 12.41 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a revenue-based estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.8% from 2020 to 2027. The market is expected to gain traction over the forecast period, owing to increasing product demand from millennials. The availability of a variety of e-cigarette options is anticipated to further fuel the product adoption.



In 2019, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) estimated that there were approximately seven million adults vaping or using e-cigarettes in 2016. According to the WHO, this number increased to 35 million by 2019. Euromonitor estimates that 55 million adults worldwide will be vaping by 2021, and noted that, as of 2018, there has been an increase of 28 million individuals vaping globally. According to Euromonitor, in 2014, the global vaping market was worth $18.4 billion. Euromonitor reports that by 2018, the market value had increased to $22.6 billion.



We believe that the largest markets for vaping products are the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States. According to a Vape Beat 2019 survey, e-cigarette users in Europe increased by 86% between 2013 and 2018, and of all the vapers in Europe, 2.8 million live in England. Of the vapers surveyed by Vape Beat, 37% previously smoked cigarettes, and 40% had not previously vaped or used e-cigarettes. The BBC reported in 2019 that Europe represented the biggest market for e-cigarettes, with approximately 2,000 vaping outlets.



Out of 3,000 vapers surveyed by Kantar in 2018, 21% purchased their supplies at online stores. The BBC also reported that nearly 50% of all flavored e-cigarettes being sold are fruit or cannabis flavored.



Distribution and Sales



The distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market, whether it be geographical, demographical, or genre (cannabis or e-liquid).



Our sales and distribution channels are:




● | Direct sales and distribution, where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution within a single market. 
● | Exclusive territory and exclusive channel distribution, where distributors have an exclusive territory within a country or an exclusive right to sell within a distribution channel (e.g. gas stations). 
● | Distribution through wholesalers, where we supply either national or regional wholesalers who then service retailers. 
● | Internet/e-commerce sales, where we sell directly to end users through one of our internet websites and/or landing pages. 
● | Distribution through online distributors that sell to an extensive network of resellers. 
● | Distribution through dispensaries who are responsible for dispensing medical or recreational cannabis. 

Business Strategy



VPR Brands is a holding company, whose assets include an issued U.S. patent for atomization related products, including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components, as well as pocket lighters. The Company is also engaged in product development for the vapor or vaping market, including e-liquids. Electronic cigarettes are electronic devices which deliver nicotine through atomization, or vaping of e-liquids and without smoke and other chemicals constituents typically found in traditional tobacco burning cigarette products.



Our portfolio of electronic cigarette personal vaporizer and pocket lighter patents are the basis for our efforts to:




● | Design, market and distribute a line of pocket lighters under the “DISSIM” brand; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Design, market and distribute a line of vaporizers for essential oils, concentrates, and dry herbs under the “HONEYSTICK” brand; 
● | Design, market and distribute a line of CBD products under the “GOLD LINE” brand; 
● | Design, market and distribute electronic cigarettes and popular vaporizers; 


● | Prosecute and enforce our patent rights; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | License our intellectual property; and 
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Develop private label manufacturing programs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------




Our electronic cigarette e-liquids are marketed as an alternative to tobacco burning cigarettes.



We design, develop, market and distribute a line of products oriented toward the cannabis markets, which is the HoneyStick brand of vaporizers and the Goldline CBD products. This allows us to capitalize on the rapidly growing expansion within the cannabis markets. The original HoneyStick vaporizer placed second in the High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup in 2016, greatly popularizing the brand and making its performance recognized.



Patent Rights



We are evaluating our options and conducting investigations to determine if our intellectual property is being infringed upon in the U.S. and if so, by whom. We are exploring legal options and strategies related to prosecuting infringers and pursuing available remedies. The Company has hired a law firm on contingency basis to file suit against infringers.



License of our Technology



In light of recent lawsuits filed against several electronic cigarette companies, we believe that an opportunity exists to license our patented technology to companies named in those lawsuits and others who may be seeking an alternative to the electronic cigarette technologies which are or may be subject to patent litigation. The Company is actively enforcing its intellectual property rights via lawsuits against infringers.



Private Label



As an extension of our plan to license our technology to other electronic cigarette companies, we plan to offer private label manufacturing programs for electronic cigarette as well as cannabis vape companies that would rather purchase a finished manufactured product, rather than simply purchasing a license to manufacture their products using our technology. We believe that we have a greater understanding of the manufacturing process than a licensee would and that we can better oversee the manufacturing process of our patented technologies and offer a more reliable and higher quality product through our supply chain than can otherwise be achieved by third parties.
Competition



Competition in the electronic cigarette and vaporizer industry is intense. We compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes, the nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our electronic cigarette products. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through distributors, wholesalers and retailers, including but not limited to national chain stores, tobacco shops, dispensaries gas stations, travel stores, shopping mall kiosks, in addition to direct to public sales through the internet, mail order and telesales. As a general matter, we have access to and market and sell the similar electronic cigarettes as our competitors and since we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors.



Part of our business strategy focuses on the establishment of contractual relationships with distributors and prominent branding focused on performance and quality. We are aware that e-cigarette competitors in the industry are also seeking to enter into such contractual relationships and try to create brand loyalty. In many cases, competitors for such contracts may have greater management, human, and financial resources than we do for entering into such contracts and for attracting distributor relationships. Furthermore, certain of our electronic cigarette competitors may have better control of their supply and distribution, be, better established, larger and better financed than our Company.



We also compete against “big tobacco”, U.S. cigarette manufacturers of both conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes like Altria Group, Inc., Lorillard, Inc. and Reynolds American, Inc. We compete against big tobacco who offers not only conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes but also smokeless tobacco products such as “snus” (a form of moist ground smokeless tobacco that is usually sold in sachet form that resembles small tea bags), chewing tobacco and snuff. Big tobacco has nearly limitless resources, global distribution networks in place and a customer base that is fiercely loyal to their brands. Furthermore, we believe that big tobacco will devote more attention and resources to developing and offering electronic cigarettes as the market for electronic cigarettes grows. Because of their well-established sales and distribution channels, marketing expertise and significant resources, big tobacco is better positioned than small competitors like us to capture a larger share of the electronic cigarette market.



We also face competition from manufacturers in China as they try to increase their U.S. presence by marketing directly to members within our supply and value chain similar products.



We may also face competition from other patent holders, including but not limited to, Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Europe’s second-biggest tobacco company, who in September 2013 acquired a portfolio of electronic cigarette patents from Dragonite International Ltd. (formerly Ruyan Group Holdings Limited) for $75 million, as we attempt to negotiate and contract with other electronic cigarette companies to license our intellectual property.



Manufacturing



We depend on third party manufacturers for our electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and accessories. Our customers associate certain characteristics of our products including the weight, feel, draw, unique flavor, packaging and other attributes of our products to the brands we market, distribute and sell. Any interruption in supply and/or consistency of our products may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products to our wholesalers, distributors and customers and otherwise harm our relationships and reputation with customers, and have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Although we believe that several alternative sources for our products are available, any failure to obtain the components, chemical constituents and manufacturing services necessary for the production of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Source and Availability of Raw Materials



We believe that an adequate supply of product and raw materials will be available to us as needed and from multiple sources and suppliers.










Intellectual Property

Government Regulations



Tobacco Deemed Products



Pursuant to a December 2010 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in Sottera, Inc. v. Food & Drug Administration, 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the FDA is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “tobacco products” under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the “Tobacco Control Act”). Under this Court decision, the FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “drugs” or “devices” or a “combination product” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. 



The Tobacco Control Act also requires establishment, within the FDA’s new Center for Tobacco Products, of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products.



The FDA had previously indicated that it intended to regulate e-cigarettes under the Tobacco Control Act through the issuance of “Deeming Regulations” that would include e-liquid, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products (collectively, “Deemed Tobacco Products”) under the Tobacco Control Act and subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.



On May 10, 2016, the FDA issued the “Deeming Regulations” which came into effect August 8, 2016. The Deeming Regulations amended the definition of “tobacco products” to include e-liquid, e-cigarettes and other vaping products. Deemed Tobacco Products include, but are not limited to, e-liquids, atomizers, batteries, cartomizers, clearomisers, tank systems, flavors, bottles that contain e-liquids and programmable software. Beginning August 8, 2016, Deemed Tobacco Products became subject to all FDA regulations applicable to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, and other tobacco products which require:




● | a prohibition on sales to those younger than 18 years of age and requirements for verification by means of photographic identification (in December 2019, the federal minimum age for sale of tobacco products was raised from 18 to 21 years); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | health and addictiveness warnings on product packages and in advertisements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a ban on vending machine sales unless the vending machines are located in a facility where the retailer ensures that individuals under 18 years of age are prohibited from entering at any time; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | registration with, and reporting of product and ingredient listings to, the FDA; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no marketing of new tobacco products prior to FDA review; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no direct and implied claims of reduced risk such as “light”, “low” and “mild” descriptions unless FDA confirms (a) that scientific evidence supports the claim and (b) that marketing the product will benefit public health; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | ban on free samples; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | childproof packaging. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, the Deeming Regulations requires any Deemed Tobacco Product that was not commercially marketed as of the “grandfathering” date of February 15, 2007, to obtain premarket approval before it can be marketed in the United States. Premarket approval could take any of the following three pathways: (1) submission of a premarket tobacco product application (“PMTA”) and receipt of a marketing authorization order; (2) submission of a substantial equivalence report and receipt of a substantial equivalence order; or (3) submission of a request for an exemption from substantial equivalence requirements and receipt of an substantial equivalence exemption determination. The Company cannot predict if any of the products in our product line, all of which would be considered “non-grandfathered”, will receive the required premarket approval from the FDA if the Company were to undertake obtaining premarket approval through any of the available pathways.










Since there were virtually no e-liquid, e-cigarettes or other vaping products on the market as of February 15, 2007, there is no way to utilize the less onerous substantial equivalence or substantial equivalence exemption pathways that traditional tobacco corporation can utilize. In order to obtain premarket approval, practically all e-liquid, e-cigarettes or other vaping products would have to follow the PMTA pathway which would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per application. Furthermore, the Deeming Regulations also effectively froze the U.S. market on August 8, 2016 since any new e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping product would be required to obtain an FDA marketing authorization though one of the aforementioned pathways. Deemed Tobacco Products that were on the market prior to August 8, 2016 have been provided with a grace period where such products can continue to be marketed until the May 12, 2020 PMTA submission deadline. Upon submission of a PMTA, such products would be permitted to be sold pending the FDA’s review of the submitted PMTAs, even if the May 12, 2020 deadline has passed.



In a press release dated July 28, 2017, the FDA also stated that “the FDA plans to issue foundational rules to make the product review process more efficient, predictable, and transparent for manufacturers, while upholding the agency’s public health mission. Among other things, the FDA intends to issue regulations outlining what information the agency expects to be included in PMTAs, Modified Risk Tobacco Product (“MRTP”) applications and reports to demonstrate Substantial Equivalence (“SE”). The FDA also plans to finalize guidance on how it intends to review PMTAs for ENDS. The agency also will continue efforts to assist industry in complying with federal tobacco regulations through online information, meetings, webinars and guidance documents”.



The Company has not filed any PMTAs. We have switched all of our nicotine products to Tobacco Free Nicotine and/or have almost completely stopped selling nicotine based vapor products. The Company has determined to focus on cannabis vape hardware products and lighters.



In addition to federal regulation, state and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom tobacco products can be sold and by whom, in addition to where tobacco products, specifically cigarettes may be smoked and where they may not. Certain municipalities have enacted local ordinances which preclude the use of e-liquid, e-cigarettes and other vaping products where traditional tobacco burning cigarettes cannot be used and certain states have proposed legislation that would categorize vaping products as tobacco products, equivalent to their tobacco burning counterparts. If these bills become laws, vaping products may lose their appeal as an alternative to traditional cigarettes, which may have the effect of reducing the demand for the products.



The Company may be required to discontinue, prohibit or suspend sales of its e-liquid products in states that require us to obtain a retail tobacco license. If the Company is unable to obtain certain licenses, approvals or permits and if the Company is not able to obtain the necessary licenses, approvals or permits for financial reasons or otherwise and/or any such license, approval or permit is determined to be overly burdensome to the Company, then the Company may be required to cease sales and distribution of its e-liquid products to those states, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.



As a result of FDA import alert 66-41 (which allows the detention of unapproved drugs promoted in the U.S.), U.S. Customs has from time to time temporarily and in some instances indefinitely detained certain products. If the FDA modifies the import alert from its current form which allows U.S. Customs discretion to release the products, to a mandatory and definitive hold the Company may no longer be able to ensure a supply of raw materials or saleable product, which will have material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.



At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the USPS to mail most tobacco products and which amends the Jenkins Act, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to electronic cigarettes. The application of either or both of these federal laws to electronic cigarettes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



As part of the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,” in the most recent COVID-19 relief bill signed into law on December 27, 2020, the U.S. Congress amended the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (“PACT”) Act to apply to e-cigarettes and all vaping products.










Originally passed in 2009, the PACT Act amended the existing Jenkins Act of 1949, which required interstate shippers to report cigarette sales to state tobacco tax administrators in order to combat illicit sales and tax avoidance. The PACT Act, among other things, prohibited the use of the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) to deliver cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products directly to consumers.



In addition to the non-mailing provisions, the PACT Act requires anyone who sells cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the “ATF”) and the tobacco tax administrators of the states into which a shipment is made or in which an advertisement or offer is disseminated. Delivery sellers who ship cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to consumers are further required to label packages as containing tobacco, verify the age and identity of the customer at purchase, use a delivery method (other than USPS) that checks identification and obtains adult customer signature at delivery, and maintain records of delivery sales for a period of four years after the date of sale, among other things.



The PACT Act also requires sellers to file a monthly report with the state tobacco tax administrator and any other local or tribal entity that taxes the sale of cigarettes. Such reports must include the name and address of the persons delivering and receiving the shipment and the brand and quantity of the “cigarettes” that were shipped. These requirements apply to all sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including sales to consumers and sales between businesses.



The PACT Act mandates that the ATF maintain a non-compliant list of persons who fail to comply with the Act. Placement on the list bars common carriers and other persons from delivering products sold by the listed company. ATF distributes the list to common carriers, USPS, credit card companies, and others to help enforce the list.



The 2020 PACT Act amendment, the “Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act,” modifies the original definition of “cigarette” in the PACT Act to include Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (“ENDS”). The term “ENDS” is defined very broadly to essentially include all vaping products, liquids, components, and accessories, whether they contain nicotine or not. Specifically, an ENDS product is defined as “any electronic device that, through an aerosolized solution, delivers nicotine, flavor, or any other substance to the user inhaling from the device,” including “an e-cigarette; an e-hookah; an e-cigar; a vape pen; an advanced refillable personal vaporizer; an electronic pipe; and any component, liquid, part, or accessory of a device described [above], without regard to whether the component, liquid, part, or accessory is sold separately from the device.” (Emphasis added.) Based on this definition of ENDS, zero-nicotine e-liquids, synthetic “tobacco-free” nicotine e-cigarettes, and CBD/THC/hemp vape pens, among other things, would all appear to be captured.



The PACT Act requirements summarized above became effective in March 2021. Certain requirements (e.g., labeling, weight restrictions, and 21+ age verification on delivery) only apply to direct-to-consumer sales (made through common carriers or private delivery services). The registration and reporting requirements apply to all sales, including business-to-business sales.



As noted, the amended PACT Act now prohibits the use of the USPS to deliver “ENDS” directly to consumers. On October 21, 2021, the USPS issued final rules regarding the mailability of ENDS products through the USPS, while also clarifying which products are and are not covered by the rule. The final rules clarified that hemp vape products are included within the definition of ENDS, and are thus nonmailable. The rule also provides that a legally operating ENDS business may apply to USPS for a business-to-business exception to the general rule prohibiting the mailing of such products.



The PACT Act has historically exempted businesses-to-business deliveries from the USPS ban. Specifically, the USPS ban does not extend to tobacco products mailed only for business purposes between legally operating businesses that have all applicable State and Federal Government licenses or permits and are engaged in tobacco product manufacturing, distribution, wholesale, export, import, testing, investigation, or research. Companies seeking to use USPS for business-to-business deliveries must first submit an application to the USPS Pricing and Classification Service Center and comply with several other shipping, labeling, and delivery requirements.



Critically for the vapor industry, the most commonly used carriers, Federal Express and United Parcel Service (“UPS”), ceased all deliveries of vapor products.










The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:




● | the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If e-liquid, e-cigarettes or other vaping products are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiatives enacted under the FCTC, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 



Canada



E-cigarettes with or without nicotine are legal in Canada. In May 2018, Bill S-5: An Act to amend the Tobacco Act and Non-smokers’ Health Act received Royal Assent established a new legislative framework to regulate the manufacturing, sale, labelling and promotions of vaping products in Canada. Sales of vaping products containing nicotine are permitted to adults 18 years of age and older. Vaping products containing cannabis are regulated under the Cannabis Act and its regulations. The Cannabis Act became law on October 17, 2018, and establishes the framework for controlling the production, sale and possession of cannabis across Canada. On October 17, 2019, cannabis extracts, including vaping products, became legal for sale in Canada. As with vaping products containing nicotine, the safety of cannabis vaping devices (such as the batteries) is regulated under the CCPSA.
Company’s Efforts to Mitigate Risks Associated with New and Evolving Regulation



The Company is constantly seeking to stay in compliance with all existing and reasonably expected future regulations. The Company, through its internal compliance team, market consultants and technicians and testing labs hopes to stay in accordance with all standards whether set forth in the New Tobacco Products Directive or the Deeming Regulations. Making sure that all e-liquid products meet and exceed the standards set forth by each market’s regulatory body is of the highest concern for the Company. Staying in compliance with all marketing and packaging directives is imperative to maintaining access to the markets. Although these processes are costly and time consuming, it is imperative for the Company’s success that these steps are taken and constantly kept up to date. Failure to comply in a timely fashion to any particular directive or regulation could have material adverse effects on the results of business operations.










CBD Products



The Company’s CBD products are subject to various state and federal laws regarding the production and sales of hemp-based products. Section 12619 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (“2018 Farm Bill”) removed “hemp,” as defined in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (the “1946 Agricultural Act”), from the classification of “marijuana,” which is generally prohibited as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”). Under the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill), the term “hemp” means “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” As a result of the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, and since the Company believes its CBD products contain parts of the cannabis plant with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, the Company believes that its CBD products are not governed by the CSA and, ergo, would not be subject to prosecution thereunder because the Company believes its CBD products contain “hemp” within the meaning of the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) and do not contain any “marijuana” as prohibited under the CSA (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill); provided, however, there is a lack of legal protection for hemp-based products that contain more than 0.3 percent THC and there is a risk that the Company would be subject to prosecution under the CSA in the event that its CBD products are found to contain more than 0.3 percent THC.



Furthermore, the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) provides additional regulations regarding the production of hemp-based products and there is the risk that its CBD products may be found to be in violation of these regulations. Specifically, the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) contains provisions relating to the shared state-federal jurisdiction over hemp cultivation and production, whereby states and Indian tribes have been delegated the broad authority to regulate and limit the production and sale of hemp and hemp products within their borders. Under the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill), a plan under which a State or Indian tribe monitors and regulates the production of hemp shall only be required to include “(i) a practice to maintain relevant information regarding land on which hemp is produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe, including a legal description of the land, for a period of not less than three calendar years; (ii) a procedure for testing, using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration levels of hemp produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe; (iii) a procedure for the effective disposal of—(I) plants, whether growing or not, that are produced in violation of this subtitle; and (II) products derived from those plants; (iv) a procedure to comply with enforcement procedures; (v) a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of hemp producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of applicable law; (vi) a procedure for submitting the information, as applicable, to the Secretary of Agriculture (the “Secretary”) not more than 30 days after the date on which the information is received; and (vii) a certification that the State or Indian tribe has the resources and personnel to carry out the practices and procedures described in clauses (i) through (vi).” Further, a hemp producer in a State or the territory of an Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is approved shall be determined to have negligently violated the State or Tribal plan, including by negligently— “(i) failing to provide a legal description of land on which the producer produces hemp; (ii) failing to obtain a license or other required authorization from the State department of agriculture or Tribal government, as applicable; or (iii) producing Cannabis sativa L. with a delta-9 THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” A hemp producer that negligently violates a State or Tribal plan 3 times in a 5-year period shall be ineligible to produce hemp for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the third violation. If the State department of agriculture or Tribal government in a State or the territory of an Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan, as applicable, determines that a hemp producer in the State or territory has violated the State or Tribal plan with a culpable mental state greater than negligence— “(i) the State department of agriculture or Tribal government, as applicable, shall immediately report the hemp producer to —(I) the Attorney General; and (II) the chief law enforcement officer of the State or Indian tribe, as applicable.” In the case of a State or Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is not approved, the production of hemp in that State or the territory of that Indian tribe shall be subject to a plan established by the Secretary to monitor and regulate that production. A plan established by the Secretary under shall include— “(A) a practice to maintain relevant information regarding land on which hemp is produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe, including a legal description of the land, for a period of not less than 3 calendar years; (B) a procedure for testing, using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration levels of hemp produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe; (C) a procedure for the effective disposal of—(i) plants, whether growing or not, that are produced in violation of applicable law; and (ii) products derived from those plants; (D) a procedure to comply with the enforcement procedures; (E) a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of hemp producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of this subtitle; and (F) such other practices or procedures as the Secretary considers to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also establish a procedure to issue licenses to hemp producers. In the case of a State or Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is not approved under applicable law, it shall be unlawful to produce hemp in that State or the territory of that Indian tribe without a license issued by the Secretary. A violation of a plan established by the Secretary shall be subject to enforcement and the Secretary shall report the production of hemp without a license issued by the Secretary to the Attorney General. In the event that the Company’s CBD products are found to be in violation of these regulations, the Company may become subject to enforcement action as provided for in the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) and may become subject to prosecution thereunder.










Financing Transaction



The Equity Line



On February 19, 2020 (the “Execution Date”), the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”) with DiamondRock, LLC (the “Investor”) pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Investor committed to purchase shares of the Company’s common units (the “Put Shares”) at an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000,000 (the “Maximum Commitment Amount”) over the course of the commitment period.



Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, the commitment period will commence upon the initial effective date of the Form S-1 Registration Statement planned to be filed to register the Put Shares in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement as further described below and will end on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Investor has purchased Put Shares from the Company pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement equal to the Maximum Commitment Amount, (ii) the date on which there is no longer an effective registration statement for the Put Shares, (iii) 24 months after the initial effectiveness of the Registration Statement planned to be filed to register the Put Shares in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement as further described below, or (iv) written notice of termination by the Company to the Investor (which will not occur at any time that the Investor holds any of the Put Shares).



From time to time over the term of the Equity Purchase Agreement, commencing on the date on which a registration statement registering the Put Shares (the “Registration Statement”) becomes effective, the Company may, in its sole discretion, provide the Investor with a put notice (each a “Put Notice”) to purchase a specified number of the Put Shares (each a “Put Amount Requested”) subject to the limitations discussed below and contained in the Equity Purchase Agreement. Within two trading days of the date that the Put Notice is deemed delivered (“Put Date”) pursuant to terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Investor, the estimated amount of Put Shares equal to the investment amount (“Investment Amount”) indicated in the Put Notice divided by the “Initial Pricing” per share, as such term is defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Estimated Put Shares”) as DWAC Shares. Within two trading days following the Put Date, the Investor shall pay the Investment Amount to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds.



At the end of the five trading days following the clearing date associated with the applicable Put Notice (“Valuation Period”), the purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) shall be computed as 85% of the average daily volume weighted average price of the Company’s common units during the Valuation Period and the number of Put Shares shall be determined for a particular put as the Investment Amount divided by the Purchase Price. If the number of Estimated Put Shares (Investment Amount divided by Initial Pricing) initially delivered to the Investor is greater than the number of Put Shares (Investment Amount divided by Purchase Price) purchased by the Investor pursuant to such Put, then, within two trading days following the end of the Valuation Period, the Investor shall deliver to the Company any excess Estimated Put Shares associated with such put. If the number of Estimated Put Shares (Investment Amount divided by Initial Pricing) delivered to the Investor is less than the Put Shares purchased by the Investor pursuant to a put, then within two trading days following the end of the Valuation Period the Company shall deliver to the Investor by wire transfer of immediately available funds equal to the difference between the Estimated Put Shares and the Put Shares issuable pursuant to such put.



The Put Amount Requested pursuant to any single Put Notice must have an aggregate value of at least $25,000, and cannot exceed the lesser of (i) $250,000, or (ii) 150% of the average daily trading value of the common units in the five trading days immediately preceding the Put Notice.



In order to deliver a Put Notice, certain conditions set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement must be met, as provided therein. In addition, the Company is prohibited from delivering a Put Notice if: (i) the sale of Put Shares pursuant to such Put Notice would cause the Company to issue and sell to the Investor, or the Investor to acquire or purchase, a number of shares of the Company’s common units that, when aggregated with all shares of common units purchased by the Investor pursuant to all prior Put Notices issued under the Equity Purchase Agreement, would exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount; or (ii) the issuance of the Put Shares would cause the Company to issue and sell to Investor, or the Investor to acquire or purchase, an aggregate number of shares of common units that would result in the Investor beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common units (the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”).










If the value of the Put Shares based on the Purchase Price determined for a particular put would cause the Company to exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount, then within two trading days following the end of the Valuation Period the Investor shall return to the Company the surplus amount of Put Shares associated with such put. If the number of the Put Shares (Investment Amount divided by Purchase Price) determined for a particular put exceeds the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then within two trading days following the end of the Valuation Period the Investor shall return to the Company the surplus amount of Put Shares associated with such put. Concurrently, the Company shall return within two trading days following the end of the respective Valuation Period to the Investor, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the portion of the Investment Amount related to the portion of Put Shares exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.



Further pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed that if the SEC declares the Registration Statement for the Put Shares effective, then during the 12 month period immediately following the date the SEC declares the Registration Statement for the Put Shares effective, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of common units or common units equivalents for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), the Investor shall have the right to participate in up to an amount of the Subsequent Financing (that is not an “Exempt Issuance” as such term is defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement), equal to 50% of the Subsequent Financing (the “Participation Maximum”) on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in such Subsequent Financing; provided, however, where (i) the person or persons through or with whom such Subsequent Financing is proposed to be effected will not agree to such participation by the Investor and (ii) the Investor will not agree to finance the total amount of such Subsequent Financing in lieu of the person or persons through or with whom such Subsequent Financing is proposed to be effected, the Investor shall have no right to participate in such Subsequent Financing.



Further pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to reserve a sufficient number of shares of its common units for the Investor pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement and all other contracts between the Company and the Investor.



Registration Rights Agreement



On the Execution Date, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Investor pursuant to which the Company is obligated to file the Registration Statement to register the resale of the Put Shares. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company must (i) file the Registration Statement within 45 calendar days from the Execution Date, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), within 90 calendar days after the filing thereof, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until all of the Put Shares have been sold thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144.



Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to pay all reasonable expenses, other than sales or brokerage commissions, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, including, without limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company.



Corporate History



We were incorporated in New York on July 19, 2004, as Jobsinsite.com, Inc. On August 5, 2004, we changed our name to Jobsinsite, Inc. On June 18, 2009, we merged with a Delaware corporation and became Jobsinsite, Inc. On July 1, 2009, we filed articles of conversion with the secretary of state of Delaware and became Soleil Capital L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. On September 2, 2015, we changed our name to VPR Brands, LP. We are managed by Soleil Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.



Under our partnership agreement, we are authorized to issue an unlimited number of partnership interests for the consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by Soleil Capital Management LLC, our General Partner, without the approval of the unitholders. We may also issue additional partnership interests that, as determined by its General Partner, may have rights to distributions or special voting rights to which the Common Units are not entitled. The Common Unitholders do not have preemptive rights under the partnership agreement to acquire additional Common Units or other partnership interests. As of the date hereof, 88,804,035 common units, no par value per unit, are issued and outstanding and no Class A preferred units, no par value per unit, are issued and outstanding.










Since our inception, the Company has generated nominal revenues through the sale of software items related to the job search industry and in 2009, management actively explored opportunities to manage private capital. Specifically, the Company had plans to sponsor and manage limited partnerships organized for the purpose of exploring opportunities to acquire securities in secondary transactions of venture backed businesses and dispensing capital to seed stage venture capital opportunities. As a result of the Company’s new business direction and in an effort to establish operations in the venture capital and private equity industry, the Company has reorganized the business and restructured the Company as a public limited partnership. In 2013, management identified an opportunity to acquire a portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizers patents. In connection with this transaction the Company’s business objectives pivoted and the Company is now focusing its efforts on the electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer industry and is pursuing plans to commercialize and monetize its portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents. Prior to the Company’s decision to design, develop and market electronic cigarette e-liquids sold under the Helium brand in March 2016, the Company had designed, developed and marketed electronic cigarettes sold under the RED brand.



On December 27, 2013, the Company entered into a patent acquisition agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company and Guocheng “Greg” Pan, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase certain electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents owned and invented by Mr. Pan (the “Purchased Assets”). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the acquisition of the Purchased Assets, the Company issued to Mr. Pan (and certain of his designees) 10,501,700 common units representing limited partnership units of the Company and a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 common units representing limited partnership units of the Company. The warrants entitle Mr. Pan (or his designees) to purchase common units of the Company at $0.15 per common unit with an expiration date ten years from the effective date of the Purchase Agreement.



The patents were originally valued based on number of units issued, warrants issued, valuation of the traded stock at the time of issuance and similar patents sold during the year. Based on these assumptions, the Company has valued the assets purchased at approximately $5.5 million at the time of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company determined due to lack of sales and projected sales and completion in the industry the value of the patent should be significantly reduced. As a result, the Company has written off the entire patent.



In April 2015, the Company issued 25,000 of the Company’s common units to Gordon Hung in exchange for services for the Company valued at $12,500.



On May 29, 2015, the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Kevin Frija (“Frija Share Purchase Agreement”) for a private placement (“Private Placement”) of up to 50,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interests of the Company. The Private Placement was expected to occur in multiple tranches.

If at any time while the Note is outstanding, the Company enters into a transaction structured in accordance with, based upon, or related or pursuant to, in whole or in part, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act (covering certain exchange transactions), then a liquidated damages charge of 25% of the outstanding principal balance of the Note at that time will be assessed and will become immediately due and payable to DiamondRock, either in the form of cash payment or as an addition to the balance of the Note, as determined by mutual agreement of the Company and DiamondRock.



The Note also contains a right of first refusal such that, if at any time while the Note is outstanding, the Company has a bona fide offer of capital or financing from any 3rd party that the Company intends to act upon, then the Company must first offer such opportunity to DiamondRock to provide such capital or financing on the same terms.
