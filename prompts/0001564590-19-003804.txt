PULP AND PAPER
 
Our Manufacturing Operations
 We produce approximately 4 million metric tons of softwood, fluff and hardwood pulp at 12 of our 13 mills (Port Huron being a non-integrated paper mill). More than 50% of our pulp is consumed internally to manufacture paper, with the balance being sold as market pulp. We also purchase limited papergrade pulp from third parties for specific grades and to optimize the logistics of our pulp capacity while reducing transportation costs.
 We are the largest integrated manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. We have nine integrated pulp and paper mills and one non-integrated paper mill (eight in the United States and two in Canada), with an annual paper production capacity of approximately 3 million tons of uncoated freesheet paper. Our paper manufacturing operations are supported by 13 converting and forms manufacturing operations (including a network of 10 plants located offsite from our paper making operations). Approximately 77% of our paper production capacity is in the United States and the remaining 23% is located in Canada.
 We produce market pulp in excess of our internal requirements at our pulp and paper mills in Ashdown, Espanola, Hawesville, Windsor, Marlboro and Nekoosa. We also produce papergrade, fluff and specialty pulps at our three stand-alone pulp mills in Kamloops, Dryden and Plymouth. We can sell approximately 1.8 million metric tons of pulp per year depending on market conditions. Approximately 54% of our trade pulp production capacity is in the U.S., and the remaining 46% is located in Canada.

Our Raw Materials
 The manufacturing of pulp and paper requires wood fiber, chemicals and energy. We discuss these three major raw materials used in our manufacturing operations below.
 5


Wood Fiber
 United States pulp and paper mills
 The fiber used by our pulp and paper mills in the United States is softwood and hardwood, both readily available in the market from multiple third-party sources. The mills obtain fiber from a variety of sources, depending on their location. These sources include a combination of supply contracts, wood lot management arrangements, advance stumpage purchases and spot market purchases.
 Canadian pulp and paper mills
 The fiber used at our Windsor pulp and paper mill is hardwood originating from a variety of sources, including purchases on the open market in Canada and the United States, contracts with Quebec wood producers’ marketing boards, public land where we have wood supply allocations and from Domtar’s private lands. The softwood and hardwood fiber for our Espanola pulp and paper mill and the softwood fiber for our Dryden pulp mill, are obtained from third parties, directly or indirectly from public lands and through designated wood supply allocations. The fiber used at our Kamloops pulp mill is all softwood, originating mostly from third-party sawmill operations in the southern-interior part of British Columbia.
 Cutting rights on public lands related to our pulp and paper mills in Canada represent about 1.5 million cubic meters of softwood and 0.8 million cubic meters of hardwood per year. Access to harvesting of fiber on public lands in Ontario and Quebec is subject to licenses and review by the respective governmental authorities.
 During 2018, the cost of wood fiber relating to our Pulp and Paper segment comprised approximately 20% of the total consolidated cost of sales.
 Chemicals
 We use various chemical compounds in our pulp and paper manufacturing operations that we purchase, primarily on a centralized basis, through contracts varying between one and ten years in length to ensure product availability. Most of the contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions. For pulp manufacturing, we use numerous chemicals including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, lime and peroxide. For paper manufacturing, we also use several chemical products including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, optical brighteners, dyes and aluminum sulfate.
 During 2018, the cost of chemicals relating to our Pulp and Paper segment comprised approximately 12% of the total consolidated cost of sales.
 Energy
 Our operations produce and consume substantial amounts of energy. Our primary energy sources include: biomass, natural gas and electricity. Approximately 72% of the total energy required to manufacture our products comes from renewable fuels such as bark and spent pulping liquor, generated as byproducts from our manufacturing processes. The remainder of the energy comes from smaller amounts of other fossil fuels and purchased steam procured under supply contracts. Under most of these contracts, suppliers are committed to provide quantities within pre-determined ranges that provide us with our needs for a particular type of fuel at a specific facility. Most of these contracts have pricing that fluctuate based on prevailing market conditions. Biomass and fossil fuels are consumed primarily to produce steam that is used in the manufacturing process and, to a lesser extent, to provide direct heat used in the chemical recovery process.
 We own cogenerating assets at all of our integrated pulp and paper mills, as well as hydro assets at three locations: Espanola, Nekoosa and Rothschild. These generating assets produce approximately 72% of the electricity requirements of this business segment, with the balance supplied from local utilities. Electricity is primarily used to drive motors, pumps and other equipment, as well as provide lighting.  
 During 2018, net energy costs relating to our Pulp and Paper segment comprised approximately 5% of the total consolidated cost of sales.
 Our Transportation
 Transportation of raw materials, wood fiber, chemicals and pulp into our mills is mostly done by rail and trucks, although barges are used in certain circumstances. We rely strictly on third parties for the transportation of our pulp and paper products between our mills, converting operations, distribution centers and customers. Our paper products are shipped mostly by truck and logistics are managed 
 6


centrally in collaboration with each location. Our pulp is either shipped by vessel, rail or truck depending on destination and customer preference. We work with all major railroads and approximately 350 trucking companies in the United States and Canada. Service agreements are typically negotiated on an annual basis. We pay diesel fuel surcharges which vary depending on the mode of transportation used, and the cost of diesel fuel.
 During 2018, outbound transportation costs relating to our Pulp and Paper segment comprised approximately 11% of the total consolidated cost of sales.
 Our Product Offering and Go-to-Market Strategy
 Paper
 Our uncoated freesheet papers are categorized into both communication papers and specialty and packaging papers. Communication papers are further categorized into business papers and commercial printing and publishing papers.
 Our business papers include copy and electronic imaging papers, which are used with inkjet and laser printers, photocopiers and plain-paper fax machines, as well as computer papers, preprinted forms and digital papers. These products are primarily for office and home use. Business papers accounted for approximately 50% of our shipments of paper products in 2018.
 Our commercial printing and publishing papers include uncoated freesheet papers, such as offset papers and opaques. These uncoated freesheet grades are used in sheet and roll fed offset presses across the spectrum of commercial printing end-uses, including digital printing. Our publishing papers include tradebook and lightweight uncoated papers used primarily in book publishing applications such as textbooks, dictionaries, catalogs, magazines, hard cover novels and financial documents. These products also include base papers that are converted into finished products, such as envelopes, tablets, business forms and data processing/computer forms. Commercial printing and publishing papers accounted for approximately 32% of our shipments of paper products in 2018.
 Our specialty and packaging papers includes papers used for thermal printing, flexible packaging, food packaging, medical packaging, medical gowns and drapes, sandpaper backing, carbonless printing, labels and other papers used for coating and laminating applications. We also manufacture papers for industrial and specialty applications including carrier papers, treated papers, security papers and specialized printing and converting applications. These specialty and packaging papers accounted for approximately 18% of our shipments of paper products in 2018. These grades of papers require a certain amount of innovation and agility in the manufacturing system.

PERSONAL CARE
 
Our Operations
 Our Personal Care business consists of the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of absorbent hygiene products, including adult incontinence and infant diaper products. We are one of the leading suppliers of adult incontinence products sold into North America and Europe, servicing institutional and consumer channels, marketed primarily under our Attends®, IncoPack®, Indasec® and Reassure® brands, in addition to our customers’ brands. 
 We currently operate six manufacturing facilities, with each having the ability to produce multiple product categories. At our Jesup facility, we have research and development capabilities and production lines which manufacture high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated absorbent cores and we also have research and development activities in our divisional headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina. We operate in the United States and in Europe.
 On November 1, 2018, we announced a margin improvement plan within our Personal Care segment. As part of this plan, we announced the permanent closure of our Waco, Texas, manufacturing and distribution facility, the relocation of certain of our manufacturing assets and a workforce reduction of 214 full time employees as well as certain temporary positions across the division. The Waco, Texas facility is expected to cease operations in the third quarter of 2019.
 Our Industry Dynamics
 Aging population
 We compete in an industry with fundamental drivers for long-term growth. The worldwide aging population suggests that adult incontinence will become much more prevalent over the next several decades, as baby boomers enter their senior years and medical advances continue to extend the average lifespan. By the year 2030, approximately one billion people worldwide are estimated to be 65 years old or older, representing 12% of the projected total world population. 
 Increased healthcare spending
 While we are expected to benefit from the overall increase in healthcare spending due to an aging population, the pressure to limit public spending on healthcare may impact overall consumption or the channels in which consumption occurs.
 Infant products
 We compete within the competitive store brand segment of infant diapers and training pants. Future demand growth based on birth rate and demographic trends is forecasted to be limited in North America and Europe. The importance of the category to key retailers is expected to remain strong given the purchasing power and strategic importance of the infant diaper shopper. Today, our business is focused on securing multiyear contracts with large retailers that control the majority of volume, leading to intense competition with other manufacturers in the industry. 
 We believe that our product assortment provides our customers with the complete bundle of products at a scale required to meet their national distribution requirements.
 Our Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process are fluff pulp, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers. A significant portion of the fluff pulp used in our Personal Care business is supplied internally from our Pulp and Paper business. The majority of our nonwoven and super absorbent polymers are purchased centrally based on multiyear contracts with pricing that fluctuates with market conditions. Other raw materials used in our manufacturing process include polypropylene film, elastics and adhesives which are also purchased with multiyear contracts.
Our Product Offering and Go-to-Market Strategy
 Our products, which include branded and private label briefs, protective underwear, underpads, pads and washcloths, as well as baby diapers, youth pants and infant training pants, are available in a variety of sizes, differing performance levels and product attributes. Our broad product portfolio covers most price points across each category.
 9


We serve the healthcare, retail and direct-to-consumer channels. Through the utilization of our flexible production platform, manufacturing expertise and efficient supply chain management, we believe that we are able to provide a complete and high-quality line of products to customers across all channels, under our own brands or those of our customers. We maintain a direct sales organization in the United States and certain European countries.
 Our Product Development
 We currently offer a comprehensive, full suite of products, and we continue to focus on product development to improve products for our customers. We continue to explore materials, designs and processes that will allow us to manufacture products that absorb wetness more quickly, reduce skin dryness and improve containment.
OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND FINANCIAL PRIORITIES
 As a leading fiber-based technology company, Domtar is focused on driving innovation, enhancing our operating platforms, and delivering high quality products. To further bolster our position and drive enhanced value for our stockholders, Domtar is focused on four key business objectives: (1) driving value in our Pulp and Paper business through strategic investment; (2) building on our core competencies in wood fiber to diversify and expand Domtar’s footprint in growth markets and industries; (3) maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for investments in growth opportunities and rewards stockholders with capital returns; and (4) operating with a focus on environmental responsibility and sustainability. We are confident that the continued focus on these objectives will bolster the competitive position of our business and drive value for our stakeholders, including stockholders, customers and employees.
 Driving value in the Pulp and Paper business. Domtar’s Pulp and Paper business remains an important part of our growth plan, and we have strategies and operating priorities designed to maximize the value of the business. Our key priorities include: increasing productivity in our pulp business, pursuing new sources of paper consumption, pursuing asset repurposing opportunities and operating an optimal portfolio of strategic assets. We believe that execution on these priorities will enable Domtar to expand into complementary growth areas and protect its market position in Pulp and Paper.
 Expanding into areas of growth and leveraging our fiber expertise. We are focused on optimizing and expanding our operations in markets with positive demand dynamics through investments for organic growth, the repurposing of assets and strategic acquisitions. Domtar has a history of proactively adapting to changing market conditions, and today, we are repositioning the Company towards areas of growth. We are well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities in the wood fiber market. The Company already has the financial resources, infrastructure, raw materials, technologies and expertise necessary to deliver new products. We believe that we have built a strong foundation for diversification and continue to make important, but disciplined, progress. 
 Maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for investments in growth opportunities and rewards stockholders with capital returns. We believe in a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation, and we are committed to deploying capital only to the areas that will achieve the best possible return for our stockholders. Domtar’s free cash flow allows us to invest in growth opportunities and maintain a strong and flexible financial position for operating and strategic initiatives, while still returning capital to our stockholders. To continue generating free cash flow, we are focused on assigning our capital expenditures effectively and minimizing working capital requirements by reducing discretionary spending, reviewing procurement costs and pursuing the balance of production and inventory control.
 Operating responsibly on behalf of all of Domtar’s stakeholders. We try to make a positive difference every day by pursuing sustainable growth, valuing relationships, and responsibly managing our resources. We aim to care for our customers, end-users and stakeholders in the communities where we operate, all seeking assurances that resources are managed in a sustainable manner. We strive to provide these assurances by certifying our distribution and manufacturing operations and measuring our performance against internationally recognized benchmarks. Domtar is committed to the responsible use of forest resources across our operations, and we are enrolled in programs and initiatives to encourage landowners to pursue certification to improve their market access and increase their revenue opportunities. We believe that each of these initiatives also creates value for our stockholders and is part of our larger business strategy and commitment to environmental sustainability. 
OUR COMPETITION
 The markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers.
 In the paper business, our paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas, except in highly specialized papers or customized products. In uncoated freesheet, we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering, service 
 10


solutions and competitively priced paper products, which include an extensive offering of high quality Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”)-certified paper products. While we have a leading position in the North American uncoated freesheet market, we also compete with other paper grades, including coated freesheet, and with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As the use of these alternative products continues to grow, we continue to see a decrease in the overall demand for paper products. All of our pulp and paper manufacturing facilities are located in the United States or in Canada where we sell approximately 82% of our products. Domtar is the largest of the five manufacturers of uncoated freesheet papers in North America that represent approximately 80% of the total production capacity. On a global basis, there are hundreds of manufacturers that produce and sell uncoated freesheet paper. The level of competitive pressures from foreign producers in the North American market is highly dependent upon exchange rates, particularly the rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro as well as the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real.
 The market pulp we sell is fluff, softwood or hardwood pulp. The pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the basis of access to low-cost wood fiber, product quality and competitively priced pulp products. The fluff pulp we sell is used in absorbent products, incontinence products, diapers and feminine hygiene products. The softwood and hardwood pulp we sell is primarily slow growth northern bleached softwood and hardwood kraft, and we produce specialty engineered pulp grades with a pre-determined mix of wood species. Our softwood and hardwood pulps are sold to customers who make a variety of products for specialty paper, packaging, tissue and industrial applications, and customers who make printing and writing grades. We also seek product differentiation through the certification of our pulp mills to the FSC chain-of-custody standard and the procurement of FSC-certified virgin fiber. All of our market pulp production capacity is located in the United States or in Canada, and we sell approximately 58% of our pulp to other countries.
 For the adult incontinence business, competition is primarily faced across four major product categories: protective underwear, pads, briefs and underpads, with customers served through the healthcare, retail (mass retailers, dollar stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs), and direct to consumer channels. The retail channel in Europe is more fragmented than in North America, with a mix of larger chains and smaller players. Approximately 74% of institutional and homecare expenditures are reimbursed by governments in Western Europe. 
 For the infant diaper business, competition is primarily across three major product categories: diapers, training pants and youth pants with customers served through the retail (mass retailers, dollar stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs) and direct to consumer channels. In North America, branded labels represent the majority of the infant market with the top two manufacturers supplying a significant portion of the branded demand. The remaining supply is represented by private label, and is split among the competition. In Europe, the top manufacturer supplies approximately 50% of the demand with branded labels, and the remainder is represented by private label. Products are marketed in multiple channels: mass retailers, dollar stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs, internet and home health care. 
 In both the adult incontinence and infant diaper businesses, the principal methods and elements of competition remain brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price and marketing and distribution capabilities. Growing competitive market pressures in the healthcare and retail markets in recent years, including the entry of new competitors in the private label category, excess industry capacity and the pressure to limit public healthcare spending are resulting in lower than previously anticipated sales and operating margins.
 OUR EMPLOYEES
 We have approximately 10,000 employees, of which approximately 60% are employed in the United States, 28% in Canada and 12% in Europe. Approximately 44% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, generally on a facility-by-facility basis. Certain agreements will expire in 2019 and others will expire between 2020 and 2022.
OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
 Domtar aims to deliver value to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities by viewing our business decisions within the larger context of sustainability. We take a long-term view on managing natural resources for the future. We strive to minimize waste and encourage recycling. We aim to have the highest standards for ethical conduct, for caring about the health and safety of each other, and for maintaining the environmental quality in the communities where we live and work. We value the partnerships we have formed with non-governmental organizations and believe they make us a better company. We focus on agility to respond to new opportunities, and we are committed to turning innovation into value creation. By embracing sustainability as our operating philosophy, we seek to internalize the fact that the choices we have and the impact of the decisions we make on our stakeholders are all interconnected. We believe that our business and the people and communities who depend on us are better served as we weave this focus on sustainability into the things we do.
 11


Domtar executes this commitment to sustainability at every level and every location across the company. With the support of the Board of Directors, our Management Committee empowers senior managers from manufacturing, technology, finance, sales and marketing and corporate staff functions to regularly come together and establish key sustainability performance metrics, and to routinely assess and report on progress. We have a vice-president position to help lead this effort, allowing the company’s organizational structure to better reflect the priority the company places on sustainable performance. We believe that weaving sustainability into our business better positions Domtar for the future.
 OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
 Our business is subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations in the United States and other countries where we have operations, relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing wood harvesting, air emissions, climate change, waste water discharges, storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, contaminated sites, landfill operation and closure obligations and health and safety matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our business. We may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable environmental requirements, possibly leading to civil or criminal fines, penalties or enforcement actions, including those that could result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs, such as the installation of additional pollution control equipment or other remedial actions.
 Compliance with environmental laws and regulations involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. Additional information regarding environmental matters is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Note 21 “Commitments and Contingencies” and in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section of Critical accounting estimates and policies, caption “Environmental matters and asset retirement obligations”.
