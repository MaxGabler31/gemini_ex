ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 CCNB1 was a blank check company incorporated on January 14, 2020 (inception) as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company’s sponsor was CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
 On April 28, 2020, CCNB1 consummated the IPO of 41,400,000 units, including the issuance of 5,400,000 units as a result of the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $414.0 million. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, CCNB1 consummated a private placement of 10,280,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant to the sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $10.280 million. Each private placement warrant is exercisable for one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement, $414.0 million ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO and certain of the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of CCNB1’s public shareholders ("Trust Account"), until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $414.0 million held in the trust account.
 Prior to the Business Combination, CCNB1 neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. As described above in more detail under “Explanatory Note”, on February 4, 2021, E2open Holdings and CCNB1 completed the Business Combination contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, CCNB1 acquired a majority interest in E2open Holdings through a series of mergers, with E2open Holdings becoming a direct subsidiary of CCNB1. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and changed its name to “E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.”
 As of December 31, 2020 and prior to the Business Combination, CCNB1 had two executive officers and its executive offices were at 200 Park Avenue, 58th Floor, New York, New York 10166.
