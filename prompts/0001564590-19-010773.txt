ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 VIASPACE Inc. (“we”, “us”, “VIASPACE”, or the “Company”) was founded in July 1998. Our business involves renewable energy and is based on biomass, in particular our license to a dedicated energy crop with the trademark “Giant King® Grass” (“GKG”). Through a license for GKG we obtained from Guangzhou Inter-Pacific Arts Corp., a Chinese wholly-owned foreign enterprise registered in Guangdong province ("IPA China") which owned by VIASPACE Green Energy Inc. (“VGE”), we are able to commercialize GKG throughout the world, except for the People’s Republic of China (“China”) and the Republic of China (“Taiwan”).
 GKG can be burned in 100% biomass power plants to generate electricity; made into pellets that can be burned together with coal to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants; generate bio methane through anaerobic digestion, and can be used as a feedstock for low carbon liquid biofuels for transportation, biochemicals and bio plastics. Cellulosic ethanol, bio butanol and other liquid cellulosic biofuels, do not use corn or other food sources as feedstock. GKG can also be used as animal feed. GKG and other plants absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. When they are burned, they release the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is the same carbon dioxide that was removed from the atmosphere, and so this process is carbon neutral. Small amounts of fossil fuel are used by the farm equipment, transportation of GKG and fertilizer, so that the overall process of growing and burning GKG probably has some net carbon dioxide emissions, but much lower emissions than burning coal or other fossil fuels directly to create the same amount of energy. GKG has been independently tested by customers and been shown to have excellent energy content, high bio methane production, and the cellulosic sugar content needed for biofuels and biochemicals.

 Corporate History
 ViaSpace Technologies LLC (“ViaSpace LLC”) was founded in July 1998 as a private company to commercialize proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense. ViaSpace LLC had licensed patents, and software technology from California Institute of Technology (“Caltech”), which manages the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (“JPL”) for NASA. On June 22, 2005, ViaSpace LLC acquired the non-operating shell company Global-Wide Publication Ltd. (“GW”). GW was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 14, 2003. At the closing of the merger, GW was renamed VIASPACE Inc. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger and a recapitalization of the Company. VIASPACE became a public company on June 22, 2005.
Grass Business 
 We focus on GKG, a natural hybrid, non-genetically modified, fast-growing, perennial grass which we are growing as a dedicated energy crop that can be used to generate low carbon and renewable electricity by direct burning in a biomass power plant, and can be made into pellets that can replace some of the coal in existing power plants thus reducing carbon emissions. GKG may also be used to produce bio methane through anaerobic digestion and as a feedstock for non-food liquid biofuels such as bio ethanol and bio butanol. It can also be used as a feedstock for biochemicals and bio plastics. This perennial grass can grow up to 16 feet in height. It can be harvested at least twice a year in tropical and semitropical areas with a yield of up to 375 metric tons per hectare (freshly cut, referred to as wet yield). We believe that GKG has the highest yield of any crop. Note that one hectare (ha) is 10,000 square meters and equal to 2.47 US acres or approximately the size of two US football fields.
 GKG has been independently tested by multiple potential customers. Proximate and ultimate analyses are available as well as ash composition, biogas production test data and sugar composition, pretreatment and hydrolysis data are available. To our knowledge, the results have been positive and consistent. GKG has excellent energy content of 18.4 megajoules (MJ) per dry kilogram. Its chemical and physical properties are very similar to corn straw, which is material left behind from the corn plant after the ear of corn has been harvested. Corn straw is used as fuel in many biomass power plants, and a leading international biomass power provider, has declared GKG as suitable for their power plants. The bio methane production from GKG has been tested in three customer laboratories and shows the outstanding production of 91 liters of methane per kilogram of fresh grass. The methane can be used to generate clean electricity or can be burned to produce process heat. There are potentially thousands of biogas plants worldwide that could use GKG. A large European electric utility has tested GKG and examined prototype pellets. In addition to these current markets, GKG can be used as animal feed and has been tested for this purpose.
 GKG can also be used as a feedstock to make cellulosic biofuels such as bio ethanol, bio butane and green gasoline. GKG has previously been tested as a potential feedstock for producing biofuels, biochemicals and bio plastics through fermentation method. Laboratory results from these tests show that GKG has almost identical composition including sugar content as corn straw or wheat straw which are the agricultural waste products often targeted as a feedstock for cellulosic biofuels. The projected bio ethanol yield is approximately 80 gallons per dry ton of GKG based on these tests.

Corn straw and wheat straw are the by-products after food production. This agricultural waste material can only be collected after the food is harvested which means that the feedstock supply is very seasonal and must be stored for a long time--up to one year-- between harvests. To support a single biofuel or power plant, agricultural waste must be collected from farms up to 50 or more miles away. Giant King Grass is a high yield dedicated nonfood energy crop that can be harvested at any time in a tropical or subtropical climate. If the biofuel or power plant is co-located with a GKG plantation, the collection radius will only be about three miles. The high yield and logistical advantages mean that GKG can be grown and delivered to a co-located plant at a substantially lower price than currently paid for agricultural waste. The largest operating cost of a biomass power plant or biofuels plant is the cost of the fuel or feedstock, and the low cost and high quality of GKG are of major interest to these customers.
 Energy pellets made from dried GKG can be used as a replacement for coal in electricity generating power plants. Reports by the U.S. Department of Energy state that 15% to 20% of coal used in the power plant may be replaced by burning grass in an existing power plant with only minor modifications. This process called co-firing allows utilization of the large capital investment in existing coal fired power plants while reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 15 to 20%. GKG and other biomass have lower mercury, arsenic and sulfur emissions than coal.
 During 2016-2018, we entered into Giant King Grass collaborative supply agreements with partners in the Philippines, South Korea, Florida, Louisiana and California. We have shipped Giant King Grass to these states/countries as part of the collaborative agreements. The first phase for each of these partners is for the joint operation of test plots to establish that GKG grows well in the area and optimal agronomic practices are developed. If this initial phase is completed successfully, each partner would then expand the initial growing site as they develop more land to grow GKG. Each partner has different planned uses for the Giant King Grass.
 We grow Giant King Grass in Hawaii. This location serves as a nursery for our Giant King Grass and a place from which we can harvest Giant King Grass seedlings and send it to customers in the US and throughout the world.
 We plan to expand our grass business into other areas of the world, and are in discussions with developers of power plants, pellet mills and biogas facilities throughout the world other than China and Taiwan.
 Having a reliable source of feedstock is critical for all energy users of biomass. Today, power plants and pellet mills use agricultural and forestry waste such as corn straw, wheat straw, rice husks and wood waste as feedstock. Increasing demand for biomass has caused the price of this agricultural and forestry waste to rise dramatically and in some places it is in short supply. Biomass supply issues have caused some power plants to become unprofitable, idle or abandoned. We believe that dedicated energy crops such as GKG may be necessary and advantageous for successful operation of biomass processing facilities. Agricultural waste will still be used, but the dedicated energy crop could provide a reliable and consistent base. The feedstock uncertainty issue may contribute to the difficulties that many proposed biomass power plant and biogas projects have been unable to obtain financing. A dedicated energy crop may help alleviate this obstacle.
 Because of its high yield, GKG provides feedstock with less use of land and we believe therefore lower costs compared to its alternatives. Other energy crops providing half the yield will require twice the land and therefore land and other costs could be nearly doubled.
 Another major advantage of GKG is that it can be harvested at any time-- particularly in a tropical or subtropical area. When corn straw is used, there is a delay for the corn to mature before any feedstock is produced. Then at the corn harvest, a lot of feedstock is available all at one time. This corn straw has to be collected, stored and used until the next corn harvest which will be one year later. This creates a major logistics issue. If the climate permits, GKG can be planted so that it matures continuously and allows just-in-time harvesting.
 Higher food prices have led to food shortages around the globe. This argument has resonated with many world leaders and resulted in a global effort to derive biofuels from plants that are not in the human food chain. Using such plants as fuel sources helps avoid the political issue and perception that prices are rising because foods are being diverted for use as biofuels. These plants are called cellulosic biofuels.
 Cellulosic biofuels are based on nonfood plants including grass, shrubs and trees. These plants do not have a lot of sugar and cannot be fermented directly like corn. They do, however, have a lot of cellulose in their leaves, stalks and branches which contain carbon and hydrogen which can then be converted into ethanol called cellulosic ethanol. GKG has been recently tested and shown to have potential for producing cellulosic biofuels including ethanol and for making biochemicals and bio plastics using a fermentation process.
 We have three revenue models for GKG: 1. contract plantation establishment, support and licensing for a customer; 2. collaborative agreements to establish a test plot in the customer’s location to determine that GKG grows sufficiently for the customer to use in their particular application; and 3. consulting agreement services for customers considering the establishment of a grass plantation in their particular country or location.

Under a contract plantation establishment and licensing model, the customer would provide the land, labor and management and be responsible for growing GKG. We will provide initial seedlings, crop management services and knowledge transfer for a negotiated price. In addition, there would be an ongoing license fee based on grass production.
 Management believes both models will be important contributors to our revenue streams. We believe all our revenues initially will result from the integrated plantation & end-user model. Rapid global expansion requires local joint venture partners that have land and labor, but lack the energy crop and the expertise to grow it. The contract plantation establishment and licensing model with joint venture partners will be used for most of these projects. We may also serve as a developer for integrated Giant King Grass plantations and bioenergy projects.
 Other VIASPACE Projects
 We retain a worldwide nonexclusive license to certain patents and patent applications in the areas of interactive radio technology; however, we are devoting no attention to this license.
Research and Development
 We did not record any research and development activities in 2018 or 2017. If we do in the future, it will be expensed as incurred.
 Competition
 Many companies, universities and research laboratories worldwide are investigating grass as a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol and other applications. Monsanto is an example of a large company focusing on grass as a biofuel. Ceres is an example of a company focusing on biomass and grass in particular. Much of the competition is looking at miscanthus or switchgrass. These grasses are suitable for temperate areas. Much of the competition also is focused on selling seeds. GKG is a natural hybrid that is not genetically modified nor generally available, and to our knowledge no one else is growing GKG besides VIASPACE Green Energy, Inc. (“VGE”), as a commercial crop. Based on publicly available data on switchgrass and miscanthus, compared to our data on GKG, we believe that GKG has higher productivity than these and other competing grasses. GKG is most suitable for tropical and subtropical areas, which are the focus of our efforts. Because GKG is propagated by seedlings and not by seeds, it is not an invasive species. We are focusing on projects involving growing the grass and securing long-term supply contracts for biofuel production, as a replacement for coal and electricity generation, and as animal feed. With long-term supply contracts and joint ventures, we plan to capture these recurring revenue streams.
 Other grasses such as alfalfa are suitable for animal feed and are also competitors of GKG.
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research, human resources, and product development capabilities. In addition, many of our competitors have greater experience in marketing such technologies and products and greater potential to develop revenue streams. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop and expand their competing product offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to marketing and sales of their products and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.
 Customers
 We have a relatively small number of customers that have planted Giant King Grass. We believe this concentration of sales made to a small number of customers will continue in the near future. A loss of any customer could significantly reduce our future revenues.
Intellectual Property
 On or about October 20, 2008, IPA China entered into an agreement with China Gate whereby VGE purchased seedlings of GKG and other grasses from China Gate and the parties agreed to assist each other in growing, developing and commercializing GKG. The agreement does not limit IPA China’s right to grow, harvest and market the grass anywhere in the world. No term was specified in the agreement. To our knowledge, China Gate has not entered into similar agreements with any other party.
 On September 30, 2012, IPA China granted to VGE a reciprocal worldwide license for GKG, not to exceed the rights IPA China had in GKG.  Additionally, on September 30, 2012, VIASPACE and VGE entered into a Supply, License and Commercialization Agreement (“License Agreement”) pursuant to which VGE granted to VIASPACE a nontransferable, royalty-bearing exclusive license to commercialize Giant King Grass everywhere in the world other than China and Taiwan. Additionally, the License Agreement allows VIASPACE to use the Giant King Grass intellectual property and VIASPACE Green Energy trade name in connection with its efforts to commercialize Giant King Grass.
 Executed on April 4, 2016 and effective as of March 28, 2016, we entered into the Global Supply, License, and Commercialization Agreement (the “New Agreement”) with VGE and IPA China.

Prior to the New Agreement, IPA China and VGE had entered into a certain Supply and Commercialization Agreement dated September 30, 2012 regarding a license and supply arrangement between IPA China and VGE regarding Giant King Grass (“IPA-VGE Agreement”). In turn, we also entered into a certain Supply and Commercialization Agreement dated September 30, 2012 with VGE regarding a license and supply arrangement between VGE and us regarding Giant King Grass (“VGE-VIASPACE Agreement”).
 Under the New Agreement, we terminated the VGE-VIASPACE Agreement with VGE and IPA China directly granted us an exclusive, perpetual license to commercialize its intellectual property rights to three (3) types of high yield, non-genetically modified grasses (“Three GK Grasses”) throughout the world except Cambodia, People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore (“VIASPACE Territory”). It and VGE agreed to subordinate the terms of the IPA-VGE Agreement to the terms of the New Agreement. IPA China also granted us the right to use and market the name “Giant King Grass” and other related names.
 We would owe royalty payments on the Net Sales of the Three GK Grasses. This license would be sublicenseable in the VIASPACE Territory. IPA China held all rights of ownership to the intellectual property relating to the Three GK Grasses. The Company would own any grasses resulting from any modifications or improvements to the Three GK Grasses. IPA China would use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its intellectual property rights. We would use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Three GK Grasses throughout the VIASPACE Territory.
