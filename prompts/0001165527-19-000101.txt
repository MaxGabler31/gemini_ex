On June 18, 2018, we changed our name from "First American Silver Corp." to “Century Cobalt Corp.”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Century Cobalt Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name. We changed the name of our company to reflect the new direction of our company in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing cobalt mineral properties. Our name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Markets at the opening of trading on June 18, 2018, on which date we adopted the new stock symbol "CCOB”.
 
OUR CURRENT BUSINESS
 
On August 7, 2018, we entered into an assignment agreement with Oriental Rainbow Group Ltd., in regards to the acquisition of certain mineral claims in Lemhi County, Idaho known as the “Idaho Cobalt Belt”.
 
Oriental Rainbow and Plateau Ventures LLC had entered into a purchase agreement dated September 4, 2017, wherein Oriental Rainbow had acquired from Plateau a 100% interest in the property, subject to certain subsequent payments and conditions.  The claims comprising the property (649 claims) initially totaled approximately 12,980 acres, subject to an option under the purchase agreement for the acquisition of additional claims.  Such option had been exercised with additional claims acquired, resulting in a total of 695 claims comprising approximately 13,900 acres.
 
Oriental Rainbow has assigned its interest in the property to us in consideration for 2,500,000 restricted shares of common stock (the “Consideration Shares”). We have assumed all of Oriental Rainbow’s obligations under the purchase agreement, which material obligations include: the issuance of up to 500,000 restricted shares of common stock to Plateau upon listing on a recognized stock exchange; paying pending BLM fees for the claims in the amount of $108,000; and paying Plateau $1,000,000 in four equal staged payments upon completion of a positive feasiblity study on the property.
 
Century Cobalt’s, acreage, known as the “Emperium Cobalt Project,” as noted above totals 13,900 Acres  / 5,625 Hectares, making it larger than the combined land claims of the 5 largest publicly traded companies currently active in the Idaho Cobalt Belt. The project is located approximately 16 miles (26 km) southwest of Salmon, Idaho.
 
Property Information:
 
The Idaho Cobalt Belt is a northwest-southeast trending belt of cobalt- and copper-bearing mineral deposits and prospects.
 
The belt is at least 40 miles long (64 km) and up to 6 miles (10 km) wide.
 
Between 1902 and 1968, millions of tonnes of ore were mined in the Idaho Cobalt Belt within the Blackbird Mining area.
 
Total past production from the Blackbird Mine (to the immediate west of our Emperium Cobalt Project) was roughly 2.4 million tons of ore containing 19 thousand tons of cobalt, with the mine reaching its maximum production in 1958 at annual output of 2,000 tons cobalt.
 
As the only primary cobalt mine in the US to date, the mine site became a superfund site and was cleaned up in the 1990s.
 
2019 Exploration Program
 
The company completed a preliminary 2018 exploration program in the Idaho Cobalt Belt. During the 2018 campaign, the location of two known historic mineral prospects on our property were confirmed and sampled.  In addition, a number of previously unknown prospects were also discovered by our exploration team and sampled. By 2018 year-end the Century field crew had collected over 800 soil samples and 150 rock samples, with the majority of the samples being sent for analysis to ALS Labs in Reno (NV). The results so far include:

Rock Samples:
 
0.1525% Co, 3.27 g/t Au, 27.7 g/t Ag, 4.38% Cu
 
149ppm Co, 12.9 g/t Au, 162 g/t Ag, 1.224% Cu
 
255 ppm Co, 4.89 g/t Au, 80.3 g/t Ag, 17.15% Cu
 
337ppm Co, 1.2 g/t Au, 62.2 g/t Ag, 16.85% Cu
 
6.93 g/t Au, 2690 g/t Ag, 2.62 % Cu, 5.53% Pb, 3.54% Zn
 
0.769 g/t Au, 522 g/t Ag, 13.15% Pb, 12% Zn
 
Soils Samples:
 
0.1175% Co, 11 ppm Cu and 299 ppm As
 
1.525% Cu, 0.2 g/t Au, 5.8g/t Ag and 1430 ppm As
 
0.998% Cu, 5 g/t Ag and 1630 ppm As
 
0.628% Cu, 0.188 g/t Au, 1.5g/t Ag and 1320 ppm As
 
0.278% Cu, 0.28 g/t Au, 13g/t Ag and 2180 ppm As
 
Cobalt Plus Co-Products
 
These early results confirm the strong Cobalt potential of the properties, while the findings for Copper (Cu), Gold (Au) and Silver (Ag), along with Lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn) suggests co-products that could ultimately positively impact project economics.  Additionally, Arsenic (As), (like cobalt, a US Government-designated Critical Mineral), will be assessed as a potential co-product. Essential for the production of Gallium-Arsenide semiconductor chips, Arsenic is a key raw material for solar panels, telecoms applications, infrared and optical applications.
2019 Exploration Program
 
The company has recently completed a Satellite Thermal Study over its entire licence area, the results of which will be integrated into the company’s geological database and combined with the soil and rock samples to further define areas of interest.
 
To commence the company’s 2019 exploration program, a drone-mounted Magnetic Survey is planned in the coming months that will further enhance the Company’s growing understanding of the geology, structure and mineral potential of the licence area.  The company anticipates following up on a number of the promising targets generated so far, to identify those that warrant further investigation by trenching and drilling.
 
COMPETITION
 
The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new exploration-stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders.
 
 6
 
Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.
 
We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs.
 
General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international political conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration.
 
In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring or developing profitable mineral properties or interests, and we cannot give any assurance that suitable oil and gas properties or interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or development. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the mineral exploration industry by:
 
 
· | keeping our costs low;
--+-----------------------


· | relying on the strength of our management’s contacts; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Any operations at our cobalt properties will be subject to various federal and state laws and regulations in the United States which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will be required to obtain those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. There are no current orders or directions relating to us or to our cobalt properties with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become so prohibitive that we may decide to not proceed with exploration, development, or mining operations on any of our mineral properties. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or operation of property.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.
