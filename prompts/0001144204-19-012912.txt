Item 1.   Business 
History 
 We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998 for the purpose of operating and acquiring rural local exchange carriers, which we refer to as RLECs. Since 1999, we have acquired eleven RLEC businesses, four of which serve contiguous territories in north central Alabama; three of which serve territories adjacent to either Portland or Bangor, Maine; and one each serving a portion of western Massachusetts, central Missouri, western Vermont and southern West Virginia. In addition to traditional telephone services, we provide a variety of unregulated telecommunications services in all of our RLEC territories, including internet data lines and long distance services. We have also acquired three facilities-based competitive local exchange carriers, which we refer to as CLECs, which offer services primarily to business and enterprise customers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts and have historically operated under the trade name OTT Communications. The Company completed an initial public offering in December 2004 at which time it converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Otelco Inc. In 2018, we transitioned to using the brand name Otelco in all locations where we provide service. 
 Our RLEC companies trace their history to the introduction of telecommunication services in the areas they serve over 100 years ago. We are able to leverage our long-standing relationship with our local service customers by offering them a broad suite of telecommunications and information services, such as long distance, internet/broadband data access and, in some areas, video and security, thereby increasing customer loyalty and revenue per customer. Each RLEC qualifies as a rural telephone company under the Federal Communications Act of 1934, which we refer to as the Communications Act. We are currently exempt from certain costly interconnection requirements imposed on larger incumbent local telephone companies by the Communications Act. Although this exemption helps us maintain our strong competitive position, we have direct competition in the majority of our RLEC markets, primarily where a cable provider also serves the same market. In addition, the larger wireless carriers have deployed their networks in our markets. 
 In Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, our facilities-based CLEC serves primarily business and enterprise customers, utilizing both owned and leased fiber as its backbone network. In nearly two decades of operations, the CLEC has grown to serve over 2,000 customers. 
 Acquisitions have represented a significant part of our growth. From 1999 to 2003, we acquired four contiguous RLECs in north central Alabama. In 2004, we acquired an RLEC in central Missouri. In 2006, we acquired an RLEC adjacent to Bangor, Maine, and a CLEC serving the state of Maine. In 2008, we acquired RLECs adjacent to Portland, Maine, in western Massachusetts and southern West Virginia, as well as two CLECs serving customers in Maine and New Hampshire. In 2011, we acquired an RLEC in western Vermont. In 2014, we acquired the assets of Reliable Networks of Maine, LLC, a Portland, Maine-based provider of cloud hosting and managed services for companies who rely on mission-critical software applications. The acquisition expanded our CLEC service offerings to include multi-tenancy hosting of vendor-agnostic email, database, web and industry vertical software applications, as well as related professional engineering services, which we refer to, collectively, as managed services.

Local Services 
 We are the sole provider of wireline voice telephone services in three of the eleven RLEC territories we serve. In seven territories, the incumbent cable provider also offers local services in portions of our territory. In Missouri, a local electric co-operative also offers local services in a portion of our territory. Local services enable customers to originate and receive telephone calls. The amount that we can charge a customer for certain basic voice services in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Vermont and West Virginia is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which we refer to as the APSC, the Maine Public Utilities Commission, which we refer to as the MPUC, the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Cable, which we refer to as the MDTC, the Missouri Public Service Commission, which we refer to as the MPSC, the Vermont Public Utilities Commission, which we refer to as the VPUC, and the West Virginia Public Service Commission, which we refer to as the WVPSC. We also have authority to provide service in New Hampshire from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, which we refer to as the NHPUC. The regulatory involvement in pricing varies by state and by type of service. In recent years, state commissions have relaxed regulation of most of our services. 
 Revenue derived from local services includes monthly recurring charges for voice lines providing local dial tone and calling features, including caller identification, call waiting, call forwarding and voicemail. We also receive revenue for providing long distance services to our customers, billing and collection services for other carriers under contract, and directory advertising. We provide local services on a retail basis to residential and business customers. With the high level of acceptance of local service bundles, a significant percentage of our customers receive a broad range of bundled services for a single, fixed monthly price. 
 We offer long distance telephone services to our RLEC local telephone customers. We provide long distance services on our own facilities or through services purchased from various long distance providers. The majority of our RLEC voice customers also subscribe to our long distance services. Our long distance business is an integral part of the bundles of services we provide to our RLEC customers. 
 In Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, our CLEC provides communications services tailored to business and enterprise customers, including specialized data and voice network configurations, to support their unique business requirements. Our fiber network allows us to offer our customers affordable and reliable voice and data solutions to support their business requirements and applications. 
 Network Access 
 Network access revenue relates primarily to services provided by us to long distance carriers in connection with their use of our facilities to originate and terminate interstate and intrastate long distance, or toll, telephone calls. As toll calls are generally billed to the customer originating the call, network access charges are applied in order to compensate each telecommunications company providing services relating to the call. Network access charges apply to both interstate and intrastate calls. As of December 31, 2016, all eleven of our RLECs received Interstate Common Line Support, which we refer to as ICLS, revenue from

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 the Universal Service Fund, which we refer to as the USF, and three of our RLECs also received Universal Service Fund High Cost Loop, which we refer to as USF HCL, revenue. This revenue is included in our reported network access revenue. Beginning January 1, 2017, ICLS and USF HCL funding was replaced by Alternative Connect America Model, which we refer to as A-CAM, funding for ten of our RLECs. Our Vermont RLEC continues to receive USF HCL, and a revised form of ICLS called Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support, which we refer to as CAF BLS. 
  Intrastate Access Charges.   We generate intrastate access revenue when a long distance call, involving a long distance carrier, is originated and terminated within the same state. The interexchange carrier pays us an intrastate access payment for either terminating or originating the call. We record the details of the call through our carrier access billing system. Our access charges for our intrastate access services were historically set by state regulatory commissions. The Federal Communications Commission, which we refer to as the FCC, intercarrier compensation order released in October 2011, which we refer to as the FCC ICC Order, preempted the state commissions’ authority to set terminating intrastate access service rates. The FCC required companies with terminating access rates higher than interstate rates to reduce their terminating intrastate access rates to a rate equal to interstate access service rates by July 1, 2013, and to move to a “bill and keep” arrangement by July 1, 2020, which will eliminate access charges between carriers. The FCC ICC Order created the Connect America Fund, which we refer to as the CAF, to offset the RLECs’ resulting loss in intrastate terminating access revenues, but limited the yearly amount recovered to 95% of the previous year’s revenue requirement. There is no recovery mechanism for the lost revenue in our CLEC. 
  Interstate Access Charges.   We generate interstate access revenue when a long distance call originates from an area in a state served by one of our local exchange carriers and terminates outside of that state, or vice versa. We bill interstate access charges in a manner similar to intrastate access charges. Our RLEC interstate access charges are regulated by the FCC through our participation in tariffs filed by John Staurulakis Inc. The FCC regulates the prices local exchange carriers charge for access services in two ways: price caps and rate-of-return. All of our RLECs are rate-of-return carriers for purposes of interstate network access regulation. Interstate access revenue for rate-of-return carriers for non-FCC ICC Order elements is based on an FCC regulated rate-of-return on investment and recovery of operating expenses and taxes, in each case solely to the extent related to interstate access. From 1990 through June 2016, the rate-of-return had been authorized up to 11.25%. In March 2016, the FCC reduced the authorized rate-of-return to 9.75% effective July 1, 2021, using a transitional approach to reduce the impact of an immediate reduction. Rate-of-return transition began on July 1, 2016, with the authorized rate reduced to 11.0%, with further 25 basis points reductions each July 1 thereafter until the authorized rate reaches 9.75% on July 1, 2021. The FCC requires terminating interstate access rates to move to a “bill and keep” arrangement by July 1, 2020, which will eliminate access charges between carriers. Initial reductions in interstate access rates began July 1, 2012, with additional reductions on July 1 of each year through July 1, 2020. The CAF provides recovery of terminating interstate access revenues. This recovery is limited to 95% of the previous year’s revenue requirement and excludes CLECs. 
  Federal Universal Service Fund High Cost Loop Revenue.   One of our eleven operating subsidiaries recovers a portion of its operating costs through the USF HCL, which is regulated by the FCC and administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company, which we refer to as USAC, a non-profit organization. Based on historic and other information, a nationwide average cost per loop is determined by USAC. Any incumbent local exchange carrier whose individual cost per loop exceeds the nationwide average by more than 15% qualifies for USF HCL support. All of our RLECs have been designated as eligible telecommunication carriers, which we refer to as ETCs. The USF HCL, which is funded by assessments on all United States telecommunication carriers as a percentage of their revenue from end-users of interstate and international service, distributes funds to our participating RLEC based upon its costs for providing local services. USF HCL payments are received monthly. 
  Interstate Common Line Support.   An FCC order on October 23, 2016, revised ICLS with new provisions to provide support for broadband capable loops, as well as traditional voice loops, known as Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support, which we refer to as CAF BLS, for rate-of-return carriers. CAF BLS replaces ICLS. CAF BLS requirements include specific broadband deployment

 obligations, including the number of locations to be capable of broadband speeds of 10/1 within certain eligible Census Blocks in our service areas. On January 1, 2017, one of our RLECs began receiving CAF BLS. 
  Alternative Connect America Model.   Through December 31, 2016, our RLECs received USF HCL and ICLS revenue, which is included in our network access revenue. On March 23, 2016, the FCC released an order, which adopted changes to the Universal Service programs, directed to preserve and advance voice and broadband service in areas served by rate-of-return carriers. The order provided qualifying rate-of-return carriers the option of receiving model-based support through A-CAM in lieu of legacy rate-of-return support through CAF BLS, formerly ICLS, and USF HCL. A-CAM includes support for broadband service as well as voice service. Ten of our RLECs qualify for A-CAM, and have elected to accept A-CAM support. These elections were effective on January 1, 2017, and will provide A-CAM support through 2026. The A-CAM election includes specific broadband deployment obligations, including the number of locations to be capable of specific broadband speeds within certain eligible Census Blocks in our service areas. 
  Transition Service Fund Revenue.   Our four Alabama RLECs recover a portion of their costs through the Transition Service Fund, which we refer to as the TSF, which is administered by the APSC. All interexchange carriers originating calls in Alabama contribute to the TSF on a monthly basis, with the amount of each carrier’s contribution calculated based upon its relative originating minutes of use compared to the aggregate originating minutes of use for all telecommunication carriers participating in the TSF. The TSF reduces the vulnerability of our Alabama RLECs to a loss of access and interconnection revenue. TSF payments are received monthly. Negotiations to eliminate TSF payments in Alabama were completed in August 2015. TSF payments will be phased out over a five-year period that began in June 2016 and will end in June 2021. The reduction in TSF was 5% in each of 2016 and 2017 and 10% in 2018 and will be 15% in each of 2019 and 2020. 
  Maine Universal Service Fund.   One of our three Maine RLECs recovers a portion of its costs through the Maine Universal Service Fund, which we refer to as the MUSF, which is administered by the MPUC. All local and interexchange carriers in Maine contribute to the MUSF on a monthly basis, with the amount of each carrier’s contribution calculated based upon a percentage of retail intrastate revenues. The MUSF was created to support RLEC universal service goals in response to legislative mandates to reduce intrastate access rates, expand local calling areas and cap local service rates. 
Internet 
 We provide a variety of internet data services to our customers, including bulk broadband data to support large corporate enterprise users and digital high-speed data lines in varying capacity speeds for business and residential use. Digital high-speed data services are provided via fiber to the premise; digital subscriber line, which we refer to as DSL; cable modems; and wireless broadband, depending upon the location in which the service is offered, and via dedicated fiber connectivity to larger business customers. We charge our internet customers a flat rate for unlimited usage and a premium for higher speed internet services. We are able to provide digital internet data lines to over 95% of our RLEC customers and all of our CLEC customers. Under A-CAM, we have specific requirements to expand the availability of higher broadband speeds to our customers and expect to invest in our network to meet or exceed those requirements. 
Transport Services 
 Our CLEC receives monthly recurring revenues for the rental of fiber to transport data and other telecommunication services in Maine and New Hampshire from businesses and telecommunication carriers over our fiber network. 
Video and Security 
 We provide cable television services, including high definition, digital video recording capability and video on demand, which we refer to as VOD, over networks with 750 MHz of transmission capacity or by Internet Protocol television, which we refer to as IPTV, in our Alabama service area. We offer digital

 signals, high-definition program content and digital video recording capability through both our traditional cable plant and IPTV and VOD to our traditional cable customers. Our cable television packages offer up to 200 channels. We are a licensed installer of security equipment in Alabama. We offer wireless security systems in Alabama and Missouri and monthly monitoring of security systems through a third-party monitoring company. 
Managed Services 
 We provide private/hybrid cloud hosting services, as well as consulting and professional IT engineering services, for mission-critical software applications used by small and mid-sized North American companies. Revenues are generated from monthly recurring hosting fees, commonly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service, which we refer to as IaaS, monthly maintenance fees, à la carte professional engineering services, and pay-as-you-use Software as a Service, which we refer to as SaaS. Services are domiciled in two diverse Company-owned data centers. 
 Network Assets 
 Our telephone networks include carrier-grade advanced switching capabilities provided by traditional digital as well as software based switches; fiber rings and routers; and network software supporting specialized business applications, all of which meet industry standards for service integrity, redundancy, reliability and flexibility. Our networks enable us to provide traditional and Internet Protocol, which we refer to as IP, wireline telephone services and other calling features; long distance services; digital internet services through DSL, cable modems and dedicated circuits; and specialized customer specific applications. 
Sales, Marketing and Customer Service 
 In Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia, our RLECs and CLEC have historically provided services under the brand names “OTT Communications” and “Reliable Networks.” However, beginning in 2018, all services were rebranded under the brand name “Otelco.” Our CLEC competes with the incumbent carriers throughout each state, as well as with other competitive communications providers, utilizing both an employee and agent sales force. Service configurations are tailored to meet specific customer requirements, utilizing customer designed voice and data telecommunications configurations. Increased service monitoring for business customers is provided through a state of the art network operations center and serves as a differentiator for our offers. We offer an IP-based Hosted Private Branch Exchange service, which we refer to as HPBX, that provides industry-leading capability for our customers, as well as cloud hosting and professional engineering services. 
 Our RLEC marketing approach emphasizes locally managed, customer-oriented sales, marketing and service. We believe that we are able to differentiate ourselves from any competition by providing a superior level of service in our territories. Each of our RLECs has a long history in the communities it serves, which has helped to enhance our reputation among local residents by fostering familiarity with our products and level of service. Our customer service representatives are local residents and often have a direct connection to their communities, which we believe further improves customer satisfaction. We also build upon our strong reputation by participating in local activities, such as local fund raising and charitable events for schools and community organizations and, in Alabama, by airing local interest programs on our local access community cable channels. 
 Part of our strategy is to increase customer loyalty and strengthen our brand name by deploying new technologies and by offering comprehensive bundling of services, including digital high-speed internet access, cable television, unlimited long distance and a full array of calling features. In addition, our ability to provide our customers with a single, unified bill for all of our RLEC and traditional CLEC services is a competitive advantage and helps to enhance customer loyalty.

 Competition 
 Local Services 
 We believe that many of the competitive threats to wireline telephone companies are not as significant in portions of our RLEC service areas as in more urban areas. The demographic characteristics of rural telecommunications markets generally require significant capital investment to offer competitive wireline telephone services with low potential revenues. However, our RLECs face wireline telephone competition in the majority of our markets from a cable company or electric co-operative offering telephone and data services. New market entrants, such as providers of satellite broadband, and indirect competition, such as providers of voice over IP, which we refer to as VoIP, have also gained greater acceptance over time. 
 We currently qualify for the federal rural exemption from certain interconnection obligations that support industry competition, including obligations to provide services for resale at discounted wholesale prices and to offer unbundled network elements. If the exemption were terminated by a state commission, our RLECs could face additional competition. 
 In all of our markets, we face competition from wireless carriers. We have experienced a decrease in voice lines as a result of customers switching their residential wireline telephone service to a wireless service. A portion of the wireless technology threat to our business is reduced, due in part to the topography of some of our telephone territories, which can result in inconsistent wireless coverage in some areas. Nevertheless, as wireless carriers continue the deployment of newer technologies in our territories, we expect to experience increased competition from these carriers. 
 The long distance market remains competitive in all of our RLEC territories. We compete with major national and regional interexchange carriers as well as wireless carriers and other service providers. However, we believe that our service bundling that includes long distance, our long-standing local presence in our territories and our ability to provide a single, unified bill for all of our services, are major competitive advantages. The majority of our customers have selected us for their long distance services as part of their overall package of services. 
 In Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, we operate as a facilities-based CLEC in areas primarily served by Consolidated Communications (formerly FairPoint Communications) or Verizon. There are other competitors who serve these markets today as both facilities-based and resale carriers. Our focus has been on the small-to-medium size business customer with multiple locations and enterprise telecommunications requirements, where we offer a combination of knowledge, experience, competitive pricing and new IP-based products to meet their specialized needs. 
 Internet 
 Competition in the provision of RLEC data lines and internet services currently comes from alternative digital high-speed internet service providers. Competitors vary on a market-to-market basis and include cable providers Charter Communications, Inc., under the Spectrum brand name, which we refer to as Spectrum, Comcast Corporation, which we refer to as Comcast, and Co-Mo Electric Cooperative, Inc. In Missouri, we provide high-speed data lines to approximately 1,900 subscribers outside of our rural telephone services territory. Our CLEC customers are provided a variety of data service options based on their individual requirements. 
Transport Services 
 Other local telephone companies, long distance carriers, cable providers, utilities, governments, and industry associations deploy and sell fiber capacity to users. Existing and newly deployed capacity could affect market pricing. Multi-year contracts generally protect existing relationships and provide revenue stability. The cost of and time required for deploying new fiber can be a deterrent to adding capacity. We have expanded our fiber network in Maine to reach additional locations and serve incremental customers.

 Video and Security 
 We offer cable television services, including VOD, in our Alabama territory. Cable services are delivered through traditional cable technology and IPTV. Spectrum provides cable service, passing about 30% of our RLEC Alabama telephone subscribers and approximately 60% of our RLEC Maine telephone subscribers. In Massachusetts, Comcast provides cable service, passing more than 90% of our telephone subscribers. In West Virginia, Shentel provides cable service, passing more than 98% of our telephone subscribers. In addition, we compete against digital broadcast satellite providers including DISH Network and AT&T’s DirecTV in our Alabama territory. Our broadband subscribers also have access to “Over The Top” entertainment services offered by numerous providers, such as Netflix and Hulu, including local broadcast channels in Vermont. 
Managed Services 
 The managed services and cloud hosting market has numerous competitors from very large multi-dimensional companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM, to divisions of large telecommunications firms, to small operations serving specific local markets or industries. Our managed services offerings are focused on small and mid-sized companies who have mission-critical software applications that also need operational and design support for their applications. 
Information Technology and Support Systems 
 We have an integrated software system that functions as both an operational support and a customer care/billing system. The system includes automated provisioning and service activation, mechanized line records and trouble reporting. These services are provided through the use of licensed third-party software, which has been tailored for our use by the vendor. 
 We have implemented all currently established safeguards to Customer Proprietary Network Information as established by the FCC for telecommunications providers, and we are compliant with the “red flag” provisions of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. 
 Environment 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws. The environmental compliance costs incurred by us to date have not been material, and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs will become material in the foreseeable future. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 203 employees, 2 of which were part time employees. None of our employees are members of, or are represented by, any labor union or other collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
