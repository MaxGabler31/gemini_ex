ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
Assure is a best-in-class provider of outsourced Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring (“IONM”) and an emerging provider of remote neurology services. The Company delivers a turnkey suite of clinical and operational services to support surgeons and medical facilities during invasive procedures. IONM has been well established as a standard of care and risk mitigation tool for various surgical verticals such as neurosurgery, spine, cardiovascular, orthopedic, ear, nose, and throat (“ENT”), and other surgical procures that place the nervous system at risk. Accredited by The Joint Commission, Assure’s mission is to provide exceptional surgical care and help make invasive surgeries safer. Our strategy focuses on utilizing best of class personnel and partners to deliver outcomes that are beneficial to all stakeholders including patients, surgeons, hospitals, insurers, and shareholders.
​
During each procedure, Assure provides two types of services, the Technical Component and Professional Component of IONM. Our in-house Interoperative Neurophysiologists (“INP”) provide Technical Component IONM services from the operating room throughout the procedure, while the telehealth-oriented supervising practitioners provide a level of redundancy and risk mitigation in support of the onsite INPs and surgical team. In addition, Assure offers a comprehensive suite of IONM services, including scheduling the INP and supervising practitioner, real time monitoring, patient advocacy and subsequent billing and collecting for services provided.
​
​
Historically, the foundation of Assure’s business has been providing the Technical Component of IONM via our INP staff. We employ highly trained INPs, which provide a direct point of contact in the operating room during the surgeries to relay critical information to the surgical team. In our one-to-one model, Assure pairs a surgeon with a team of INPs to promote a level of familiarity, comfort and efficiency between the surgeon and the INP. Each INP has the ability to handle approximately 200 cases annually. Our INPs monitor the surgical procedure using state of the art, commercially available, diagnostic medical equipment. Assure INP’s are certified by a third-party accreditation agency. The success of our service depends upon the timely and successful interpretation of the data signals by our INPs and thereafter to quickly determine if there is a deficiency and the surgical intervention required to positively impact the patient and surgery. Employing this model, Assure has rapidly expanded its operational footprint from a home base in Colorado and increased its number of managed cases from approximately 1,600 in 2017 to approximately 17,400 in 2021.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, Assure began executing on its long-term vertical integration plan by expanding into remote neurology services. As a result, Assure began delivering remote neurology services in support of the surgical team and INPs rather than exclusively relying on third- party supervising practitioners as it had previously. Assure is transitioning the Professional Component of its IONM service offering. We currently have supervising practitioners employed and working with surgical teams and our INPs from remote locations. They are utilizing equipment and training to monitor electroencephalographic (“EEG”) and electromyography (“EMG”) and a number of complex modalities during surgical procedures to pre-emptively notify the underlying surgeon of any nerve related issues that are identified. 
​
Remote neurology services is a one-to-many model, and as a result, has a different financial profile than the Technical Component. Supervising practitioners provide remote neurology services from an off-site location and maintain the ability to manage multiple cases simultaneously. As a result, each supervising practitioner has the ability to handle 2,500 or more cases annually. In 2021, Assure performed approximately 17,400 total managed cases including managing approximately 2,100 remote neurology cases. The number of remote neurology managed cases is expected to expand significantly as our supervising practitioners’ ramp-up and more are added to the team. 
​
Bringing the Professional Component of IONM in-house generates a number of positives for Assure. First, we will be able to oversee quality of service for providing remote neurology services. This commitment to quality supports our efforts to sign new in-network agreements with insurance payors and facility-wide agreements with hospitals. Second, by bringing the remote neurology function in-house, we are able to significantly reduce cost of delivery, allowing the Company to improve our profitability on every case we perform. Our objective is to significantly cut the cost of delivery for remote neurology services going forward. Additional scale will serve as a catalyst for margin expansion in the future. Third, for most of the cases we perform, remote neurology services represent the creation of a new revenue stream. Fourth, providing remote neurology services for IONM creates opportunities in adjacent markets where similar remote neurology services are utilized. The shift to providing remote neurology ourselves was straightforward. We had already built the platform and maintained the patient volume. Insourcing this process is simply a matter of replacing contractors with Assure supervising practitioners to service this volume. The result will be higher margins, a new revenue stream and turning cash over more quickly.
​
Collectively, support from Assure’s high quality Technical and Professional IONM services results in decreased hospital and surgeon liability, abbreviated patient stays, fewer readmissions, reduced hospital costs, enhanced overall patient satisfaction and the efficient achievement of better clinical outcomes.

Over the past two years Assure has built a platform to support our future growth and development. The attributes of our platform detailed in the graphic above include: maintaining exceptional clinical operations, automating our revenue cycle management function and collecting cash faster, boosting managed care through the signing of in-network agreements with insurance payors, minimizing operational bottlenecks, particularly around onboarding and credentialing, instituting an ongoing training and development program for clinical staff to ensure we maintain industry-leading skills and performance, and successful execution on an M&A strategy in a highly fragmented market that has led to three accretive transactions over the past two years. This platform was built with the intent of having these key functional areas support IONM in our key surgical verticals including: spine, neurosurgery, vascular, ENT and orthopedic. As we transition to becoming a provider of remote neurology services, we believe our expertise in IONM will assist us in entering adjacent markets in which Assure supervising practitioners can also provide patient services. We expect to begin providing services in new verticals including EEG, epilepsy, sleep study and stroke by leveraging key competencies we have built over the past two years.
​
In 2021, Assure provided IONM services for approximately 258 surgeons in 150 hospitals and surgery centers (which we refer to as “Procedure Facilities”) located in: Colorado, Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, South Carolina, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada and Utah. Our continued organic geographic expansion initiatives, including facility-wide outsourcing agreements with medical facilities and hospital networks, potential for selective acquisitions, and the extension of our platform into remote neurology services, is expected to generate substantial growth opportunities going forward.
Clinical leadership, surgeon support and patient care are Assure’s cornerstones. We make substantial ongoing investments in our training and development of clinical staff and have created a fellowship program to rigorously train new INPs to cost-effectively join the Assure team. In addition, we have partnered with the internationally renowned Texas Back Institute on clinical research relating to IONM safety and efficacy. Isador Lieberman, M.D., the president and director of the scoliosis and spine tumor program at the Texas Back Institute, is a member of Assure’s Medical Advisory Committee. 
2021 in review
Assure’s key operational and financial metrics improved substantially in 2021 compared with 2020 despite the lingering impact of COVID-19. This includes a record number of managed cases performed of approximately 17,400 and record revenue of $29.2 million. In addition, net loss of $2.8 million and EBITDA of $(834 thousand) represented significant year-over-year improvements. Our EBITDA improvement stands out as it occurred during a year in which we were focused on M&A integration, building out our infrastructure and platform, and substantial professional fees associated with our listing on NASDAQ Capital Markets, M&A transactions and the negotiation of a new credit facility. Going forward, we will continue to focus on minimizing cash burn and generating positive EBITDA while driving rapid growth.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to build a telehealth remote neurology services company with exceptional capabilities in IONM and numerous adjacent markets.
We have a history of providing industry-leading IONM services with an emphasis on clinical excellence and patient well-being, and we are in the midst of a significant transformation to position ourselves for growth. With our focus on execution and providing a high level of patient care, we are transforming from being a provider of the Technical Component of IONM utilizing a one-to-one model of INPs in the operating room to a business that also provides the Professional Component of IONM via off-site remote neurology services in a far more scalable one-to-many model. The next step in our development will be expanding into adjacent remote neurology markets while utilizing the same platform and employees. This will extend our reach and redefine our position in the industry. We are thoughtfully deploying capital and focusing our investment in high potential growth initiatives including: organically expanding into new states, growing our remote neurology platform, signing new IONM outsourcing agreements with hospitals and medical facilities, as well as opportunistic M&A. In addition, we are investing to make our revenue cycle management function more automated, improving the velocity of our cash collections. The data and analytics-driven Company we are building will play a bigger role in the success of our key stakeholder groups: surgeons, hospitals, insurance companies and patients, and in turn deliver attractive returns to our stockholders.

Our Priorities
Assure made significant progress against our corporate objectives in 2021:

As we look ahead to 2022, we are pursuing the following objectives:
​
Continuing to expand, scale and grow our managed case volume. We expect to perform more than 25,000 managed cases in 2022, all from organic sources, representing an anticipated increase of more than 40% from 2021. An anticipated driver for growth in 2022 is a 3-year agreement the Company was awarded in November 2021 to become the sole contracted provider of IONM services for Premier, Inc., the second largest group purchasing organization in the U.S. The Premier network unites an alliance of more than 4,400 hospitals and approximately 225,000 other providers.
​
Opportunistic Acquisitions. We expect to continue to be a consolidator in the highly fragmented IONM industry. The three acquisition transactions completed by Assure over the past two years have been highly accretive.
​
Expand our remote neurology capabilities. We will focus on providing higher quality service at a lower cost. We believe this will support margin expansion as we scale, benefit revenue growth and assist us in penetrating adjacent markets.
​
Set a greater proportion of our commercial insurance volume in contractual rates by signing in-network agreements with insurance payors. This helps Assure reduce risk, minimize complexity, accelerate the timing of payments and protect our liquidity. Overall, across all markets, we have approximately 30% of our total commercial volume in contractual rates with payors, either directly or indirectly. By the end of 2022, our goals is to drive over 50% of our commercial insurance volume in-network. Very few of our intraoperative neuromonitoring peers have the scale in terms of managed case volume nor the organizational expertise to strike similar deals. We will also be aggressive in utilizing the dispute resolution process authorized by federal legislation in the No Surprises Act. This law went into effect in January 2022. For the first time, it provides companies like Assure with the ability to arbitrate claims in every U.S. state and to batch similar claims where we have performed service but were not paid. 
​
Accelerate digital transformation and automation to add predictability and transparency to cash flows. Cash collection has been a focus over the last two years as we brought our revenue cycle management function inside the organization. We have improved significantly, but there is substantial room for further automation, as well as incorporating artificial intelligence and analytics to improve collections and cash flow. 
​

7



Extend clinical leadership. We have invested heavily in research and continuing education. This includes setting up our own fellowship program to cost effectively train new INPs. Being seen as an industry leader helps Assure win new business and bring more surgeons onto our platform.
​
Our Responsibilities
Assure offers a turnkey full suite of IONM services including scheduling of the INP and supervising practitioner, real time monitoring and subsequent billing for services provided. 
Prior to a patient’s procedure, Assure will coordinate with the surgeon’s office to obtain the necessary information and documentation to provide IONM services, such as the patients’ insurance information, patients’ demographic information and office/clinic notes. We provide educational materials to the surgeons office for inclusion in each surgical patient’s pre-operative packets to educate and provide comfort to the patient about IONM services. Prior to the surgery, an Assure patient advocate connects with the patient to explain our role during the surgery, the benefits of IONM and billing issues that may affect the patient. Assure’s INP will arrive at the hospital with an IONM unit and disposable supplies and electrodes. The INP meets with the patient to explain their role during the surgery, discuss the patients’ pertinent past medical history, explain the risks and benefits associated with IONM and have the patient sign consenting forms for IONM to be utilized on their procedure.
All IONM procedures include both technical services (performed by INPs) and professional services (performed by supervising practitioners). During the surgery, the INP will continuously monitor the functional integrity of the peripheral or central nervous system by recording, troubleshooting, documenting and communicating activity arising from the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, somatosensory or motor nerve systems using the IONM unit provided by Assure and communicating results in real-time to the surgeon. The INP and surgeon are supported by an off-site supervising practitioner providing remote neurology oversight services. The supervising practitioner also monitors the functional integrity of the peripheral or central nervous system throughout the procedure communicating in real-time with the surgeon and INP throughout the process. In some cases (and increasingly), remote neurology services are performed directly by Assure’s supervising practitioners. In other instances, these services are provided by and through subsidiaries, which owns interest in entities that either directly perform the Professional Component through third party contracted neurologists or oversight reading physicians.
Assure Interoperative Neurophysiologists

Assure currently employs specialized IONM INPs that are board certified CNIM or board eligible CNIM by ABRET. ABRET seeks to encourage, establish and maintain standards of clinical EEG, Evoked Potential Technology, and Neurophysiologic Intraoperative and long-term monitoring, by offering credentialing exams to evaluate the skills and knowledge of technologists, and by supporting lab accreditation. 
Assure has developed an Intraoperative Neurophysiologist Fellowship program. This Fellowship program trains new INPs from start to board certification, allowing for consistently high caliber well trained professional INPs for placement into emerging and growing markets. Training and developing our own talent pool allow for more flexible scalability.
Assure Supervising Practitioners
Assure currently employ supervising practitioners performing remote neurology services. These physicians are highly trained and are specialized in providing off-site tele neurology services. Multiple Assure supervising practitioners have already received the training necessary to provide remote neurology services in targeted expansion markets including EEG. 
Commercial Insurance 
Following the procedure, assuming the patient has health care insurance under a commercial health care policy, we will invoice the insurance company directly for IONM services. The invoice provided to the insurance company will detail each modality monitored by the INP for the neural protection of the patient during the procedure. After we have submitted 

8



the claim to the private insurance company, our patient advocate will contact the patient to further explain the details on the explanation of benefits insurance form and to ensure the patient was satisfied with the level of service provided by us. 
Facility Billing 
In the event a patient is uninsured or has insurance coverage under a government health care policy (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare or Veterans Administration) the facility where the procedure took place will be billed for the IONM services for the patient, as agreed to in each facility service contract.
Hospital Agreements
Assure Neuromonitoring must enter into a contracted services agreement with each procedure facility it provides IONM services prior to initiating IONM services. The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that Assure provides its services in accordance with all regulatory and accreditation standards, including those requirements imposed by The Joint Commission, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and all applicable federal, state and local laws. 
Pursuant to these agreements, Assure Neuromonitoring has agreed to provide IONM services and shall ensure the real-time interpretation of such monitoring to patients. 
Each INP is required to be approved and decreed privileges to practice IONM by each of the contracted facilities. All INP who are performing onsite monitoring must be certified or board eligible from one of the following organizations (i) American Board of Neurophysiologic Monitoring; (ii) American Board of Electrodiagnostic Technologists; or (iii) ABRET.
Payment for services, revenue mix and seasonality
Over half of Assure’s patients commonly have commercial health insurance coverage (“Commercial Payor”) and we are compensated via their health insurance plan. Assure’s commercial insurance patients represent the significant majority of our revenue and profit margin. We produce separate bills for the Technical Component and the Professional Component of the IONM services we perform. The remainder of our patients, who do not have commercial insurance coverage, compensate us via hospital agreements. Regardless of type of payment and whether the patient has commercial insurance coverage, Assure provides the same high level of service and quality of care. 
The majority of our commercial payors are billed out-of-network and we negotiate payment for each claim. The remainder of commercial payors utilize a contracted rate. The majority of contracted rates are via indirect agreements with third-party organizations or related entities of the commercial payor with a smaller portion in direct agreements with contracted rates. 
We bill, collect and keep 100% of the revenue associated with the Technical Component of the services we provide. For the Professional Component, when the supervising practitioner is an Assure employee or where we own 100% of the entity managing the procedure the Company bills, collects and keeps 100% of the revenue. In instances in which the Professional Component are provided via Managed Service Agreements (“MSAs”) with surgeons or through agreements with Professional Entities (“PEs”), we engage in a revenue share based on our percentage ownership of the PE.
In addition, the surgical segment of the health care industry tends to be impacted by seasonality due to the nature of most benefit plans resetting on a calendar year basis. As patients utilize and reduce their remaining deductible throughout the year, we typically see an increase in volume throughout the year with the biggest impact coming in the fourth quarter. Historically, our annual revenues are overweighted in the fourth quarter.
Seasonality impacts our revenue mix for similar reasons. As patients with commercial insurance utilize and reduce their remaining deductible throughout the year, we typically see an increase in volume with the biggest impact coming in the fourth quarter. Historically, our revenue mix is relatively overweighted to patients with commercial insurance in the second half of the year and to patients with government insurance in the first half of the year.

Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic
Our business and results of operations have been, and continues to be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic and related events and we expect its impact to continue. Although a significant portion of our anticipated revenue for 2022 is derived from fixed-fee and minimum-guarantee arrangements, primarily from large, well-capitalized customers which we believe somewhat mitigates the risks to our business, our per-unit and variable-fee based revenue will continue to be susceptible to the volatility, supply chain disruptions, microchip shortages and potential market downturns induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations.
IONM Market in the United States

Overview
A key factor driving the growth of the market is the increasing number of surgeries for which IONM is required. Advances in technology, the growth of the geriatric population in the US and a rising incidence of chronic diseases are other factors increasing the number of spinal, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular surgeries, which in turn is expected to drive market growth in IONM. Renowned medical institutions such as the Mayo Clinic are advocating greater adoption of IONM including requiring medical professionals to complete comprehensive neurophysiology training courses and hosting international IONM conferences.
Market Landscape
The IONM market is bifurcated into in-house and outsourced providers. The end user segment is categorized into hospital and ambulatory surgical centers. IONM finds its application in spinal surgery, neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery, ENT surgery, orthopedic surgery, and other surgeries related to the central or peripheral nervous system. IONM modalities include motor evoked potential, somatosensory evoked potential, electroencephalography, electromyography, brainstem auditory evoked potential, and visual evoked potential.
There has been a substantial increase in the use of IONM services by hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers during complex surgeries. Moreover, the market is moving toward outsourced monitoring to provide advanced treatment options for patients suffering from chronic diseases.
With no dominant players in the industry, the intraoperative neuromonitoring market in the US is highly fragmented. Providers can generally be categorized into three groups: 1) IONM-specific companies, including a limited number of relatively larger players such as Assure, Medsurant Holdings LLC, and MPOWER Health, and a much larger group of small local and regional providers, 2) In-house providers such as hospitals, and 3) Bundled product companies offering neuromonitoring as part of a broader suite of services including Specialty Care, Inc. and NuVasive, Inc. These bundled product companies are believed to be the largest IONM providers in the US, although each is estimated to individually comprise less than 10% of the overall US IONM market.

Market Segmentation by Application
Current market breakdown as relating to the current IONM utilization by procedure classification is approximately:

● | 70% Spinal Surgery
--+-------------------


● | 12% Neurosurgery
--+-----------------


● | 10% Vascular Surgery
--+---------------------


● | 8% ENT, Orthopedic and Other
--+-----------------------------

​
Surgical neurophysiology continues to progress, with the improvement of new applications such as brainstem mapping, spinal cord mapping, and proving the utilization of IONM in surgeries where the nervous system is not at primary risk but a secondary risk of the surgery (such as reducing post-operative deficits caused by malposition).

10



IONM utilization is also highly regional, with the eastern portions of the United States having higher utilization of IONM as compared to the central and western portions of the country, especially for orthopedic and vascular surgery verticals. This regional nature is partly to do with the regional medico-legal issues but also the training of the surgeons. If surgeons train with effective IONM they are more likely to continue to use it in their practice in comparison to surgeons who either were not exposed to IONM or who were exposed to ineffective IONM. Assure currently capitalizes on a key relationship in supporting and working with a neurosurgery residency program.
There are large opportunities that Assure is working to capitalize on with respect to growing the use of IONM monitoring in the underutilized verticals. Assure aims to capture this market by investing in research, correlating improved outcomes in procedures that are not traditionally monitored or where IONM is underutilized. There are also many surgical disciplines that have not been explored with respect to if IONM could be function saving to the patient.
Drivers of the IONM Market
The US IONM market is expected to expand, driven by growth in procedures related to an aging population, increase in prevalence of chronic disorders, adoption of IONM in new surgeries, and increased interest in risk mitigation.
High volume of surgeries
Physicians use IONM during many surgeries. IONM is vital in obtaining real-time status of the nervous system. An increase in the volume of neurosurgeries, spinal surgeries, and orthopedic surgeries has fueled the demand for IONM services.
Advances in technology
With the improvement in health care facilities and advances in technology, vendors are developing innovative and efficient IONM devices. Companies such as Cadwell Industries and Natus Medical extensively invest in R&D to develop advanced IONM devices.
Certain service providers offer advanced IONM services for various surgeries including neurosurgeries and ENT, cardiovascular, orthopedic and spinal surgeries. These companies provide IONM devices such as EEG systems for real time monitoring of the nervous system. Advanced IONM devices help physicians to monitor and record complex patterns of neural activities.
Focus on patient safety
Surgeons use IONM as an additional line of safety during surgeries. IONM systems are used to monitor the nervous system and alert the surgeons prior to the threshold for injury. The IONM systems play a vital role during critical surgeries such as spinal surgeries that involve the insertion of instruments near the nerves or the spinal area and may cause damage to the nervous system. IONM also helps surgeons avoid or minimize common complications such as paraparesis, quadriplegia, and paraplegia that occur during surgeries.
Selected reasons for the rising deployment of IONM include:

● | Patient Safety: IONM helps decrease the risk of surgeries by approximately 90%. IONM systems are also widely accepted, as they are devices approved by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medico-legal Obligations: End-users and hospitals use IONM systems to reduce medico- legal lawsuits from people that have undergone surgeries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth in Surgeries: The rising volume of technically demanding surgeries increases the need for advanced IONM tools. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost Savings: Accurate IONM alerts help save operating room time, facilitating high margin surgeries for the hospital, while reducing length of stay and readmission rates for patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IONM Market Challenges
Cost of surgery with IONM
The cost of surgeries with IONM is more than those without IONM. Surgeries with IONM involve the expenses on IONM devices, intraoperative neurophysiologists, supervising practitioners, and disposable materials. The cost of surgeries restricts the adoption of IONM. Though IONM systems play a crucial role in invasive surgeries such as spinal, neurological, orthopedic and cardiovascular surgeries, it has not been proven to be a cost-effective therapy in all procedures.
Payor payments 
Beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021, we faced an increase in third-party insurance claim payment denials for our technologist services that we believe will continue in the foreseeable future. The increase in technical claim denials is primarily attributable to a shift in third-party insurance company policies to bundle the technologist service payment into the surgical procedure payment made to the facility in which our services are rendered. In response to this change Assure has been renegotiating its facility contracts to obtain reimbursement directly from the facility for technologist services paid through this type of bundling technique.
​
Limited interoperative neurophysiologists
Though the number of surgeries that need IONM continues to increase in the US, only a limited number of interoperative neurophysiologists (“INP”) with expertise in IONM are available. Industry studies estimate that approximately 6,000 board certified INPs are currently working in the United States. INPs with high levels of expertise are required to effectively use IONM devices to record data and diagnose patient alerts. There is also the risk of false recordings due to physiological artifacts arising from other sites. Only highly skilled INPs can perform IONM in hospitals, surgical centers, and neurophysiological laboratories and provide the greatest levels of service to the surgeons they support.
Complications of IONM
Though the popularity of IONM is growing rapidly, there still risks and complications associated with IONM, as there is for any medical procedure.

● | Types of injuries induced by electrical current: Burns may occur at the contact of stimulating electrodes with tissue, when the current density is high. The leakage of high-frequency current through alternate pathways can also cause burns. In addition, high current flow can cause macro shock.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Use of needle electrodes: risk of infection at the electrode site.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electrical cortical stimulation: Transcranial electrical cortical stimulation during MEP monitoring can cause tongue lacerations, oral injuries, and even mandibular fractures. These adverse effects occur due to forceful contraction of the biting muscles as a result of the stimulation. This risk is largely mitigated by appropriate use of bite blocks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Competition
The IONM industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from other IONM and remote neurology providers for patients, physicians, INPs and supervising practitioners. Some of our competitors are larger and have longstanding and well-established relationships with physicians and third-party payors in the community. We also compete with other health care providers in our efforts to hire and retain experienced professionals. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting or retaining key personnel or securing clinical resources.
Some of our competitors are hospitals that provide IONM services for surgeries occurring within their hospital facilities. We also have competitors that are significantly larger than us, may have access to greater marketing, financial and other 

12



resources and may be better known in the general community. As a result of these factors, the Company may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.

In the instances where Assure Networks, or the applicable Assure Networks subsidiary, owns an interest in the entity performing the Professional Component, our corporate structure is based on a legal analysis that is completed by a third-party law firm to determine the specific state law requirements with respect to the corporate practice of medicine. Once Assure Networks or the applicable Assure Networks subsidiary obtains a legal determination regarding the recommended corporate structure, the applicable entity is established.
​
Management Services Model:
​
In the instances where Assure Networks or the applicable Assure Networks subsidiary is unable to own an interest in the entity performing the professional component due to state laws or regulations, Assure Networks or the applicable Assure Networks subsidiary enters into a management services agreement whereby Assure Networks or the applicable Assure Networks subsidiary agrees to perform management services on behalf of a third party unrelated entity performing the Professional Component and is paid fair market value compensation for such services. The fair market value compensation is based on a third-party fair market value valuation prepared by a professional valuation firm engaged by Assure Networks or the applicable Assure Networks subsidiary.

Privacy
Assure is committed to protecting the privacy of its patients by safeguarding all medical information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). Assure’s processes are also fully compliant with the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health Act (Hitech). Assure currently relies on its data security by storing all confidential information, including patient information, with a third-party company called ShareFile, which is owned and operated by Citrix Systems, Inc. ShareFile has, among other security measures, a third-party validated application and datacenter control from SOC 2 and SSAE 18 audits, bank-level encryption technology, multiple data storage locations around the globe and disaster recovery centers in the United States and Europe. We rely upon these party Companies and their cloud-based services to ensure all confidential information is safeguarded. Assure’s privacy policy is located on its website at www.assureneuromonitoring.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Government regulation affects our business by controlling our growth, requiring licensure and certification for our facilities and the physicians and other health care personnel who provide services in our facilities and regulating the use of our properties.
Licensure and Accreditation
The health care facilities and our partner professionals are subject to professional and private licensing, certification and accreditation requirements. These include, but are not limited to, requirements imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, state licensing authorities, voluntary accrediting organizations and third-party private payors. Receipt and renewal of such licenses, certifications and accreditations are often based on inspections, surveys, audits, investigations or other reviews, some of which may require affirmative compliance actions by us that could be burdensome and expensive. The applicable standards may change in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all necessary licenses or certifications in good standing or that they will not be required to incur substantial costs in doing so. The failure to maintain all necessary licenses, certifications and accreditations in good standing, or the expenditure of substantial funds to maintain them, could have an adverse effect on our business.
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce the referral of a patient or the purchase, lease or order (or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, lease or order) of health care items or services paid for by federal health care programs, including Medicare or Medicaid. A violation does not require proof that a person had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute, and court decisions under the Anti-Kickback Statute have consistently held that the law is violated where one purpose of a payment is to induce or reward referrals. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute could result in felony conviction, administrative penalties, liability (including penalties) under the False Claims Act and/or exclusion from federal health care programs.
A number of states have enacted anti-kickback laws (including so-called “fee splitting” laws) that sometimes apply not only to state-sponsored health care programs, but also to items or services that are paid for by private insurance and self-pay patients. State anti-kickback laws can vary considerably in their applicability and scope and sometimes have fewer statutory and regulatory exceptions than does the federal law.
Our management carefully considers the importance of anti-kickback laws when structuring company operations and relationships. That said, we cannot ensure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Physician Self-Referral (“Stark”) Laws
The federal Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing “designated health services,” if the physician has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient prescription drug services, clinical laboratory services, certain diagnostic imaging services, and other services that our affiliated physicians may order for their patients. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship, unless an exception applies. The exceptions to the federal Stark Law are numerous and often complex. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation and potential liability (including penalties) under the False Claims Act.
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations concerning physician self-referrals (i.e., referrals by physicians to health care entities with whom the physician has a financial relationship). Such physician self- referrals laws may apply to the referral of patients regardless of payor source and/or type of health care service. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.
Our management carefully considers the importance of physician self-referral laws when structuring company operations and relationships and seeks legal guidance on the parameters of the law. That said, we cannot ensure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the Federal Stark Law or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
False Claims Act
The federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, imposes civil penalties for knowingly submitting or causing the submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment from a government-sponsored program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Under the 2021 annual adjustment, the minimum False Claims Act penalty assessed per violation occurring after December 13, 2021, will be not less than $11,803 and not more than $23,607.  This per violation statutory penalty is in addition to the statutory penalty of three times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the violation.  31 U.S.C. 3729(a)(1). The False Claims Act has “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow individuals to commence a civil action in the name of the government, and the whistleblower is entitled to share in any subsequent recovery (plus attorney’s fees). Many states also have enacted civil statutes that largely mirror the federal False Claims Act, but allow states to impose penalties in a state court.
The False Claims Act has been used by the federal government and private whistleblowers to bring enforcement actions under so-called “fraud and abuse” laws like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. Such actions are not based on a contention that claims for payment were factually false or inaccurate. Instead, such actions are based on the theory that accurate claims are deemed to be false/fraudulent if there has been noncompliance with some other material law or regulation. The existence of the False Claims Act, under which so-called qui tam plaintiffs can allege liability for a wide range of regulatory noncompliance, increases the potential for such actions to be brought and has increased the potential financial exposure for such actions. These actions are costly and time-consuming to defend.
Our management carefully considers the importance of compliance with all applicable laws and when structuring company operations and relationships. Our management is aware of and actively works to minimize risk related to potential qui tam plaintiffs. That said, we cannot assure that the applicable enforcement authorities or qui tam plaintiffs will not allege violations of the False Claims Act or analogous state false claims laws. A finding of liability under the False Claims Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Health Information Privacy and Data Security
The privacy and data security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, contain detailed requirements concerning (1) the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information (“PHI”); (2) computer and data security standards regarding the protection of electronic 

16



PHI including storage, utilization, access to and transmission; and (3) notification to individuals and the federal government in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. HIPAA covered entities and business associates must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules may result in civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil money penalties. HIPAA has four tiers of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, with minimum and maximum penalty amounts within each tier and an annual cap on penalties for multiple violations of an identical provision. The indexed penalty amounts for each violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision are as follows:

● | Tier 1—lack of knowledge: The minimum penalty is $120;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Tier 2—reasonable cause and not willful neglect: The minimum penalty is $1,205;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tier 3—willful neglect, corrected within 30 days: The minimum penalty is $12,045; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tier 4—willful neglect, not corrected within 30 days; The minimum penalty is $60,226.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For all tiers, the maximum penalty is $60,226 and the calendar-year cap is $1,806,757. 45 CFR Part 102, 86 Fed. Reg. 62928 (Nov. 15, 2021).
In the event of a breach, a HIPAA covered entity must promptly notify affected individuals of a breach. All breaches must also be reported to the federal government. Where a breach affects more than 500 individuals, additional reporting obligations apply. In addition to federal enforcement, State attorneys general may bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, obtain damages on behalf of state residents, and enjoin further violations. Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information, which may be similar to or even more stringent than HIPAA. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. We expect increased federal and state privacy and security enforcement efforts.2
Our management carefully considers the importance of compliance will patient privacy and data security regulations when structuring company operations. Our management is aware of and actively works to minimize risk related to patient privacy and data security. That said, we cannot assure that a breach will not occur or that the applicable enforcement authorities will not allege violations of HIPAA’s patient privacy and data security regulations. A breach or an allegation of noncompliance with HIPAA’s patient privacy and data security regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations
We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of waste materials and products. We are compliant with all state and federal licensure and permit requirements. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these materials and products comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance coverage, which we may not be able to maintain on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and attention of our management could be diverted to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us, including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are being implemented, which could adversely affect our operations.
Other Federal and State Health Care Laws
We are also subject to other federal and state health care laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Health Care Fraud Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347, prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or 

17



specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1035, prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. 
Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Penalties range from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation, treble damages, and exclusion from federal health care programs. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law also prohibits a person from transferring any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services.
States have a wide variety of health care laws and regulations that potentially affect our operations and the operations of our partners. Many states have implemented laws and regulations related to so-called “tele-health,” which govern the use of technology to provide health care services, including allowing patients and providers to be in different geographic locations. Tele-health laws may apply to our operations, and the obligations they impose, vary wildly and are in a state of flux. Some states have so-called corporate practice of medicine prohibitions, which govern how physicians are organized to practice medicine (including corporate structure, employment and management). Such prohibitions are used to indirectly regulate ownership of heath care companies and/or management companies and the obligations they impose vary. Some states have “surprise billing” or out-of-network billing laws that impose a variety of obligations on health care providers and health plans. The failure to comply with all state regulatory obligations could be used by health plans to deny payment or to recoup funds, and any noncompliance could subject us to penalties or limitations that could have an adverse effect on our business. The limitations and obligations under “surprise billing” laws vary by state, and many states are actively considering additional legislation and/or regulation in this area creating a state of flux in the law.
Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some of these state laws apply to all health care services and not just those covered under a governmental health care program. From time to time, private health plans attempt to use such laws as a basis to deny claims or recoup payments previously made to health care providers.
A determination of liability under any of the laws above could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable laws.
Other Regulations
In addition to the regulatory initiatives described above, health care facilities, including our partner facilities, are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may affect their operations, facilities, and properties. Violations of these laws could subject us to civil penalties and fines for not investigating and remedying any contamination by hazardous substances, as well as other liability from third parties.
Human Capital - Employees
Our human capital resources consist of employees and relationships that we maintain with third party service providers, including surgeons and hospitals. As of December 31, 2021, we had 134 full-time employees.
​

18



While we do not use any formal human capital measures or objectives, we focus our hiring efforts on offering competitive opportunities, which means recruitment, training and retaining personnel that demonstrate a high level of technical expertise and experience in the medical profession. We value diversity, professionalism, safety and collaboration within our organization.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Diversity
​
We value the benefits that diversity brings and seek to maintain a workforce comprised of talented and dedicated employees with a diverse mix of experience, skills and backgrounds collectively reflecting the strategic needs of the business and the nature of the environment in which we operate. In identifying qualified hires, we will consider prospective candidates based on merit, having regard to those competencies, expertise, skills, background and other qualities identified from time to time by management as being important in fostering a diverse and inclusive culture which solicits multiple perspectives and views.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other exemptions from requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemptions from non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may, and intend to, take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large-accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
