•Automotive. In the automotive market, our antennas are deployed in a wide range of vehicles to support a variety of wireless connectivity solutions in the fleet and aftermarket segment and support a variety of technologies that include Wi-Fi, 3G, LTE, 5G, and satellite connectivity. The fleet and aftermarket segment of the automotive market consists of applications whereby rugged vehicular wireless routers are paired with external antenna systems to provide connectivity to fixed and mobile assets and includes first responder and public safety vehicle fleets, the targets for our AirgainConnect AC-HPUE antenna-modem. Within the fleet and aftermarket market segment, there has been a rise in the number of antennas per vehicle. This is largely driven by the increasing needs of connectivity across different access technologies that include Wi-Fi, 3G, LTE, 5G, and satellite. We estimate the total addressable market for our antennas (excluding antenna-modems) in the automotive fleet antenna market in North America, will grow at a CAGR of 11% from 2021 and 2024, based on ABI Research device shipment numbers and our internal ASP estimates. 
 As a wireless connectivity solution provider that has a history in radio frequency technology, we are leveraging our experience in embedded antenna solutions and embedded modems to transition from a components provider to a wireless system solutions provider. In 2020 we announced our new patented AirgainConnect® platform. We believe this flagship platform offers a novel solution in our public safety and fleet focused automotive markets and will play a key role in our future strategy for 5G solutions internationally for automotive and enterprise markets. The first product from the AirgainConnect platform is the FirstNet Ready AirgainConnect AC-HPUE antenna-modem, targeting vehicles used by first responders like police, fire and EMS and public safety support vehicles which include bus, rail, courier, utility, waste or water management, and security. The AirgainConnect AC-HPUE antenna-modem includes an integrated high-power LTE modem supporting the 3GPP Band 14 HPUE (or high power user equipment) output power functionality known as MegaRange by AT&T. This compact vehicle antenna-modem solution tightly couples essential LTE radio components with the antenna system to provide improved connectivity for public safety and fleet vehicles certified to run on the AT&T FirstNet network. The AirgainConnect AC-HPUE more than doubles the range of existing solutions, a result of its ability to transmit 10 times the power of existing solutions today. The incremental power improves the ability to communicate in challenging environments including dense urban areas, underground garages and tunnels, and provides a significant advantage for first responders in poor signal coverage areas like rural areas or mountain ranges. Through technological innovation, the AirgainConnect AC-HPUE antenna-modem combines the modem and antenna elements designed to deal with complexities of integration and heat dissipation, while maintaining a sleek form factor that is suitable for placement on a vehicle, which is a reason why AirgainConnect AC-HPUE is the first antenna-modem product servicing AT&T FirstNet.
The AirgainConnect AC-HPUE antenna-modem initially targets the U.S. first responder market, which we believe represents a $500 million plus addressable market for products in the AirgainConnect platform. The average selling price of the AC-HPUE is near the $1,000 range, which represents a significant increase over the average selling price for our portfolio of antenna products, which were sold in the tens of cents to tens of dollars range.
We have already begun developing products to address other U.S. carriers, global carriers, and enterprise fleet opportunities leveraging the AirgainConnect platform that will expand the $500 million plus addressable market significantly with a global total addressable market for the AirgainConnect platform we estimate at $4 billion today. We are very excited about this first product, the potential of the AirgainConnect platform overall, and the related growth potential as we further our transition to a wireless systems solutions provider.

Industry Background and Market Opportunity
Global adoption of Wi-Fi has been a major contributor to our growth history to date. An increasing amount of people rely on Wi-Fi as the primary means to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi has become critical and vital to every public venue (retail shopping centers, airports, sports venues, the hospitality space, among others), and has become the key method for in-home consumer connectivity. As we transition to a more comprehensive wireless systems solution provider and continue to drive increased growth in the enterprise and automotive markets, mobile network (cellular) connectivity, and 5G in particular, is becoming an increasingly significant portion of our business, underpinned by the growth in cellular connectivity and data consumption demands globally. While historically Wi-Fi adoption was the primary contributor to our market potential, as we transition into a wireless systems solution provider we will consider mobile network connected device trends as an equal, if not more important indicator of our company’s market opportunity. We believe the greater proportion of traffic being transmitted and received over wireless technologies, and the transition to new and more capable wireless technology standards, are direct indicators of future opportunity for our antenna and wireless connectivity solutions and services.
During the COVID-19 pandemic Wi-Fi connectivity has grown in importance as consumers use it for connecting to videoconferencing, telehealth, and other critical applications and services. Wi-Fi has long been leveraged as one of the main solutions to meet the increasing demand for bandwidth, which enables operators to scale capacity to meet their subscribers’ needs. With advances and ratifications in Wi-Fi standards, dense environments with many concurrently connecting devices and IoT connections such as airports, public transportation, retail, healthcare, smart cities, stadiums, among others, result in public WI-FI use cases across multiple industry segments. Wi-Fi 4 and 5 Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11ac) standards are expected to represent 66.8% of all WLAN endpoints by 2023 providing a range of speeds that allow users to view medium-resolution video streaming because of the higher throughput. Wi-Fi 5, with very high theoretical speeds, is considered a true wired complement or equivalent and can enable higher definition video streaming and services with use cases that require higher data rates. The latest Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard further improves the average throughput per user by a theoretical factor of at least four times in dense user environments, which will allow for dense IoT deployments. By 2023, 27% of all WLAN endpoints are expected to be equipped with Wi-Fi 6.
To help meet the increasing demand for Wi-Fi and other unlicensed services, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has led the way making additional blocks of frequency spectrum such as 5.9GHz and 6-7GHz spectrum available. More spectrum and larger channel bandwidth provide the needed capacity to support even more devices, at even faster speeds. We believe this new available spectrum will represent an opportunity for our solutions in fixed wireless access deployments.

Mobile network devices are evolving from lower-generation network connectivity (3G) to higher-generation network connectivity (3.5G, 4G or LTE and now also 5G), combining device capabilities with faster, higher bandwidth and more intelligent networks will contribute to increased mobile and Wi-Fi traffic. According to the Cisco Annual Internet Report (2018-2023), over 70% of the global population will have mobile connectivity by 2023. The total number of global mobile subscribers will grow from 5.1 billion (66% of population) in 2018 to 5.7 billion (71% of population) by 2023. 5G devices and connections will be over 10% of global mobile devices and connections by 2023. By 2023 global mobile devices will grow from 8.8 billion in 2018 to 13.1 billion by 2023 – 1.4 billion of those will be 5G capable. The fastest growing mobile device category is M2M followed by smartphones. The mobile M2M category is projected to grow at a 30% CAGR from 2018 to 2023. Smartphones will grow at a 7% CAGR within the same period. This transition from 3G and below to 4G and now 5G deployment is a global trend and by 2023, nearly 60% of the mobile devices and connections globally will have 4G+ capability. North America will have the highest share of its devices and connections on 4G+ connectivity – 62% by 2023. By 2023 North America will be the region with highest share of connections on 5G at 17%.

Our collaborative relationships with 802.11 chipset vendors offer opportunities for market access and improved sales of both chipsets and antennas. Early access to chipset vendors’ offerings, including industrial design tradeoffs in enclosure, board layout and design, all offer chipset vendors the advantage of optimized performance in their reference designs. When our antennas are consequently listed in the reference bill of materials for the major chipset vendors’ products, these antennas become the default performance recommendation for all products utilizing that chipset. Ongoing contact with the OEM’s and ODM’s, along with default use of the reference bill of materials components specified by chipset vendors, generates a dependable flow of sales opportunities for us.
Growth Strategy
We are in the process of transitioning from a passive antenna and related services provider to a wireless system solutions provider, targeting higher levels of integration and complexity, and therefore, higher selling prices and margins. Climbing the value curve and expanding our presence in adjacent markets are key ingredients to our growth strategy. In terms of markets, our growth strategy is centered around targeting three key markets, specifically, consumer, enterprise and automotive. We consider our consumer market as foundational revenue, with enterprise and automotive markets representing our primary growth markets. The following graphic provides a summary of our estimated total addressable market within each of these three markets. As highlighted in the graphic below, based on ABI Research and our internal ASP estimates, by the end of 2022, we estimate a total addressable market, or TAM, to be in excess of $15.5 billion.



Within our foundational consumer market most of our revenue comes from gateways and routers that are sold to cable multiple system operators, or MSOs. While the MSO companies have faced “cord-cutting” in favor of over-the-top, or OTT, internet-based programming, the cord-cutting trends have not impacted the market for gateways and routers, as OTT devices still need access to the internet in the home through Wi-Fi via the gateway.
The transition towards Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 standards, and more recently the 6GHz extension to Wi-Fi 6, labelled Wi-Fi 6E is driving a new wave in device upgrades. The shift toward Gigabit Wi-Fi 6 is creating increased demand for our solutions as the number of antennas per device increases substantially. Wi-Fi 6 provides a theoretical ability to deliver speeds in excess of 14Gbps using 4x4 MIMO which is comparable to full duplex DOCSIS 3.1 and 5G bandwidths, resulting in wireless bandwidth delivery achieving parity with wireline speeds. Given the performance improvements over existing systems, service providers around the world are expediting their upgrade cycle towards higher performing consumer devices, driving a device design refresh cycle.
We continue to penetrate an increasing scope of adjacent wireless device applications within the consumer market such as home security, smart appliances, and connected healthcare devices. We are also expanding our footprint in these markets through support of an increasing range of IoT wireless standards, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, Thread, NB-IoT and LoRa WAN. Our engineering team provides custom antenna solutions to support a variety of device constraints, including flexible antenna technology for curved and smaller form factors, and specific absorption rate, or SARs, compliant antennas for body worn applications.
In the automotive market, the trend towards the ubiquitous connected car and the demand for increasingly complex aftermarket/fleet wireless connectivity solutions, are key growth drivers for us. The automotive market represents a significant growth opportunity both near and long term. Connected cars require embedded and external mounted antennas for a complete wireless solution. We have a leading portfolio of automotive antenna connectivity solutions, from embedded solutions for OBD II, IHU and connected car gateways, to custom ‘shark fin’ style antennas for automotive applications, mainly targeting mobile and automotive fleet applications for government, public safety, and enterprise applications. Our strategy is to continue to leverage our Antenna Plus brand in the North American fleet and public safety automotive aftermarket segments to generate near-term revenue. For longer term revenue growth opportunities, we are pursuing the European and other international aftermarket fleets and motorhome antenna markets. In 2020 we launched Centurion Next, the first of the 5G family with Wi-Fi 6 support, as part of the 5G refresh of our Antenna Plus fleet antenna product lines. For international markets, we obtained our first European compliance qualification in 2020 opening the door to the distribution of our 5G capable fleet and M2M antenna products.

Our new patented AirgainConnect antenna-modem platform is expected to be the biggest growth contributor to the automotive market. The first AirgainConnect product, the AC-HPUE, is currently one of only two HPUE products certified for use on the AT&T FirstNet network. AT&T activated the first HPUE on the FirstNet network in January 2021. While FirstNet primary users are first responders, there are extended-primary users from transit agencies; public-utility and tow-truck companies; school districts; a state child-protective-services agency, airports, and television/media news outlets. The AirgainConnect platform has the potential to address a very broad set of sub-market applications. In addition, AC-HPUE supports all AT&T LTE bands, so is usable with or without HPUE. We are developing our next generation AirgainConnect product to feature a global modem. The patented AirgainConnect AC-HPUE is the first HPUE antenna-modem product available for vehicles and we have certain exclusive rights to the use of the HPUE modem module from our partner Assured Wireless Corporation, for rooftop vehicular applications.
Within the enterprise market, we are targeting new 5G device programs primarily sub-6GHz, citizens broadband radio service, or CBRS, and Wi-Fi 6, for integrated smart antenna systems. This allows us to leverage our core competencies in advanced antenna designs in a market that offers significantly higher selling prices in the 10s of dollars to hundreds of dollars range. CBRS is driving new use cases including private LTE, leading to private 5G, and cellular operators for fixed wireless access, or FWA, and for secondary indoor spectrum. New 5G spectrum is creating opportunities for operators to establish or expand FWA offerings, to compete with wired incumbents, driving development of a new wave of 5G-enabled customer-premises equipment devices and small cells. The enterprise market is characterized by various submarket segments, each having different characteristics and therefore different growth strategies. Our strategy in the enterprise Wi-Fi submarket is to focus on customized embedded, and external antenna systems for the top two global OEMs in this market. In 2020 we were on-boarded as a supplier to a global leader in Enterprise Wi-Fi for the award of an active stand-alone high-gain Wi-Fi antenna system that we entered into volume production in Q3 2021. On the cellular side of the enterprise market, we are currently developing core 5G antenna systems designs and associated intellectual property, while being actively engaged in a new wave of 5G small cell and FWA device. We expect this trend in 5G enabled device opportunities to continue to ramp in 2022. Technical challenges relate to the complexity of integration and coverage of a broader range of frequency bands, including C-Band, new millimeter wave, or mmW 5G NR spectrum. Our first phase of active beam steering mmW 5G antenna technology was successfully demonstrated to our customers in a live demonstration at CES in January 2020.
Within the M2M and IoT infrastructure submarket of the enterprise market, serviced by our Antenna Plus products, we see expect to see growth in demand for in-building, out-building, and on-building connectivity solutions for commercial, retail, and office, outdoor kiosk, signage, and fixed asset connectivity and tracking. According to ABI research, by 2023, there will be approximately 12 million new M2M wireless modem shipments per year, up from approximately six million new modem shipments in 2018. We expect the addition of NimbeLink products to our portfolio to immediately help us drive growth in the IIoT segment of the enterprise market.
We provide a comprehensive set of services for single and multi-client OTA performance testing, characterization, and validation for wireless devices utilizing the common wireless standards including WLAN, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, LoRa, LTE, CBRS, and 5G. Our service offering includes early-stage system design, custom engineering support, and superior OTA testing services for service providers and OEMs. Our proprietary OTA testing process has become highly regarded in wireless throughput evaluation, enabling our service offering to create stickiness with customers as they depend on our testing services to evaluate their products. Some of our customers have implemented their own performance testing capability in-house, reducing their need to purchase OTA performance testing services from us, thereby limiting the growth potential of our services revenue in the enterprise market. Despite these challenges, we continue to see demand for these services and we plan to continue to leverage this offering to customers and applications in adjacent markets.
Over the next several years, we believe the adoption of 5G on a global basis will offer incremental growth opportunities for us. According to ABI Research, 25% of network traffic will be 5G by 2023. 5G wireless antenna systems are more complex and highly integrated as they need to support complex active architectures for new configurations such as active beam forming, and new frequency block allocations and auctions in the sub-6GHz and mmWave, frequency bands. We believe this shift in antenna complexity and integration will allow us to leverage our expertise and antenna performance, including integration between antenna and the RF front end, to enhance the value proposition to our customers. Furthermore, highly integrated and complex designs demanded by 5G will

require closer coordination between the ecosystem of component vendors, OEMs and Chipset Vendors, a key strength of ours.
In the United States we have a strong position with service providers, carriers, and MSO’s that supply in-home residential wireless equipment. That said, we believe there are growth opportunities on the international front. This includes Europe, especially in areas of the connected home and aftermarket automotive markets which will offer meaningful opportunities.
Our mission is to connect the world through advanced antenna systems and integrated wireless solutions. The key elements of our strategy are listed below.
•Transition to systems solutions. Our core business historically was primarily embedded antenna solutions, but with the launch of the AirgainConnect platform and our NimbeLink acquisition, we are transitioning to a more system-oriented wireless connectivity systems solutions provider. We believe the transition to a wireless system solution provider will offer more value to customers and drive growth in the consumer, enterprise, and automotive markets. 
 •Innovate into new products and markets. We will leverage our core competencies in product innovation, quality, levels of integration, and OTA performance verification processes to continue to release new wireless connectivity solutions taking advantage of developments in our key markets. Our launch of the AirgainConnect platform represents innovation in the automotive market with a more system-oriented product than our previous offerings. Trends such as the IoT are driving an explosion of demand for wireless connectivity in new applications in and out of the home, including IIoT. IIoT market segments are characterized by high volumes, and a prevalence of cellular and GNSS connectivity. Due to the low antenna count and low investment that is typically allocated to the antenna portion of the IIoT designs, the traditional embedded antenna business model was not a strategic priority for us. However, with the acquisition of NimbeLink and the ability to offer a wider variety of cellular solutions we are focused on utilizing our wireless technologies and antennas to pursue growth in the IIoT market segment. 
 •Expand our customer base within our core markets. We sold our products to over 200 end-customers in 2021. Although the customers that pay for our products are often ODMs and distributors, it is primarily the OEMs, carriers, and retail-focused end-customers that drive the selection of our solutions. 
 •Increase our sales to existing customers. Within our customer base, we offer solutions that are valued for performance and reliability. In many cases we are providing antenna solutions for an isolated subset of our customer’s wireless product portfolios. We are constantly working to expand our solutions footprint with existing customers — effectively to mine our existing customer base more effectively to expand our revenue on a per customer basis. As we continue to expand our solution breadth into adjacent markets, we create further opportunity to ‘sell more’ to our existing customers. 
 •Focus on system performance and products with long lifecycles. Our antenna solutions are typically integrated into customers’ products at the design stage. Once an equipment manufacturer designs our antennas into its product offering, it is difficult to design out the incumbent solution since changing antenna suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and usually re-certification of products. This is especially valuable in the service provider market, where product generations generally ship for two to three years before displacement by next-generation devices. 
 •Acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies. The market for wireless solutions is diverse and fragmented. Opportunities arise for acquisition of technologies, assets and companies that would complement our business. We continue to consider acquisitions that will enable us to improve our market footprint, strategic position and to take advantage of economies of scale through consolidation. 
 Customers
Our customers are global. Our top customers, Synnex Technology International (HK) Ltd., Syntech Asia Ltd. and Get Wireless, LLC accounted for more than 45% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. We generally

work with Engineering, Product Management, Product Line Management, Product Marketing, Design, and similar groups to provide antenna solutions. While the sale of the product may be to an OEM and ODM, or via a distributor, we also consider our customers to include chipset vendors and service providers. We market our design capabilities directly to chipset vendors and service providers to generate demand.
•OEM. We sell our products to OEM customers worldwide. These customers make many products including Wi-Fi access points and repeaters, set-top boxes, video gateways, IoT products, and other wireless equipment found in homes, schools, businesses, and networks. Typically, these customers work with us to help overcome a specific performance issue, or to improve product performance against internal or external benchmarks, or they need a partner that can help them shorten time to market through reduced development time and end-device certifications. OEMs are also often mandated or encouraged by service providers to select us. 
 •ODM. We sell our products to ODM customers worldwide with the vast majority being headquartered in Asia. These customers make many of the same products as the OEM customers, but they make these for sale to an OEM or service provider customer. Generally, ODM customers do not own all of the rights to the design and engineering assets of the products they produce and deliver. Historically, ODMs have been thought to focus primarily on cost; however, our ODM customers also emphasize performance and design flexibility when working on antenna and modem selection and placement.
 •Vertical Markets. As we shift from exclusively selling components to building and selling integrated wireless systems, our customer base has expanded from design engineers within OEMs and ODMs to key decision makers within end-user markets. With our AirgainConnect and Antenna Plus product lines, our key end-user markets include first responders, fleet managers, automotive aftermarket, government, and industrial customers. With our asset trackers, our key end-user markets include airlines, transportation, logistics companies, e-bikes and e-scooters, and more. As our portfolio of integrated products grows, so will our key end-user markets.
 •Chipset Vendors. We sell small quantities of our products directly to chipset vendors for their reference designs. Through our close working relationships with the leading chipset makers for WLAN we have developed a significant level of expertise in the testing and evaluation of chipset reference designs and systems. Chipset vendors and semiconductor manufacturers work with us to promote better integration and improved performance, and to create optimal reference designs. These customers help influence purchasing decisions with OEM and ODMs as their reference designs and associated Bills of Materials (BoMs) and suppliers are usually closely replicated in production designs. This can also improve time-to-market for OEM and ODM customers. 
 •Service Providers. Typically, we do not sell products directly to telecommunications and broadband service providers, but these companies often specify overall product performance, and sometimes use our wireless design, test, and validation services. By working with the service providers, we are often written into the carrier’s specifications, which are sent to the OEM or ODM. Our antenna and modem products are then shipped directly from our contract manufacturers to the device manufacturer. In doing so, we can have an impact on an OEM’s or ODM’s ability to hit certain performance levels. We have worked with service providers, and in some cases, we have sold testing equipment that mirrors the testing equipment and environment we use internally. 
 •Value Added Reseller (VARs) and Distributors. These partners combine our antennas, modems, and wireless products with other devices and services to deliver complete integrated and installed aftermarket solutions to end customers. The VAR and Distributor channels are particularly important as the main outlet for our automotive product lines, including Antenna Plus and our new AirgainConnect platform. 
 •Software Developers. We believe we bring a differentiated value proposition to software developers. We focus on providing reliable, high-performance hardware that compliments the deployment of their software, and we provide a middleware that simplifies the connection and management of devices. This middleware connects easily into any enterprise software, making the whole product solution seamless. Because of our approach, we have found significant success in selling to and with software developers in the IoT, managed connectivity, logistics, supply chain, VSaaS (video software-as-a-service), and emergency response markets.


Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to improve market awareness, build a strong sales pipeline, and cultivate ongoing customer relationships to drive sales growth.
Sales
Our global sales effort consists of direct and indirect sales teams, and indirect channel partners. Our direct sales team consists of inside sales personnel based in the United States, China and Taiwan and our outside field sales teams based in the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Our outside field sales teams consist of business, sales, account, technical marketing and program managers, and field application engineers, or FAEs. Our indirect channel partners consist of distributors, engineering design companies and outside sales representatives.
Our outside sales team is engaged in pre-sales, account management, and creating partnership opportunities with third parties such as service providers and semiconductor manufacturers. They are assigned quotas and have defined sales territories and/or accounts. The sales process includes meeting and qualifying potential programs and customers, and actively managing the planning stage of devices they plan to bring to market. Our FAEs assist these managers by providing technical support to existing customers.
Our indirect channel partners provide lead generation, pre-sales support, product fulfillment and, in certain circumstances, post-sales customer service and support. This channel partner network often co-sells with our inside sales and field sales teams. Our channel provides us with additional sales leverage by sourcing new prospects, providing technical support to existing customers, upselling for additional use cases and daily indexing capacities, and maintaining repeat business with existing customers. These channels provide added coverage to customers and prospects we cannot reach directly.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is focused on building a competitive advantage for Airgain’s brands and products in the marketplace. We target two types of customers. For our embedded products, such as our embedded antennas and Skywire modems, we target design teams within OEMs and ODMs. For our integrated products, such as our asset trackers and AirgainConnect, we target end user markets. We use both direct and indirect promotional methods to engage our audiences. Direct methods include advertising, web properties, marketing collateral, email campaigns, paid and organic social media, search engine marketing, media relations, content marketing, direct mail, tradeshows and events, and general lead generation tactics. Indirect methods include co-marketing efforts together with resellers, distributors, system integrators, hardware and software partners, and carriers. Both are areas where we plan to invest greater efforts in the future.
 The three primary goals of the marketing team are to uncover new opportunities in the marketplace, support any existing opportunities currently in the pipeline, and increase deal size by introducing customers and prospects to the breadth of our product line. We continue to see increased benefit from our marketing technology and marketing automation efforts in accomplishing these goals. In addition, digital channels have proven to be more effective in generating additional interest and leads for both the field sales team as well as the channel, so we will continue to shift our focus accordingly.
Competition
The antenna and wireless solutions market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving standards. Our principal competitors fall into four categories:
•Direct Competitors. Direct competitors include independent antenna companies, 2J Antennas USA Corp., Adant Technologies Inc., Asian Creation Communications Factory, AVX Corporation, Fractus S.A., Baylin Technologies Inc., Honglin Technology Group Ltd., Laird PLC, Mobile Mark, Inc., PCTEL, Inc., Pinyon Technologies Inc., Sunwave Communications Co., Ltd., Taoglas Limited, Wanshih Electronic Co. Ltd., and WHA YU Industrial Co., Ltd., among others. Within the antenna industry, the barriers to entry for newcomers is low, and we expect new competitors to emerge in the future. For NimbeLink, Multitech and Digi international are direct competitors for the Skywire modem while the Asset tracker solution competes against full vertical solutions in each industry. 
 •In-house Antenna Design and Engineering Teams. Several of our existing customers, including OEMs and ODMs which design and build complete wireless devices, also have internal resources to design, engineer, and produce antenna solutions. In such cases, we compete against the captive resource of that ODM. Several ODMs, including Arcadyan Technology Corporation, Foxconn Electronics Inc., Gemtek Technology Co. Ltd., and Wistron Corporation, design, manufacture, and sell antennas, in direct competition with us. 
 •Third-Party Custom Design and Engineering Companies. Some of our existing customers and prospects use outsourced engineering services to provide antenna solutions. In these cases, there may be short-term or long-term contractors who work to design, engineer, test, and manage production of an antenna solution. 
 •Automotive Connectivity Companies. Our AirgainConnect platform has the potential to compete with existing suppliers of vehicular modem platforms including Sierra Wireless, Cradlepoint, Peplink as well as the supplier of our modem module, Assured Wireless, among others. We are not aware of any competing solutions with the same architecture and features as AirgainConnect on the market today. In the future, though, we see the potential to create meaningful partnerships with the existing vehicular 


modem and router providers, to supply antenna-modems, particularly while these companies do not have an HPUE capable wireless solution within their own product stable, or antenna-modem products.
The principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•Price and total cost of ownership as a result of reliability and performance issues; 
 •Brand awareness and reputation; 
 •Antenna and antenna-modem performance, such as reliability, range and throughput; 
 •Ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; 
 •Offerings across breadth of in-home wireless products; 
 •Antenna design and testing capabilities; 
 •Lead-time and flexibility to rapidly customize solutions to individual customer requirements; 
 •Relationships with semiconductor/chipset vendors; 
 •Intellectual property portfolio; and
 •The ability to solve complex RF problems across the entire spectrum of broadband connectivity. 
 We compete primarily based on antenna and RF system performance, our intellectual product portfolio, design and testing capabilities, and reputation. We believe we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors. However, some of our existing and potential competitors may have advantages over us. Many of our competitors are significantly larger in scale than we are and have access to greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. In most instances, competition among these vendors creates some level of pricing pressure and forces us to lower prices below our established list prices. Many direct competitors compete primarily based upon price and do not provide the same level of design collaboration and services as we do. For example, some high-volume Asia-based competitors are prepared to operate at less than 20% gross product margins.
Manufacturing and Operations
We have had limited in-house manufacturing capability, solely with respect to antennas deployed in the fleet and M2M antenna market, where final assembly of these antenna products was performed at our facility located in Scottsdale, Arizona. However, we have recently determined to cease production at our Scottsdale facility in the first quarter of 2022, and at that point all of the manufacturing of our products will be done at contract manufacturers, or CMs, located in the United States, China, Vietnam, Mexico and Myanmar. We have long-term relationships with certain of these CMs, and work together to control raw materials, assembly, test, quality and shipment of our antenna products. We perform quality assurance and testing at our California and Scottsdale facilities and monitor the quality performance of our CMs through quality reports and periodic audits.
 We maintain a close direct relationship with our CMs to help ensure supply and quality meet our requirements. The contract manufacturing services required to manufacture and assemble our products can be satisfied by one or more of our CMs, however it may be time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new CM relationships. If our CMs suffer an interruption in their businesses, or experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or we otherwise need to change or add additional CMs or suppliers, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed, and our business could be adversely affected. Our qualified CMs manufacture antenna products according to our design specification, materials specification, quality standards, and delivery requirements. We have full control and authority over the selection of materials, manufacturing processes, and inspection processes. Since our products manufactured in China are predominantly shipped to ODM’s and CM’s within Asia, we have not experienced significant impact as a result of the tariffs imposed on exports from China to the United States. Furthermore, the recent supply disruptions and chip shortages have had and may continue to have a direct impact on our business.


Research and Development
We invest considerable time and financial resources in research and development to enhance our antenna design and system integration capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing to improve our technology. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 70 employees and dedicated representatives within our research and development organization representing approximately 48% of our workforce. Our engineering team consists of engineers located in research, design, and test centers in California, Arizona, and Florida, as well as the United Kingdom and China. Our engineering team actively participates in research and development activities to expand our capabilities and target applications for the consumer, enterprise and automotive markets. We expect to continually expand our product offerings and technology solutions over time and to continue to invest significantly in ongoing research and development efforts.
In the connected home, we are developing a series of antenna products for the home security market, including designs ranging from Z-Wave applications for door sensors to customized connectivity solutions for smart metering using LTE and LPWAN standards, and antenna modules enabling gigabit speed last meter connectivity for broadband operators. We continue to architect and improve our antenna systems for our enterprise class smart antenna customers, as well as new high performance designs for the outdoor Wi-Fi and small cell markets. We continually review alternative antenna designs for increasingly complex carrier gateway products, which are expanding beyond just delivering Wi-Fi to also include 5G, ZigBee, Z-Wave, DECT, LPWAN, NB-IoT and Bluetooth applications. Finally, we are engaged in the design and evaluation of antenna systems for next generation 802.11ax technology, including reference designs with industry leading chipset vendors.
Seasonality
Our operating results historically have not been subject to significant seasonal variations. However, our operating results are affected by how customers make purchasing decisions around local holidays in China. For example, a national holiday the first week of October in China may cause customers to purchase product in the third quarter ahead of their holiday season to account for higher volume requirements in the fourth quarter. In addition, although it is difficult to make broad generalizations, our sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year compared to other quarters due to the Chinese New Year. The broader economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the traditionally slower first quarter sales this year. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year and these patterns may change as a result of general customer demand or product cycles.
Intellectual Property
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of December 31, 2021, we had 236 issued U.S. patents covering our products as well as our embedded and external antenna technology with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2039, and 13 pending patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Outside of the United States we have 21 issued patents and 7 pending patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2037, which entail counterparts of U.S. patent applications. The patents consist of several broad areas as summarized by the following patent groups:
•Methods of determining which antenna pattern to use; 
 •Antenna pattern selection with multiple stations connected to access point; 
 •Dynamically selected antennas for MIMO systems; 
 •Hardware implementations of switched directional antennas; 
 •Large assortment of antenna designs; 
 •Antenna assemblies and systems for vehicles; and 
 •Compact embedded wireless modems and environmental monitoring assemblies. 
 Taken together, these patents with priority dates as far back as November 2001 form both a barrier to competition and a licensable asset for customers in the MIMO and antenna assembly categories.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of many patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. Third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our customers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 145 employees and dedicated representatives including 102 in the United States, 30 in China, 5 in Taiwan, 1 in South Korea and 7 in the United Kingdom. Among the total 145 employees and dedicated representatives, 18 of them were primarily engaged in manufacturing operations, 70 of them were primarily engaged in research and development, 39 of them were primarily engaged in sales and marketing and 18 of them were primarily engaged in general and administration functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
