Competition



We face competitors in many different segments of our business models. We face intense competition from companies with much larger capital resources than us, and, as a result, we could struggle to attract customers and gain market share. Many of our existing or future competitors have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. We will strive to advance our products and technology in each of these sectors ahead of our competitors to gain market share. We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to compensate employees competitively. We face significant competition in several aspects of our business, and such competition might increase, particularly in the market for regenerative therapies.




4







Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better address changing industry standards on regenerative care. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business or decreased customer purchases, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.



We believe that we have competitive strengths and protection via our depth of services and products that we offer in the regenerative medicine field, including, but without limitation to, cell therapy products, isolation systems, physician training, laboratory build outs, medical tourism, and more.



While there are particular or specific competitors in any one of these areas, no one is currently providing the full service one stop solution for such a complete range of offerings in this industry as we are.



Furthermore, we compete by becoming a resource, creating standards of practice, advancing the Stem Cell field in general, and by connecting associates and partners in many different aspects of the business.



Government Regulations



Although Stem Cell therapy is heavily regulated in the US by the Food and Drug administrator, Global Stem Cells group does not focus its business portfolio in US markets, to this end, we have suspended operations in the US. As such, we are not constrained by FDA regulatory jurisdictions. We now operate exclusively in countries where clear regulatory pathways to manufacturing and practice exist.
Marketing



Global Stem Cell Group uses its vast network of professionals in the regenerative and therapeutic industries to market and grow our business. Training seminars held on location in more than a dozen international locations have helped drive the attraction that is bringing new business to our group. The ISCCA is our professional association and is a global network of medical professionals that leverages these multinational relationships to build best practices and further our mission. Our physician training services educate and generate continued reoccurring demand for our solutions, services, and products.



The more we educate physicians about our products and services, the more physician referrals we have received. It has been a difficult task to introduce new methodologies to physicians with more traditional views, but word of mouth has played a crucial role in the growth of our company and our reputation in the industry. We believe our website will further expand our growth as new physicians have an easy to understand synopses of our how our products and services may assist with and benefit their patients. We believe that as our network of physicians widens we will experience significant growth from repeat business from existing clients and with new business from patient referrals.



Numismatics Operations



Meso Numismatics, Inc., has established a growing numismatics operation Meso Numismatics focuses on the Central American Caribbean region with a concentration of products surrounding Mesoamerica (Mexico to Panama).



Having locations in Costa Rica and Florida for the purposes of conveniently shipping products, the Company has the ability to export its inventory of coins, paper currency, bullion and medals from Costa Rica, to be sold in the U.S. and around the world. Likewise, the Company also imports such products back to Costa Rica, to be sold throughout the local markets.



The Company adheres to strict processes related to acquisition and sale of its products. It begins by selecting the best inventory, be it a rare coin from Latin America, or a banknote with an error from the United States. All inventory is carefully screened by management, then sent to be graded by the proper grading authority. For all coins, medals and bullion, the Company’s inventory is sent to the Numismatic Guaranty Company for authentication and grading. For all banknotes, the Company utilizes the services of Paper Money Guaranty, LLC for authentication and grading, both Florida-based companies. Once graded, the inventory is sent to the Company’s Florida-based location prior to being sent to one of the Company’s many customers around the world.

We maintain an online store with eBay (www.mesocoins.com) and participate in live auctions with major companies such as Heritage Auctions, Stacks Bowers Auctions, Lyn Knight Auctions and Sedwick Coins for the sale of its coins, paper currency, bullion and medals. The Company also launched a new application technology available on the Google Play Store, as well as the Apple App Store. The Application is a banknote scanner which instantly identifies key characteristics of a banknote. This includes the catalog reference number of the note, the value, which entity it was issued by, the country of origin and the printer that printed the note. A picture of each note from our database of more than 61,000 banknotes from a combined 750 countries and regions will also be included with the information. For the numismatic industry in particular, this application eliminates the need for reference books, as well as the hours of time it takes to reference all the information about banknotes. With a simple snap of a picture, information is provided to the end-user almost instantaneously.



Meso expects to continue to acquire rare inventory at market rates, from throughout the Meso Region (including Central America and the Caribbean). The inventory is then sent for authentication and grading, followed by said items being sold throughout Meso’s sales outlets. This includes an eBay store with up to, but not limited to, $50,000 in items for sale at any one time. For some of the Company’s rarer inventory, items are sent to major auction houses around the world for sale.



As of December 31, 2021, the Company is working on an inventory tracking system by serial number. Until such time the inventory costs cannot be properly confirmed, therefore any inventory balances are expensed during each reporting period.



License Agreements



Coins / Medals



The Company’s inventory is comprised of roughly 50% coins / medals and 50% paper money. The Company has a meticulous process for the acquisition and sales process for each coin item. The Company specializes in coins from the Meso region, but also acquires coins and medals from elsewhere around the world.



The process starts by visiting local shops and establishments throughout the Meso region to gather information about the coins that Company’s management is considering for acquisition. Once an item has been selected, it is paid for, then packaged and sent from Meso’s Costa Rica location to the Company’s Florida location. From there, the merchandise is once again examined, then sent to NGC (the Numismatic Guaranty Company) for grading and authentication. After approximately three weeks, the items are sent back to Meso’s Florida location for storage, safekeeping and subsequent distribution to its respective destinations.



Management carefully evaluates the grades assigned to each piece of merchandise and then decides which items will be sold through its eBay store, which items will be sold at live auction and which items will be traded for other items. Some pieces are also sent back to Costa Rica for trading, some are sold on eBay and some go to auction powerhouses around the globe.



Meso also acquires ungraded coins / medals from eBay, as well as at specialty shops throughout the Meso region and during certain U.S. shows. Those items are taken through the same aforementioned process.



Paper Money



As indicated above, paper money makes up approximately 50% of Meso’s inventory. The process of acquiring paper money almost mirrors that of coins / medals.



Meso’s management often visits local banks and central banks throughout the Meso region. Management selects banknotes within bundles, aiming to acquire rare and exceptional notes. This includes RADARS (the same serial number back-and-forth), errors and uncirculated rarities.



The note is then sent from Costa Rica to Florida for grading and authentication. For this service, the Company utilizes the Paper Money Guaranty, which is expected to examine the note in great detail, then offers a grade for its condition. The note is encased, then sent back to Meso’s Florida location for distribution to its final destination. Similarly to coins, management inspects each note, then decides whether it will be sold on eBay, at a specialty auction, or traded for other merchandise in the Meso Region.



Similar to coins, Meso also purchases ungraded notes on eBay or at other stores, has them graded through the same process, then decides where to sell it at the end.

Industry Overview



Numismatics itself is the study or collecting of currency, including but not limited to paper money, coins, medals, tokens and other objects. Numismatics is often associated with stamp collecting, philately, and is equally as popular when it comes to hobbies around the world.



The numismatic industry is a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow year-over-year. Estimates provided by PNG (The Professional Numismatists Guild) placed the U.S. rare coin market at between $3.4 and $4 billion in 2018.



At the forefront of the numismatic industry is NGC (The Numismatics Guaranty Company) and PMG (The Paper Money Guaranty). These two organizations, with locations around the world, are responsible for the majority of authenticating and grading various forms of currency. Since its inception in 1987, NGC has graded more than 42 million coins, with 61% representing the US, 16% representing Asia, $13% representing Europe, and, a combined 8% representing Africa, South America and Australia.



Growth Strategy



According to an article published in a May 2017 edition of The Economist, the global numismatic market has a value between $5 Billion and $8 Billion per year. It has been noted that out of all the global numismatic sales around the world, the United States is responsible for roughly 85% of the market, further depicted in the chart below. We believe we can capture market share in the U.S. market and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of, As indicated by the following chart, the Company has the opportunity for growth within the U.S. and the Latin American region as well. The Company has the opportunity for growth within the Latin American region as well. The Company also expects to perform outreach and educate Latin America and Australia about the value of numismatics. 



Many Latin American countries postal services are difficult to navigate due to political unrest and corruption. We believe we have an advantage by having boots on the ground in Costa Rica, and associates throughout all of Latin America, which affords us the opportunity to procure almost any type of item and safely have it graded and then sold.



Successful importation and exportation of merchandise between Central America and the United States is crucial for the Company. Being able to acquire inventory at reduced costs, then selling the items for healthy profits, once graded, continues to be the key to growth.



The Company anticipates organic growth as well growth through acquisitions, as the right opportunities present themselves. The Company has and will continue to reinvest capital in new inventory, further supporting its long-term goal of becoming a recognized, global numismatic brand. Possible future acquisitions include websites / social media pages, in addition to physical numismatic businesses that could become available. These acquisitions could be solely of a company’s inventory, or their physical location and assets as well.



Competitive Strengths



Technology



To our knowledge, Meso Numismatics has the only banknote scanner on the market. The technology, mostly utilized by numismatists, quickly assesses all the information about a banknote and almost instantly displays the information, along with a replica banknote from the database.



The Meso App, available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, is expected to eventually be transitioned into a platform to buy, sell, and trade banknotes. Monetization is expected come from advertisers displaying banner ads, as well as transactional fees from the sales of items. The Company also has the ability, although it does not do so yet, to charge the user for general use of the App.

Location



Meso Numismatics has office locations in San Jose, Costa Rica and Boca Raton, Florida. Having dual locations, especially in these two areas in particular, is extremely advantageous to the Company.



The Costa Rican location of Meso is pivotal for the Company. Management in this location is able to obtain some items, below-market prices due to relationships made within the industry. While a US collector must pay for an item (usually with a premium) plus shipping and handling, having management on the ground allows the Company to acquire items without the extra costs. Management also has relationships with dealers throughout the region and trades / exchanges merchandise for better items. The majority of the Company’s inventory originates in Costa Rica, then is shipped to Florida for grading and authentication.



The Boca Raton location of Meso is almost as pivotal as the Costa Rican location, as the leading grader and authenticator of merchandise (PMG and NGC) also has locations in Florida. Merchandise is sent from Costa Rica to Boca Raton. Once inventoried, merchandise is sent to PMG or NGC for grading and authenticating. Once complete, the inventory is returned to the Boca Raton location where it is safely housed and distributed to its final location. Having this location allows the Company to ship items globally at significantly lower rates than shipping from Costa Rica.



Strategic Partnerships



Meso has strategically partnered with Softon Digital (“Softon”) of Costa Rica, in addition to the above relationships with PMG and NGC. Softon assisted in the development and creation of the Meso App and it is expected that Softon will continue to help the Company evolve the technological portion of the business, with their team of programmers and engineers.
Competition 



In the coins and other collectibles business, we will compete with a number of comparably sized and smaller firms, as well as a number of larger firms throughout the United States. Our primary competitors are American Numismatic Rarities, a comparably-sized coin auctioneer. Many of our competitors have the ability to attract customers as a result of their reputation and the quality collectibles they obtain through their industry connections. Additionally, other reputable companies that sell rare coins and other collectibles may decide to enter our markets to compete with us. These companies have greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. If these auction companies are successful in entering the specialized market for premium collectibles in which we participate or if dealers and sellers participate less in our auctions, we may attract fewer buyers and our revenue could decrease.
Employees



As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 1 full-time employee.
