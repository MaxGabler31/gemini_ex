Item 1. Business
Historical Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003 under the name of Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation and subsequently changed our name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. on May 18, 2015. We commenced operations in the beauty supply industry as of January 1, 2004. On November 30, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of our wholesale and retail beauty supply business. From January 1, 2009 until July 28, 2017, we had no operations and were a shell company.
 
On March 16, 2017, our Board of Directors adopted resolutions, which were approved by shareholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to change our name to “IIOT-OXYS, Inc.”, to authorize a change of domicile from New Jersey to Nevada, to authorize a 2017 Stock Awards Plan, and to approve the Securities Exchange Agreement (the “OXYS SEA”) between the Company and OXYS Corporation (“OXYS”), a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 4, 2016.
 
Under the terms of the OXYS SEA we acquired 100% of our issued voting shares of OXYS in exchange for 34,687,244 shares of our Common Stock. We also cancelled 1,500,000 outstanding shares of our Common Stock and changed our management to Mr. DiBiase who also served in management of OXYS. Also, one of our principal shareholders entered into a consulting agreement with OXYS to provide consulting services during the transition. The OXYS SEA was effective on July 28, 2017, and our name was changed to “IIOT-OXYS, Inc.” at that time. Effective October 26, 2017, our domicile was changed from New Jersey to Nevada.
 
On December 14, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “HereLab SEA”) with HereLab, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HereLab”), and HereLab’s two shareholders pursuant to which we would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of HereLab in exchange for the issuance of 1,650,000 shares of our Common Stock, on a pro rata basis, to HereLab’s two shareholders. The closing of the transaction occurred on January 11, 2018 and HereLab became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
At the present time, we have two, wholly-owned subsidiaries which are OXYS Corporation and HereLab, Inc., through which our operations are conducted.
 
General Overview
 
IIOT-OXYS, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and OXYS, were originally established for the purposes of designing, building, testing, and selling Edge Computing systems for the Industrial Internet. Both companies were, and presently are, early stage technology startups that are largely pre-revenue in their development phase. HereLab is also an early-stage technology development company. The Company received its first revenues in the last quarter of 2017, and expects considerable revenue due to its business development pipeline for 2018 including first 2018 revenues to be realized in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Our unique value proposition is as follows:
 
Edge Computing
 
Within the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”), most companies right now are adopting an approach which sends all sensor data to the cloud for processing. OXYS specializes in edge computing, where the data processing is done locally right where the data is collected.
Advanced Algorithms
 
OXYS has sought to differentiate itself by licensing advanced algorithms from world-leading research institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). These algorithms are an essential part of the edge computing strategy that convert raw data into actionable knowledge right where the data is collected without having to send the data to the cloud first.
Reconfigurable Hardware and Software
 
Instead of focusing on creating tools, OXYS uses open source tools to create proprietary content. More specifically, OXYS uses hardware manufactured by companies such as HARTING (www.harting-usa.com) as well as others. This hardware is reconfigurable and flexible.

OXYS History and Operations
 
In August 2016, OXYS was formed based on the value proposition above and, despite developing the business, including generating revenues, OXYS still remains an early-stage technology startup. The OXYS technology, which we have licensed, consists of three offerings:
 

· | EdgeTelligence ® is our Edge computing platform currently based on the HARTING MICA hardware platform;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EdgeRune ® is our analysis software; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | EdgeMap® is our consulting service template.
--+---------------------------------------------

 
Based on initial business development discussions and extensive discussions with various industry contacts and industry experts, several market areas were identified as potential early markets for the OXYS technology. These various areas are enumerated below:
 
Industrial Equipment
 
Starting with simple energy measurements and going all the way to online, real time determination of part and process quality, the monitoring of so-called “brownfield” industrial equipment represents a very significant market. There are millions of machine tools worldwide that could benefit from such monitoring. Any IIoT solution for industrial equipment must be at a price point that is lower than the cost of replacement of the programmable logic controller (“PLC”). OXYS management determined in August 2016 that the price point of such a device must be between $2,000 and $5,000 for the initial cost with an annual maintenance fee in addition.
Structural Health Monitoring
 
OXYS management determined that the monitoring of civil infrastructure represents a significant opportunity for the implementation of IIoT solutions based on the OXYS technology. There are tens of thousands of bridges across the U.S. that are deemed “structurally deficient.” Other structures include tunnels, pilings in rivers, dams, levees, etc. OXYS management set this as a strategic initiative in September 2016.
 
Agricultural and Environmental IoT
 
This was one of the early adopter industries that had demonstrated use cases and associated business cases. OXYS management started looking for potential partners in this area in October 2016 and had initial conversations with HereLab in December 2016.
 
Medical IoT
 
The emergency room is a bewildering place with dozens of unconnected devices. Data overload is common, and this is one contributing cause of the over 200,000 ER deaths occurring in the U.S. every year.1 There are other applications involving patient care and monitoring both within the hospital as well as extended care facilities. OXYS management determined that this was a strategic area of focus in December 2016.
 
As a result of these initial decisions taken by OXYS management, during the first six months after OXYS was formed in 2016, the following activities, proposals, and technical efforts were undertaken during the calendar years 2016, 2017, and 2018. These activities are indicative of the status of OXYS as an early-stage technology startup company that is now realizing revenues and anticipates to realize both revenues and profits within calendar year 2018.
 
2016 OXYS Technical Development Activities, Customers, and Proposals
 
Smart Grid
 
The first business activity undertaken by OXYS management was the potential application of Edge Computing to the smart grid. The specific problem OXYS management attempted to solve was the measurement of current and voltage for a terminal block in a substation. Within such a substation, there could be hundreds of such terminal blocks each with dozens of interconnections. The IoT objective was to wirelessly transmit current and voltage measurements terminal by terminal so that potential problems could be identified before they cascade into a failure that could cause a blackout or loss of service.

During the final quarter of 2016, OXYS management developed a hardware and software solution that was capable of making the requisite measurements. Advanced Edge computing algorithms were developed on low level embedded systems (FPGAs) as well as general purpose code written in Python and Java. Development was a joint effort between OXYS management and a third party, who also engaged outside contractors. No funds were exchanged as this was a joint development where each party bore its own expenses with the expectation of revenue sharing upon product sale. A complete systems level design of the OXYS/Interactive Machines solution was presented on December 18, 2016 to the potential customer, a large utility company in the northeastern U.S. Although the utility company was favorably impressed, they ultimately decided not to adopt the proposal as they chose to develop their own in-house system instead. Therefore, this significant design and development activity did not lead to commercial orders. In addition, no written agreement was entered into by OXYS and the third party for the joint development.
 
Monitoring of 3D Printing of Metal
 
OXYS management has significant previous experience in the 3D printing of metal. The technical challenge of 3D printing of metal is that it is very difficult to determine the quality of each layer as it is deposited. Therefore, advanced quality control and monitoring strategies are always important for 3D printing. OXYS management believes that OXYS technology can offer an easy means of getting the data collected by the 3D printing machine itself onto a cloud-based platform so it can be further analyzed or compared to data from other machines and other plants. In October 2016, OXYS management approached a company specializing in 3D printing quality control, to conduct joint development activities. In October 2016, OXYS management presented a jointly-developed solution at the Smart Industry 2016 Conference held in Chicago, Illinois. The initially envisioned launch customer for this jointly-developed technology was a large German manufacturer of 3D printing equipment. After being presented the technology, the German company felt that it was a good solution, but decided not to immediately move forward at that time; however, our partner continues to speak with several other manufacturers of equipment in Germany and Belgium regarding the technology. We believe this project is still potentially viable and continues to be on our list of projects for business development by management. No written agreement was entered into by OXYS and the partner who assisted with the development of the technology.
 
Machine Monitoring
 
As mentioned previously, machine monitoring, and especially machine monitoring of older machine tools is a major market for IoT and continues to be one of our business development focus areas. After significant research activity, OXYS management decided to use an edge gateway and computing device made by a German company. Also in collaboration with the German company, OXYS management approached a large machine tool manufacturer in Ohio regarding the monitoring of a machine tool used to make critical drive train and steering components for automotive production. The machine tool company in question wanted a demo unit installed in their facility, which would then lead to orders that at that time were estimated to be up to 10 per month where each unit could be sold for $3,000-$5,000, depending on configuration. In December 2016, a demo unit was successfully deployed to the customer factory in Ohio. The customer was pleased and in January 2017 they requested a quotation, which management provided. The quote was a per unit price of what it would take to instrument up to 10 machines per month. The quote was submitted in February 2017. In May 2017, OXYS management learned after significant and regular follow up efforts that the engineer at the company in charge of this project had left. In addition, the company experienced financial hardship during the first half of 2017 and has now refocused its strategic efforts to focus on profitability. This project is therefore still of interest but is currently on hold and will be revisited by OXYS in 2018.
Funding Raising and Gotham Letter of Intent
 
As a result of successful initial validation of its value proposition, OXYS management sought means to expand the operations of OXYS as well as raise additional funds that would be needed to expand said activities. The initial funding of OXYS was conducted through a private placement for a total investment of $684,500. Over 95% of these funds were received from investors in 2016, and the balance of the funds were received by March 2017. This initial financing was expected to fund initial development activities as well as gain sufficient early adopter traction to justify a larger future raise. Evidenced by the successful market reception in 2016, OXYS management decided to proceed with a fund-raising strategy that would allow raising greater funds. OXYS management decided to seek possible entry into the OTC Markets which resulted in the completion of the reverse merger with the Company on July 28, 2017.

2017 OXYS Technical Development Activities, Customers, and Proposals
 
HereLab Acquisition
 
OXYS management was able to validate several of the unique value propositions of OXYS during 2016, and these activities were significantly expanded during 2017. OXYS continued its operations as an early stage technology startup and expanded its activities considerably. Because of the success experienced in 2016, OXYS management sought to both expand the customer base as well as launch new initiatives, mainly structural health monitoring, in addition to those developed in 2016. Additionally, the entire area of Medical IoT was investigated by OXYS management in 2017 and key strategic partnerships were put into place. There was a significant acquisition by the Company which was initiated in 2017 and was completed in early 2018, namely that of HereLab, another early-stage technology startup. HereLab acquired several key early adopter customers in 2017 and these are now part of the customer base for the Company. As of the date of this filing, HereLab is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the President of HereLab, Patrick Phillips, serves as a Director and Vice President of Product Management for the Company.
Automotive Edge Device and User Interface
 
In April 2017, a large automotive manufacturer that is headquartered in Asia but that has extensive operations in the U.S. approached HARTING for a specific application involving edge devices and edge computing. HARTING then approached OXYS and the joint team met with this automotive manufacturer in May 2017. A final specification for the devices to be made was developed in June 2017. A purchase order was issued July of 2017. OXYS designed, built, tested and delivered 24 edge computing units with user interfaces to the experimental manufacturing technology center recently built by this large automotive company in Kentucky. The final installation was completed and accepted in September 2017. The resulting revenue was just under $40,000. This project provided valuable lessons learned which are guiding current product development. Management is presently developing a second-generation edge device internally and at the Company’s own cost which is of significant interest to this automotive company as well as to the entire automotive component manufacturing industry. It is expected to roll out during the second quarter of 2018. A technical services agreement was reached; however, management does not deem it material at this time. OXYS retains rights to market and sell the product to others, but the customer has rights to use the source code within their own facility.
Machine Monitor and Energy Monitor
 
Another large automotive manufacturer which was originally an American company and has a major presence in the Detroit area approached OXYS in 2017 for a demo for machine energy monitoring. The monitoring of energy provides multiple benefits and insights. Firstly, it reveals energy usage patterns right at the machine tool and not averaged over the entire plant. This immediately flags abnormal energy profiles that could be the result of poor machine maintenance or a sudden change in the manufacturing process. Secondly, the raw voltage and current data can be used as a machine health monitor as well as a process health monitor by implementing the advanced edge algorithms that the Company has licensed from MIT. The initial request for a demonstration of the OXYS technology came in August 2017. OXYS personnel visited the plant location in October 2017 to get the final specifications and requirements. The energy monitoring demo was designed, built, and tested by OXYS and was then installed in November 2017 at the factory site. The demo was very favorably received, and a small initial order for three units (consisting of hardware and software) was requested in December 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, OXYS personnel have been working with the automotive manufacturer’s information technology (IT) department to get permission for wireless data communications within the plant using OXYS devices and sensors. This request was approved, and work is now proceeding to fulfill the initial order. Management expects that this initial order could lead to dozens of additional units in 2018 with this one manufacturer, and hundreds of additional units within the automotive industry as a whole. The initial price of these units is approximately $3,000 plus an annual maintenance agreement for every installed unit.
Structural Health Monitoring
 
As identified by management, structural health monitoring is a major area of focus, opportunity, and sales and revenue potential. During June and July 2017, OXYS management had extensive discussions with a Department of Transportation of a state in New England regarding the monitoring of bridges. In particular, there is a strong interest and need for the monitoring of so-called box beam concrete bridges. There are hundreds of thousands of such bridges across the U.S. In August 2017, management submitted its first proposal for the monitoring of a bridge near a major New England city. The proposal was favorably received; however, the bridge replacement ended up being accelerated and the monitoring did not take place. Through the rest of 2017, management worked with this state government to identify a new project that could be suitable for monitoring. Such a project was found in December 2017 and consists of three separate concrete box beam bridges which are located all within a few miles of one another in the central part of this New England state. A proposal for the monitoring of these bridges was submitted in January 2018. We recently received a subcontract to begin work and work is in progress at the time of this filing. Several other projects have been identified by management and structural health monitoring is expected to be a major source of revenue for the Company during 2018 and beyond.

HereLab Joint work and Acquisition
 
Beginning in 2017 and continuing in the future, OXYS had been working with HereLab, first on a consulting basis and eventually through acquisition as part of the Company itself. OXYS management originally engaged HereLab on a consulting basis for the development of a Structural Health Monitoring (“SHM”) node in April 2017. This led to the joint development of an intelligent edge device node that could be generalized. By June of 2017, the joint team was implementing accelerometers to existing HereLab hardware. The team also developed firmware in C++ for low power telemetry. Preliminary tests of the SHM node were successfully conducted in July 2017. Starting in September 2017, management directed OXYS to work on automotive IIoT in collaboration with OXYS student interns (three paid interns worked with OXYS from May 2017 to December 2017). HereLab closely supported the OXYS automotive IIoT deliveries in October 2017 and November 2017. Based on these early successes, the Company entered into a letter of intent to acquire HereLab in October 2017 and completed the acquisition in January 2018. Currently, HereLab has $157,000 in revenue potential in terms of projects in various states of delivery. This is expected to be realized by the end of the second quarter of 2018. We estimate that there is an additional $250,000+ in the business development pipeline for HereLab independent of other activities occurring in OXYS.
 
HereLab Business Description
 
HereLab was incorporated as a privately held Delaware corporation in February 2017. HereLab is based in and has operated only in the U.S. HereLab is also a startup and an early-stage technology company. HereLab had revenues in 2017 and, based on customer interest/feedback and existing contracts that could be expanded to encompass this additional business, is expecting a significant increase in activity and revenue in 2018 as it more fully monetizes its developments, now as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
HereLab consists of two founders and 2-4 full time equivalent (FTE) contractors for engineering and design services. HereLab’s founder resides in the U.S. and its engineer resides in the United Kingdom.
 
HereLab is an environmental IoT hardware and software company, acting primarily as an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”). HereLab designs radio-enabled/internet connected hardware for market, designs radio-enabled hardware for other customers, integrates sensors for soil, air, water and built environments, designs firmware and manages design for manufacture activities for customers.
 
During the prior year of activity, HereLab has designed multiple prototypes and products for major sensor manufacturers, global integrated circuit corporations, agricultural data aggregators and several independent startup companies.
 
HereLab focused 2017 design and design for manufacture OEM activity on agricultural sensing — row crop, specialty crop and pivot crops.
 
HereLab has worked with international suppliers and contract manufacturers. Distribution of HereLab’s products is typically done through a by-PO basis through the contract manufacturer.
 
Agricultural applications provide a typical business workflow example. HereLab typically works with a customer to design an application-specific hardware design — for corn, or hazelnuts or row crops — which requires an understanding of the environment and the data required. HereLab then designs a prototype for deployment and testing. From that prototype a product bill of materials is produced and sent to a manufacturer for quote. Once quoted, the customer supplies a purchase order to the company.
 
HereLab is now maturing beyond design for prototype services to design for manufacture. At this stage, HereLab’s revenues will expand from design consulting to a per unit wholesale markup for multiple customers.
 
We believe the acquisition of HereLab is one of mutual benefit. HereLab provides hardware and firmware development services not just for environmental IoT as described above but for industrial applications as well.
 
In total, HereLab has designed hardware/firmware platforms for long range radio enabled IoT nodes for over 35 sensors for hydrology, soil moisture, flood, irrigation, architectural applications, airborne gas detection, light, sound, temperature and humidity detection among others.
 
HereLab has spent a significant amount of its own time developing solutions. This activity could be called R&D. It is estimated that 20% of HereLab’s time in total is spent developing solutions and 80% is spent on customer-centered solutions. Of that 80%, 25% is design-development.

-

 

Materials for production are supplied by global distributors (Digi-Key, Arrow) or are acquired by contract manufacture, direct from the manufacturer.
 
While HereLab’s agricultural applications largely cycle around spring/fall cycles, its other products and services have no such seasonality.
 
HereLab currently has no patents. HereLab does anticipate working directly with the Company on technology it has licensed for energy monitoring.
 
HereLab maintains no inventory of product and only acquires sufficient raw material to design and build prototypes, test hardware/enclosure requirements in the process of developing a final bill of materials for the product.
 
HereLab works directly with multiple customers in-channel to design and develop product. Thereby, the company-customer relationship is crucial. HereLab considers channel partners as potential value-chain partners as well. For example, HereLab will discount design services and “share” wholesale value in order to: 1) spread value among customers, 2) build customer loyalty, and 3) create private-label and HereLab label products.
 
HereLab has diversified to multiple customer types and will continue to be conduct business as a design-build OEM across multiple industry verticals.
 
Project and Revenue Outlook for 2018
 
On the books and in the plans for 2018, the Company presently has nearly a dozen projects for nine different customers in a wide range of industries including automotive, aerospace, state government, primary metal working, agriculture, and forest products. The Company, therefore, has a broad customer base and does not excessively rely on any one customer for revenue in 2018 and beyond.

Casting – Primary Metal Working
 
Through a partner, namely Barrett Electric, OXYS has submitted proposals for machine monitoring to a casting facility located in New England. This casting facility runs melting furnaces which expend considerable energy and therefore energy management is a key consideration. OXYS equipment will allow this facility to actively monitor its energy usage and reduce usage by identifying process inefficiencies. Proposals are presently under review and contract award, if selected, is expected in the second quarter of 2018. An agreement is expected to be reached with Barrett Electric during the second quarter of 2018.
Lumber Industry – Saw Mills
 
In Northern New England and elsewhere in North America, the lumber industry is a major local economic driving force. The largest variable cost for the lumber industry is energy and electricity is the dominant mode of energy used. Management is again working with Barrett Electric to identify opportunities to sell machine monitoring systems to lumber mills to reduce energy consumption. Several lumber mills have been identified and exploratory proposals have been submitted. Contract award, if selected, is expected in the second quarter of 2018.

Agricultural Customers
 
HereLab has six projects that are already under contract and are scheduled for delivery in 2018. These projects include rain buckets, soil moisture sensors, irrigation control systems, and several design projects where HereLab will design components for other customers and will receive a royalty stream for use of their designs. HereLab is serving four different customers with these six projects. Additionally, HereLab has several exploratory proposals out to customers and contract award, if selected, is expected in the second and third quarters of 2018. A license agreement is expected during the second quarter of 2018.
Structural Health Monitoring Customers 
 
As previously mentioned, OXYS has received permission to proceed with a bridge monitoring project for a large New England state. The initial project will consist of monitoring three different bridges that are close together. Project technical work is expected to begin in March 2018. In addition, there are two other projects for which exploratory proposals have been submitted. The first is a tunnel monitoring project in a large city in New England. The second is a river flow and depth monitoring project for a river located in New England near the costal region. Both of these projects, if awarded, would begin in the second quarter of 2018.
Marketing
 
Our marketing and sales efforts are divided into several distinct categories:
 

1) | Working with technical partners who have larger sales forces;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Direct business development and discussions with end use customers by company management;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Working with distribution channel partners who can leverage their existing sales channels for increased visibility; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Trade shows and international technical, sales and marketing meetings.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although the present expenditures on marketing and sales have been modest (less than 10% of expenditures) they are expected to increase in 2018, and we expect to hire a business development manager after the next funding to coordinate and focus our marketing and sales efforts.
 
Competition
 
There are two principal sources of competition to us. The first comes from large companies such as IBM, GE, Amazon, Google etc. who all have their efforts in IIoT. However, these large companies are cloud – computing centric and they are trying to move towards edge devices from their present position of being solely cloud computing based. We will be starting in edge computing from day one as opposed to force-fitting a cloud based solution into the limited computational capability and storage space of an edge device. We believe our systems will be more computationally efficient as compared to a cloud-based solution which requires more computational resources. We also believe our systems will embody the unique algorithms that we have licensed from MIT and seek to license from such research institutions as the National Labs.
 
Most of the IIoT implementations involve data going from sensor to cloud. This involves sending vast amounts of data to the cloud and then processing this data there. This takes a large computational footprint (many processors) and a large memory requirement to store the data. From our actual experience and according to many technical experts in the field (see for example the discussion on edge data in “Structural Health Monitoring” A Machine Learning Perspective,” by C.R. Farrar and K. Worden, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 2013) , a better approach is to use Edge Computing. Edge computing takes the raw data, which could be MB or GB per second, and extracts features. Features are attributes of the signal that preserve the essential physics of the signal but reduce the data density by a very large amount (up to a factor of one million). After the feature extraction step, the data has a data rate of approximately 10KB or 100KB per second. Next comes the classification step, which further reduces data by classifying data into at least two bins: nominal behavior or off-nominal or abnormal behavior. For example, in monitoring a machine tool in a factory, if the machine tool is behaving normally, there is nothing to report and therefore no data needs to be sent or transferred anywhere. Only the abnormal condition data needs to be sent along with a description of the problem. This is what Edge Computing accomplishes and it accomplishes this right where the data is being collected using relatively small computational and memory resources (For example our systems have a 1GHz processor and 1 few GB of RAM plus up to 32 GB of storage – which is less computational power than the average smart phone.). so considering all of these technical aspects, we are able to assert that our Edge Computing process is more efficient in terms of computational power and memory as compared to a cloud-based solution, that it only sends along the information (not just data) that is really needed, and it can still interact with cloud based services to provide data sharing across different platforms.

The second source of competition is from startups who are in the edge computing space. The most prominent example is Foghorn Systems Inc. There will be additional startups that will specifically target the edge computing space as the investor awareness and the technical focus shifts from cloud computing to edge computing. Whereas other startups focus on development of proprietary tools for edge computing, our solutions will use open source tools but will still create proprietary algorithms and software content for clients and customers. We feel this methodology of creating proprietary solutions using open source tools will allow us to rapidly address current and future customer needs.
 
Government Regulation
 
At present, we do not require any governmental approvals of any our products or services.
 
Environmental Laws
 
At present, we are not regulated by any environmental laws.
 
Research and Development
 
Other than expenses for legal, accounting, audit, tax preparation, intellectual property (IP), and other overhead expenses such rent, the vast majority of our funds are spent on technology development, product development, and research and development. We are an emerging growth, early-stage, technology company and, as such, most of our expenditures are aimed at innovation and product development.
 
We have a technology maturation model so that we avoid doing work on technologies that are too early and too new and belong in a pure search environment. We rely heavily on our research partners such as universities and National Labs for such early stage work. When the technology is ready to leave the lab, we take over the further development. Along the way we expect to file additional IP and otherwise protect technology by using trademarks, for example.
 
The efforts in research and development have already resulted in significant customer interest in various market verticals including industrial, automotive, aerospace, agricultural, infrastructure, and power generation. In 2017, one successful product sale occurred from this development and, as discussed elsewhere in this filing, product revenue as a direct result of our research and development activities is expected to grow in 2018 and onwards.
 
All the present projects that we are working on internally as research and development projects will go forward, so we do not have any projects in the category of projects that have incurred significant expense but that will not result in present or future product.
 
Intellectual Property
 
As mentioned before, a critical business strategy for edge computing is advanced algorithms. One such family of advanced algorithms comes from MIT from the Research Lab for Electronics. These algorithms are called non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). Just by monitoring current, voltage and power, inferences about the behavior of the system to which the power is being supplied could be made. For example, in a factory, every major piece of equipment has its own characteristic startup, running, and shutdown signature. By closely examining these, not only can activity in the factory be actively tracked, but potential machine anomalies could also be detected.
 
On February 5, 2018, we entered into a Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). The agreement, which is effective February 1, 2018, grants to us a royalty-bearing non-exclusive license under U.S. Patent Nos. 8344724 (“Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Power and Other Parameters” issued January 1, 2013), 14/263407 (“Non-Intrusive Monitoring” filed April 28, 2014), and Patent Cooperation Treaty Serial No. PCT/US2016/057165 (“Noncontact Power Sensing” filed October 14, 2016) during the term of the agreement. The term of the agreement is from the effective date until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications licensed pursuant to the agreement, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the agreement.
 
Under the agreement, we are required to make a first commercial sale of a “LICENSED PRODUCT” and/or a first commercial performance of a “LICENSED PROCESS,” as defined in the agreement, on or before September 30, 2018. We have negotiated revenue targets with MIT which will determine annual royalty payments. The 2018 minimum revenue target for the sale of products and services incorporating the MIT technology is $100,000. This minimum revenue amount will increase in subsequent years.

Within 30 days of invoicing, a non-refundable license issue fee of $10,000 is to be paid by us to MIT. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay to MIT additional patent maintenance fees in years beyond 2018.
 
Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay to MIT a running royalty of 2% of “NET SALES,” as defined in the agreement made in the calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020. For “NET SALES” made in the calendar year 2021 and every calendar year thereafter through the term of the agreement, we are required to pay to MIT a running royalty of 4%.
 
Management is also currently pursuing several additional licensing deals with National Laboratories, but the terms of these agreements are not able to be disclosed at this time. Lastly, management applied for and was granted several trademarks including EdgeTelligence®, EdgeMap®, EdgeRune®, and MakerSafe® to represent the range of products and services that the Company has developed or is the process of currently developing.
 
Employees
 
We have no full or part-time employees; however, we do have contractor employees (1099 basis) who are working daily on the core business activities of the business and have been doing so since the beginning of the business formation. During the second quarter of 2018, we plan on transitioning contractors such as Patrick Phillips, Nevan Hanumara, and Giro DiBiase to a W-2 basis. Nevan Hanumara, our CEO and sole executive officer, currently devotes approximately 30 hours a week to our business. Mr. Hanumara’s involvement in other efforts such as with CambridgeMedSpace LLC is not taking a significant portion of his time and is on an advisory basis. At the present time, there are no conflicts of interest between the Company and any of our contract employees. This was determined as follows: i) none of their outside activities are soliciting business from our customers or business contacts; ii) they are not soliciting our investors to invest in other ventures; and iii) they are not soliciting our contract employees to leave us and join other efforts. In 2018 we anticipate hiring 3-5 full time employees. At present, all our business services are provided by outside contractors.
