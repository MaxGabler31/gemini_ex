Item 1. Business.
History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in August 1998 under the name “Network Acquisitions, Inc.” We changed our name to Cavion Technologies, Inc. in February 1999 and subsequently to Concord Ventures, Inc. in October 2006.
 
On December 21, 2000, we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the filing, on February 16, 2001, we sold our entire business, and all of our assets, for the benefit of our creditors. After the sale, we still had liabilities of $8.4 million and were subsequently dismissed by the Court from the Chapter 11 reorganization, effective March 13, 2001, at which time the last of our remaining directors resigned. On March 13, 2001, we had no business or other source of income, no assets, no employees or directors, outstanding liabilities of approximately $8.4 million and had terminated our duty to file reports under securities law. In February 2008, we were re-listed on the OTC Bulletin Board.
 
In April 2010, we re-domiciled in Delaware under the name CCVG, Inc. (“CCVG”). Effective December 31, 2010, CCVG completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization y (the “Reorganization") which provided for the merger of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result of this reorganization our name was changes to “Golden Dragon Inc.”, which became the surviving publicly quoted parent holding company.
 
On May 9, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with CannaPharmaRX, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Canna Colorado”), and David Cutler, a former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director of our Company. Under the Share Purchase Agreement, Canna Colorado purchased 1,421,120 shares of our common stock from Mr. Cutler and an additional 9,000,000 restricted common shares directly from us.
 
On May 15, 2014, as amended and effective January 29, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger”) pursuant to which Canna Colorado became a subsidiary of our Company. In October 2014, we changed our legal name to “CannaPharmaRx, Inc.”
 
Pursuant to the Merger, all of the shares of our common stock previously owned by Canna Colorado were cancelled. As a result of the aforesaid transactions we became an early-stage pharmaceutical company whose purpose was to advance cannabinoid research and discovery using proprietary formulation and drug delivery technology then under development. 
 
In April 2016, we ceased operations. Our then management resigned their respective positions with our Company, with the exception of Mr. Gary Herick, who remains as one of our officers and directors.

As a result, we are now considered a “shell” company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Following is an explanation as to how we intend to proceed in the foreseeable future.
 
Plan of Operation
 
As of the date of this Report we intend to engage in what we believe to be synergistic acquisitions or joint ventures with a company or companies that we believe will enhance our business plan. Ultimately, our intent is to become a national or internationally branded cannabis cultivation company, or otherwise engage in the cannabis industry. However, if an opportunity in another industry arises we will review that opportunity as well. One of the benefits to our being a reporting and publicly traded company, is to allow us to utilize our securities as consideration for some, or all of the purchase price of these potential acquisitions. There are no assurances we will be able to consummate any acquisitions using our securities as consideration, or at all.
 
There are numerous things that will need to occur in order to allow us to implement this aspect of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan.
 
Management will seek out and evaluate businesses for acquisition. The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards. Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidate’s business. If we are successful in our attempts to acquire a company or companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, asset purchase, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management and shareholders will no longer be in control of our Company.
 
As part of our investigation, our officers and directors will meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an acquisition will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and other parties, the management of the acquisition candidate and our relative negotiation strength.
 
We will participate in an acquisition only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
Depending upon the nature of the acquisition, including the financial condition of the acquisition company, as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“34 Act “), it will be necessary for such acquisition candidate to provide independent audited financial statements. We will not acquire any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the 34 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the agreement will also contain a provision providing for the acquisition entity to reimburse us for all costs associated with the proposed transaction.

As of the date of this Report we are engaged in discussions with various companies but there are no assurances that these discussions will result in any definitive agreement. There is no significant material acquisition that is probable to be consummated and there are no assurances that any such acquisition will occur in the future.
 
We believe there are certain perceived benefits to being a public company whose securities are publicly traded, including the following:
 

· | increased visibility in the financial community;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | increased valuation;
--+---------------------


· | greater ease in raising capital;
--+---------------------------------


· | compensation of key employees through stock options for which there may be a market valuation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhanced corporate image.
--+--------------------------



There are also certain perceived disadvantages to being a trading company including the following:
 

· | required publication of corporate information;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | required filings of periodic and episodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Business entities, if any, which may be interested in a combination with us may include the following:
 

· | a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a company which wishes to become public with less dilution of its securities than would occur upon an underwriting;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a company seeking one or more of the other perceived benefits of becoming a public company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A business combination with a private company will normally involve the transfer to the private company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cannapharmarx, Inc. and the substitution by the private company of its own management and board of directors.
 
The proposed business activities described herein classify us as a “shell company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and certain states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations regarding the sales of securities of shell companies, as well as limitations on a shareholder’s ability to sell their “restricted” securities. Rule 144 is not available to a shareholder of a shell company unless and until the Company files a registration statement with the SEC that includes certain specific information about existing business operations of a registrant and thereafter must wait an additional one year to take advantage of that exemption from registration.

Rule 12b-2 of the 34 Act defines a shell company as a company that has:
 
(1) No or nominal operations; and
 (2) Either:
 (i) No or nominal assets;
 (ii) Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or
 (iii) Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.
 
We will continue to file all reports required of us under the Exchange Act until a business combination has occurred, or we organically build our business from cash raised from investors. A business combination will normally result in a change in control and management of our Company. Since a principal benefit of a business combination with us would normally be considered our status as a reporting company, it is anticipated that we will continue to file reports under the Exchange Act following a business combination. No assurance can be given that this will occur or, if it does, for how long.
Employees
 
During 2017 and as of the date of this report we have no employees except our current management. See “Part III, Item 10, Management” below.
 
Competition
 
We are competing with other publicly held companies who are also seeking to acquire or otherwise consolidate with an existing business. We believe that the only thing that may separate us from these competitors is our interest in the cannabis industry, but there are no assurances that this provides any competitive edge. Most of our competitors have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.
Intellectual Property
 
We currently do not hold any patents or patent applications. We hold one registered trademark, RECRUIT Registry™. This report contains additional trademarks, service marks, or trade names of others. Our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, service marks or trade names is not intended to imply and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement of, such parties. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from business partners and other third parties that receive our confidential information.

Government Regulation
 
While we do not own any properties, including any cannabis related assets, it is our intention to emphasize the cannabis industry in our search for business opportunities. While there are no assurances that we will successfully acquire a company or assets related to the cannabis industry, or any industry, if we are so successful we will be subject to significant governmental regulations. Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the Federal Government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the Federal Government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
As of the date of this report, there are 30 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana, with Texas being the most recent state to add a medical initiative. Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts have all approved legalization of cannabis for adult use. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws will cause significant financial damage to us.
 
Previously, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration has revised this policy. Specifically, the Attorney General vacated the Cole Memorandum in favor of deferral of any enforcement of federal regulation to the individual states Department of Justice/US Attorney. However, certain other protections remain in place via budgetary element embedment (Rohrabacher-Farr amendment now referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment), which limits funding of any enforcement of anti-cannabis legislation. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:
 

• | the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the growing of marijuana on public lands; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | marijuana possession or use on federal property.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, federally chartered banks will not accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for our clients to operate. There does appears to be recent movement to allow state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to the industry, but as of the date of this Prospectus there are only nominal entities that have been formed that offer these services.

Although cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in many states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plan and could expose us and our management to potential criminal liability and subject their properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent states from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. However, state laws do not supersede the prohibitions set forth in the federal drug laws.
 
For a comprehensive and up to date perspective on this process and current states and territories cannabis laws please refer to the following link: http://www.mpp.org/states/key-marijuana-policy-reform.html
 
In order to participate in either the medical or recreational sides of the marijuana industry in Colorado and elsewhere, all businesses and employees must obtain licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. Colorado issues four types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.
 
Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of marijuana businesses. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements, and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business.
