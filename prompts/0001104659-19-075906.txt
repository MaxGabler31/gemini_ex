ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
General  Dynasil Corporation of America was founded as a New Jersey corporation in 1960 and incorporated in the state of Delaware through a migratory merger in March 2008. Our corporate headquarters are located at 313 Washington Street, Suite 403, Newton, MA 02458, and our corporate website is www.dynasil.com. You can access, free of charge, our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any other amendments to those reports, through a link at our website, or at the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov.
  We have the following three reporting segments based on our main operating activities:
 

· | Optics: The Optics segment encompasses four business units – Dynasil Fused Silica, Evaporated Metal Films, Hilger Crystals, and Optometrics – that manufacture commercial products, including optical crystals for sensing in the security and medical imaging markets, as well as optical components, optical coatings and optical materials for scientific instrumentation and other applications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovation and Development: The Innovation and Development segment (formerly known as the Contract Research segment) consists of the Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (“RMD”) business unit, which is among the largest small business participants in United States (“U.S.”) government-funded research. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Biomedical: The Biomedical segment consists of a single business unit, Dynasil Biomedical Corporation (“Dynasil Biomedical”), a medical technology incubator which owns rights to certain early stage medical technologies. In October 2013, Dynasil Biomedical formed Xcede Technologies, Inc. (“Xcede”), a joint venture with Mayo Clinic, to spin out and separately fund the development of a tissue sealant technology. At September 30, 2019, Dynasil Biomedical owned approximately 63% of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Xcede, thus Xcede is included in our consolidated financial statements. Dynasil Biomedical currently has no operations other than those relating to its equity ownership in Xcede, whose operations were substantially curtailed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Segment information appearing in Note 16 – Segment, Customer and Geographical Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements is also presented on this basis.
 
Our business strategy is based on continued development of products in our Optics segment, as well as organic growth of existing Optics products, development and expansion of our funded research portfolio, investment in the commercialization of the technologies originating from our Innovation and Development segment, continuing development of the Xcede medical technologies, and acquisitions that align with our core competencies.
 
As previously disclosed, following a special meeting of Dynasil’s stockholders on August 7, 2019, the Company filed certificates of amendment to our certificate of incorporation and subsequently effected a 1-for-8,000 reverse stock split of our common stock, par value $0.0005 per share (the “Reverse Stock Split”), followed immediately by a 8,000-for-1 forward stock split of its common stock (the “Forward Stock Split,” and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the “Transaction”). In regards to the Transaction, stockholders with fewer than 8,000 shares of Dynasil common stock held of record immediately before the Transaction became entitled to receive cash payments in lieu of fractional shares equal to $1.15 per pre-Reverse Stock Split share. As a result of the Transaction, 2,825,268 shares of common stock were due to be exchanged for cash, totaling approximately $3,249,000.
 
Following the Transaction, the Company filed a Form 25 and Forms 15 with the SEC indicating our intent to delist and deregister our stock. Following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, therefore, the Company will cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements.

Historical Growth by Acquisition
 
Through a series of acquisitions beginning in March 2005, Dynasil has evolved from a single product line optics company to one focused on multiple optical product lines and a significant contract research business focused on advanced materials used in radiation detection and other advanced instrumentation. Our revenue has increased from $2 million in FY 2004 to $44 million in FY 2019.
  The acquisitions we completed during this period included:
 

· | Optometrics: In March 2005, we acquired Optometrics LLC (“Optometrics”), a worldwide supplier of optical components and instruments, including diffraction gratings, interference filters, monochromators, laser optics and specialized optical systems. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evaporated Metal Films: In October 2006, we acquired Evaporated Metal Films Corporation (“EMF”), an optical thin-film coatings company with a broad range of application markets, including solar energy, display systems, dental photography, optical instruments, satellite communications and lighting. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RMD: In July 2008, we acquired Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (“RMD”), a contract research company with expertise in material science, radiation detection, digital imaging technology, magnetic imaging, laser optics and photonics. The team at RMD develops advanced technology in materials, sensors and prototype instruments that detect or measure radiation, light, magnetism or sound for use in security, medical and industrial applications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hilger Crystals: In July 2010, we acquired Hilger Crystals, Ltd., (“Hilger”) a manufacturer of synthetic crystals applicable to a wide range of industrial, medical, and homeland security applications with a long history of supplying high-quality synthetic crystals for infrared spectroscopy, X-ray and gamma ray detection. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Biomedical technologies: In April 2011, we acquired the rights to six early stage biomedical technologies from Dr. Daniel Ericson, a former hematologist at the Mayo Clinic, which jointly owns rights to certain of the technologies acquired. The activity of our Biomedical segment is currently focused on the development of the tissue sealant technology that was part of this transaction in its Xcede subsidiary. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DichroTec Thin Films: In June 2014, our EMF subsidiary acquired the assets of DichroTec Thin Films LLC, another optical thin-film coatings company with a broad range of applications, many of which are similar to EMF’s applications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Optical Technology
 
We specialize in the production of optical materials, components and coatings for various applications in the medical, industrial, and homeland security/defense sectors.
 
Our Optics segment supplies synthetic crystals, optical materials, components, and coatings that are used in devices such as baggage scanners, medical imaging systems, optical instruments, lasers, analytical instruments, automotive components, semiconductor/electronic devices, spacecraft/aircraft components and advertising displays. These products are offered through four business units (Dynasil Fused Silica, Optometrics, Hilger and EMF).
 
We compete for business with fabricators of industrial optical materials, other optical components manufacturers, other optical crystal manufacturers and other optical coaters as well as other analytical instruments manufacturers and synthetic crystal manufacturers. We believe our proprietary processes, reputation, specialty product offering, products in development and the price at which we offer our products enable us to successfully compete in these markets. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do, which may enable them to develop and market products that would compete against those developed by us.
 
Our products are distributed through a direct sales and marketing staff of ten people and through other channels, including manufacturer’s representatives and distributors in various foreign countries for international sales and U.S. manufacturers’ representatives for certain product lines. Marketing efforts include direct customer contact through sales visits, advertising in trade publications, attendance at trade shows and our newly designed e-commerce website.

Innovation and Development – the Future of Our Technology 
 
Our former Contract Research segment was recently renamed the Innovation and Development segment to emphasize the new technology that is being developed at this segment’s business unit, RMD, particularly in the fields material science, radiation detection, digital imaging technology, magnetic imaging, laser optics and photonics. Using their expertise in these fields, the team at RMD develops advanced technology in materials, sensors and prototype instruments that detect or measure radiation, light, magnetism or sound for use in security, medical and industrial applications.
 
RMD is among the largest small business participants in U.S. government-funded research, performing research and development activities for government agencies including Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, National Institutes of Health and NASA. For over thirty years, RMD has successfully conducted government research under the auspices of the Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) program. In recent years, RMD has augmented its SBIR research with larger, competitively bid government research and development contracts. To grow our research portfolio within the federal government, we are broadening our relationships within key federal funding agencies and the U.S. military. RMD also provides research for non-governmental entities in areas where it has the appropriate expertise. Such research is currently not a significant portion of RMD’s revenue. Our research initiatives are aligned with our focus on the homeland security, medical and industrial markets. As of September 30, 2019, RMD had a contract backlog of approximately $36.6 million, of which approximately 46% is SBIR contracts. 
 
As of September 30, 2019, our Innovation and Development segment had a total of 78 employees, including 24 Ph.D. level scientists. RMD serves as a vehicle to expand our patent portfolio enabling the opportunity to advance our technology from development to commercialization using government-funded research. As of September 30, 2019, RMD had a portfolio of 75 issued U.S. patents and 31 pending patent applications, compared with 72 issued patents and 40 pending patent applications at the same point in 2018.
 
RMD competes for contract research work against a variety of small and large entities, including universities that submit research proposals based on specific government solicitations. We generate revenue under various types of contracts, which include Cost Reimbursement, Time & Materials (T&M), Fixed Price-Level of Effort and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts. We believe that RMD’s reputation for conducting state-of-the art research and development, as well as the quality of its proposals, are significant competitive advantages. In addition, RMD maintains strong working relationships with universities, government agencies, national laboratories, research hospitals and corporations. However, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may be better able to operate large, well-funded research and development programs.
 
We believe that research projects can provide an important source for new commercial products in areas such as medical imaging, industrial sensors, critical care and point of care diagnostics and homeland security. For example, Dynasil Products’ lead paint analyzer and gamma medical probes businesses, which were sold in fiscal year 2014, emanated from the RMD portfolio. Most recently, our government-funded research work supported the development of our CLYC dual-mode radiation detection technology which we are currently selling commercially.

Biomedical: Xcede and Our Development of a Tissue Sealant Technology
 
Xcede's first product under development is a hemostatic patch (“Xcede Patch”), designed to be biocompatible, to be used when conventional techniques are inadequate or impractical to stop bleeding (hemostasis). As described above, in 2011, Dynasil Biomedical (“DBM”) acquired rights to the underlying tissue sealant technology as part of a transaction with a former hematologist at the Mayo Clinic. Since that time, DBM has invested significant capital developing this tissue sealant technology, including costs to further the related intellectual property rights and to conduct animal studies.
 
Beginning at its inception and through November 2016, Xcede funded its pre-clinical research activities through the issuance of $5.2 million in the aggregate principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at 5% (“the Notes”). In November of 2016, the Notes were converted into Series A convertible preferred stock of Xcede (“Series A Preferred”). Series A Preferred participants include both outside investors (accounted for as noncontrolling interest) and DBM. The outside investors converted $3.1 million of Notes and accrued interest into 3,055,551 shares of Series A Preferred. DBM converted the remaining $2.4 million of Notes and accrued interest into 2,338,569 shares of Series A Preferred.
 
Additionally, DBM invested $1.2 million of cash into Xcede in exchange for Series B convertible preferred stock of Xcede (“Series B Preferred”). Series A Preferred was issued at a 20% discount to the price per share of the Series B Preferred, in accordance with the amended provisions of the Notes. The value of DBM’s Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, as they are wholly owned by DBM, is eliminated in consolidation.
 
Each share of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred (together “the Preferred Stock”) is convertible, at the option of the holder, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Xcede common stock (“Common Stock”) as determined by dividing the original issue price, as defined, by the conversion price in effect on the date of conversion, which is 1:1. Each holder of the Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock that the holder of the Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive upon the conversion of the holder’s Preferred Stock into Common Stock. Upon any liquidation event, which includes certain change of control events, following payment of pre-equity distributions, the remaining proceeds or net assets of Xcede shall be paid and distributed in the following amounts and order of priority: (1) to satisfy the liquidation preference payment due to each holder of Series B Preferred, (2) to satisfy the liquidation preference payment due to each holder of Series A Preferred, (3) payment in full of any acquisition transaction payment, and (4) the remaining assets available to be distributed ratably among the holders of the Common Stock. If a liquidation event were to occur, the Series A Preferred’s liquidation value would be $1.016 per share and Series B Preferred’s liquidation value would be $1.27 per share. As of September 30, 2019, the liquidation value of the Series B Preferred would be approximately $1.5 million and the Series A Preferred would be approximately $5.5 million, of which $2.4 million is DBM’s portion and $3.1 million would be attributed to noncontrolling shareholders.
 
As of September 30, 2019, DBM owned approximately 63% of Xcede’s outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock and, as a result, Xcede is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the Series A Preferred having a liquidation preference and therefore not representing a residual interest, cumulative net losses of Xcede are attributed only to common stockholders in accordance with common stock ownership. Noncontrolling interest represents the value of the Series A Preferred and common stock not owned by DBM plus 17% of cumulative losses of Xcede based on the 17% common stock ownership held by noncontrolling interests.
 
In 2016, Xcede signed agreements with Cook Biotech Inc. (“CBI”) in connection with the development, regulatory approval and production of Xcede’s hemostatic patch (the “Xcede Patch”) in which CBI committed to fund up to $1.5 million for the pre-clinical testing for the Xcede Patch. Xcede utilized $0.5 million in CBI services in exchange for a note that is currently outstanding.

On July 20, 2018, Xcede received a notice of termination from CBI claiming that the results of a recent animal study showed that it is not commercially reasonable, in CBI’s assessment, to continue to the next development phase of the Patch.
 
In light of the foregoing, Xcede has halted clinical trial preparations at this time and has curtailed its operations to a minimal level while the Board of Directors of Xcede evaluates alternatives, including the viability of modifying the Xcede Patch to address the shortcomings cited by CBI and/or the possible sale or license of Xcede IP assets, subject to amending CBI’s security interest. Additionally, Xcede and the Company’s RMD subsidiary have begun an investigation of possible continued development of the Xcede Patch, which includes seeking government funding of this development. In September 2019, Xcede and RMD resubmitted an application for a Phase I SBIR grant for $225,000. There can be no assurances with respect to any such alternatives or that any additional outside funding to continue development of the Xcede Patch will be available to Xcede.
 
Strategy to Commercialize our Technologies
 
Our business strategy focuses on combining our expertise in funded research, product development and technology innovation to commercialize detection and analysis equipment for the homeland security, industrial and medical markets. We are executing on this strategy by:
 

· | developing and expanding our research portfolio; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | seeking to commercialize the technologies coming from our Innovation and Development segment; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | growing organically through investment in existing businesses; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identifying and investing in those technologies with the greatest revenue and growth potential in the market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For example, our CLYC dual mode nuclear detection crystal technology was developed by RMD under a program for the Department of Homeland Security for use in locating nuclear bombs or nuclear materials at our nation’s major cities, ports and borders. This technology has the potential to be very important to our national security, as well as other radiation detection applications, such as nuclear power plant safety. Our dual mode detection crystals have been commercialized in a detector currently being offered by a large manufacturer of detection equipment. RMD continues to further enhance this technology.
 
Our CLYC dual mode detection crystals technology is designed to be a single detector that replaces two detector subsystems – the gamma radiation detector and also the helium-3 detectors for neutrons. Increasing our value proposition is the fact that the stockpile of the chemical element helium-3, a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, is in short supply. The stockpile of helium-3 has been drawn down during the past 10 years, as the federal government has increased its use in neutron detectors to help prevent nuclear and radiological material from being smuggled into the U.S.
 
Intellectual Property (IP)
 
From October 2018 through September 2019, we have been granted four new U.S. patents and have filed 7 new patent applications. Our current portfolio, company-wide, is 79 issued and 39 pending applications, the largest percentage of which are issued to RMD. We believe that intellectual property represents an important strategic advantage for us.
Customers
 
We have more than 500 customers, with approximately 50% of our business concentrated in our top 10 customers. Our three largest customers are agencies and agents of the Federal government and accounted for approximately 14%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal year 2019. Our fourth and fifth largest customers are customers of our Optics segment and also accounted for approximately 5% and 3%, respectively, of our overall revenue during fiscal year 2019. The loss of any of these top five customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Generally, our customers provide purchase orders for a specific part and quantity or they provide a contract for research projects. Product orders are normally filled over a period ranging from one to six weeks. We also have blanket orders for product quantities that will potentially be required in upcoming periods. Contract research projects generally run for a one to two year period.

Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had a total of 218 employees, 207 of which are full-time. Of the total, 29 of our employees are engaged in administration, 12 are engaged in sales, 71 are engaged in research and/or engineering and 106 are engaged in manufacturing. The Company has a total of 26 Ph.D. level employees. Our operations are non-union except for a two-person union in one location.
Suppliers
 
Our largest supplier for materials and components is a supplier of the fused silica material that is fabricated and sold by our New Jersey facility. We believe that we have excellent relationships with our suppliers. If any of our suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might incur some delay in identifying such replacements.
Government Regulation
 
The businesses that we operate are subject to various federal and state regulations.
 
Our Innovation and Development segment (formerly Contract Research segment) is subject to the rules and regulations applicable to government contracting, including: the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts; the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bids and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. Government for payment or approval; and the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts.
 
The tissue sealant being developed by Xcede, our joint venture with Mayo Clinic, is subject to FDA regulations and approval in the United States and requires CE marking and other regulatory agency approval in other countries around the world.
 
Our use of radioactive materials in research and certain of our products (our dual-mode detector) subject us to laws regulating hazardous wastes under United States federal and certain state, environmental and atomic energy regulatory laws and similar laws in each jurisdiction in which our research and manufacturing facilities are located. Environmental compliance costs, which totaled approximately $54,000 for fiscal year 2019, have not historically had a material effect on our operating results.
 
With respect to our intellectual property rights, we rely on, and are subject to, the laws in the U.S. and abroad governing intellectual property protection.
