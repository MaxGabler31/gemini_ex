On October 20, 2010, Zhengzhou Zhonglian Hengfu Consulting Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign owned enterprise (“CU WFOE”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CU Hong Kong, was established in Henan province of the PRC. On January 16, 2011, our Company issued 20,000,000 shares of common stock to several non-U.S. persons for their investment of $300,000 in CU WFOE. The issuance was made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
Zhengzhou Anhou Insurance Agency Co., Ltd., the predecessor entity of Anhou, was founded in Henan province of the PRC on October 9, 2003. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in the insurance agency businesses in China, particularly those based on qualifications as well as capital requirements of the investors.

The registered capital increase of Anhou was in response to the promulgations of certain regulations by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CIRC”). On April 27, 2013, CIRC issued the Decision on Revising the Provisions of the Supervision and Administration of Specialized Insurance Agencies (the “Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions”), pursuant to which, CIRC mandated any insurance agency established subsequent to the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions to meet a minimum registered capital requirement of RMB50 million. On May 16, 2013, CIRC issued Notice for Further Clarification on Related Issues of Access to Professional Insurance Intermediary Market (the “2013 Notice”), pursuant to which, professional insurance agencies established prior to the issuance of the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions, with registered capital less than RMB50 million, can continue operation of their existing business within the provinces where they have the registered office or branch office, but shall not set up any new branches in any province where they do not have the registered office or any branch office. To better implement the expansion strategies of our Company, Anhou increased its registered capital to RMB50 million to meet the requirement of CIRC so that it is able set up new branches in any province beyond its current operations in the PRC.
 
On October 24, 2013, Anhou Original Shareholders transferred their interests in Anhou to Changrong Hu, a PRC citizen (“Mr. Hu,” together with Anhou New Investors, “Anhou Existing Shareholders”), for an aggregate consideration of RMB10 million. Mr. Hu is currently the legal representative, General Manager and the sole director of Anhou.
 
On November 17, 2016, Li Chen transferred his interests in Anhou to Chunyan Lu for an aggregate consideration of RMB3 million.
 
Sichuan Kangzhuang Insurance Agency Co., Ltd. (“Sichuan Kangzhuang”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anhou, was established with limited liability on September 4, 2006 in Sichuan province of the PRC. On September 6, 2010, shareholders of Sichuan Kangzhuang transferred their interest in Sichuan Kangzhuang to Anhou for an aggregate consideration of RMB532,622. For the purpose of procuring certain economic benefits and enabling a centralized control over the business operations in Sichuan province, the Company commenced the dissolution process of Sichuan Kangzhuang, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anhou and set up a branch office of Anhou in Sichuan province. Accordingly, Sichuan Kangzhuang had filed a dissolution application to the local Bureau of Administration and Commerce and made a public announcement published in local newspaper in October 2017. On June 22, 2017, the Sichuan Branch of Anhou obtained its business license to conduct insurance agency business. As of this date, Sichuan Kangzhuang is undergoing tax closure procedure, which involves multiple rounds of communication with the relevant tax authorities before obtaining the official approval for tax deregistration. Mr. Wen Yuan Hsu, the general manger of Sichuan Kangzhuang is the general manager of the Sichuan branch office of Anhou.
 
Jiangsu Law Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu Law”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anhou, was established with limited liability on September 19, 2005 in Jiangsu province of the PRC. Jiangsu Law is licensed to provide insurance brokerage services. On September 28, 2010, Anhou and the shareholders of Jiangsu Law entered into an equity transfer agreements. Pursuant to Provisions on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institution, effective on October 1, 2009, if an insurance brokerage entity fails to bring its registered capital to no less than RMB10,000,000 on or prior to October 1, 2012, the CIRC or its local counterpart, as applicable, may determine not to extend the insurance brokerage license. To meet such minimum registered capital requirement, on February 11, 2011, Anhou invested RMB4.82 million in Jiangsu Law to increase the registered capital to RMB10 million.
 
Our Consolidated Affiliated Entities
 
Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in insurance agency and brokerage businesses in China, especially those on qualifications as well as capital requirement of the investors, we operate our PRC business primarily through Anhou, Sichuan Kangzhuang and Jiangsu Law (collectively, the “Consolidated Affiliated Entities”, each a “Consolidated Affiliated Entity”). We do not hold equity interests in our Consolidated Affiliated Entities. However, through the VIE Agreements (defined as below), we effectively control, and are able to derive substantial economic benefits from, these Consolidated Affiliated Entities. On January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of China (“MOFCOM”) published a draft version of a proposed Foreign Investment Law (the “Draft Foreign Investment Law”) with an explanatory note. MOFCOM has requested comments from the public on the Draft Foreign Investment Law by February 17, 2015, which, once promulgated, will replace and integrate the three existing laws over foreign investment, however, how these changes will affect entities currently operating in China, particularly foreign controlled variable interest entities, is not entirely clear. See “Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure in the PRC”.
 
Our Consolidated Affiliated Entities in China are variable interest entities through which all of our insurance services in China are operated. These VIE Agreements that give us effective control over our Consolidated Affiliated Entities in China and allow us to consolidate the financial results of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities in our financial statements.
 
On January 17, 2011, CU WFOE, Anhou and Anhou Original Shareholders entered into a series of agreements (the “Old VIE Agreements”) pursuant to which CU WFOE exercises effective control over Anhou. As a result of the capital increase and the share transfer described above, on October 24, 2013, CU WFOE, Anhou and Anhou Existing Shareholders entered into a series of agreements (the “VIE Agreements”), including Power of Attorneys, Exclusive Option Agreements, Share Pledge Agreements, in the same form as the previous Old VIE Agreements, other than the change of shareholder names and their respective shareholdings. The Old VIE Agreements were terminated by and among CU WFOE, Anhou and Anhou Original Shareholders on the same date, except that the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement executed by and between CU WFOE and Anhou on January 17, 2011 remains in full effect. The VIE Agreements now in effect include:

As a holding company with no business other than holding equity interest of our operating subsidiary, CU WFOE in China and Law Broker in Taiwan, we rely principally on dividends to be paid by CU WFOE in China and Law Broker in Taiwan. CU WFOE, being the exclusive service provider to Anhou, relies on the service fees to which it is entitled from Anhou. Pursuant to the Exclusive Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) between CU WFOE and Anhou, CU WFOE has the right to collect 90% of the net profits of Anhou. Anhou has been paying service fees according to the Cooperation Agreement, but has not paid any dividend to CU WFOE to date. As of December 31, 2017, Anhou was operating at a profit, but since Anhou remains a growing company that requires financial resources to support further expansion, the dividend payment will be decided later on depending on the financial circumstances. Our capability to receive dividends from CU WFOE, convert them into USD and make the repatriation out of China is subject to the applicable PRC restrictions on the payment of dividends by PRC companies, laws and regulations on foreign exchange and restrictions on foreign investment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 88.45%, 10.71% and 0.84% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries, Consolidated Affiliated Entities and PFAL, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 87.52%, 12.10% and 0.38% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries, Consolidated Affiliated Entities and PFAL, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 85.31%, 14.37% and 0.32% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries, Consolidated Affiliated Entities and PFAL, respectively. Revenues in our consolidated financial statements are composed of commissions earned from insurance companies according to the terms of each insurance company service agreement, as well as revenues earned in association with the Strategic Alliance Agreement with AIATW.
 
Reclassification of Shares
 
On January 28, 2011, our Company increased the number of authorized shares from 30,000,000 shares of common stock to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. On July 2, 2012, our board of directors and stockholders approved, in connection with a reclassification of 1,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reclassified Shares”), par value $0.00001 per share held by Mr. Yi Hsiao Mao (“Mr. Mao”) into 1,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) on a share-for-share basis (the “Reclassification”), the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Mao and cancellation of 1,000,000 common stock held and submitted by Mr. Mao pursuant to the Reclassification. All of the 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are reclassified from the 1,000,000 common stock held by Mr. Mao and no additional consideration has been paid by Mr. Mao in connection with the Reclassification.

2017 Long Term Incentive Plan
 
On May 12, 2017, the Company’s 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) was approved by the shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of China United Insurance Service, Inc. Up to 10,000,000 shares of our Common Stock may be granted under the 2017 Plan (the “Share Pool”), provided that 2,000,000 shares of the Share Pool is reserved for issuance to eligible participants providing services to Action Holdings Financial Limited and its subsidiaries. Eligibility to participate is open to officers, directors and employees of, and other individuals (including sales agents who are exclusive agents of the Company or its subsidiaries or derive more than 50% of their income from those entities) who provide bona fide services to or for, us or any of our subsidiaries. Given that metrics for evaluating performance goals are rather complex and exhaustive, and that the Company’s management and Board of Directors are still working to develop a series of reward policies that specify various performance target levels and the size of the award or payout of performance shares with respect to each different target level attained, no awards were granted under the 2017 Plan as of December 31, 2017.
 
The following flow chart illustrates our Company’s organizational structure as of March 14, 2018:
 

Products and Services
 
Law Broker and Anhou market and sell to customers two broad categories of insurance products: life insurance products and property and casualty insurance products, both focused on meeting the particular insurance needs of individuals. The insurance products that Law Broker and Anhou sell are underwritten by some of the leading insurance companies in Taiwan and China, respectively.
 
Through Anhou’s wholly-owned insurance brokerage firm Jiangsu Law, it also closely interacts with insurance companies and actively locates and introduces the right customers in Anhou’s database matching the insurance products offered by such insurance companies to them.
 
Law Broker and Anhou are compensated primarily by commissions and fees paid by insurance companies, typically based on a percentage of the premium paid by the insured or a percentage of the amount recovered from insurance companies. Commission and fee rates generally depend on the type of insurance products, the particular insurance company.

In addition, the beneficiary designated in the annuity contract will receive guaranteed benefits upon the death of the insured during the coverage period. In return, the purchaser of the annuity products makes periodic payment of premiums during a pre-determined accumulation period.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Individual Health Insurance. The individual health insurance products Anhou distributes primarily consist of critical illness insurance products, which provide guaranteed benefits for specified critical illnesses during the coverage period. In return, the insured makes periodic payment of premiums over a pre-determined period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The life insurance products Anhou distributed in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 were primarily underwritten by, in alphabetical order, Aegon THTF Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AVIVA Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Funde Sino Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Huaxia Insurance Co., Ltd., and Taikang Life Insurance Company. None of these insurance company partners accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
In addition to the periodic premium payment schedules described above, most of the individual life insurance products we distribute also allow the insured to choose to make a single, lump-sum premium payment at the beginning of the policy term. If a periodic payment schedule is adopted by the insured, a life insurance policy can generate periodic payment of fixed premiums to the insurance company for a specified period of time. This means that once Anhou or Law Broker sells a life insurance policy with a periodic premium payment schedule, they will be able to derive commission and fee income from that policy for an extended period of time, sometimes up to 25 years. Because of this feature and the expected sustainable growth of life insurance sales in China and Taiwan, we have focused significant resources ever since the inception of Anhou and Law Broker on developing our capability to distribute individual life insurance products with periodic payment schedules. We expect that sales of life insurance products will continue to be our primary source of revenue in the next several years.

Strategic Alliance with AIATW
 
On June 10, 2013, AHFL entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Alliance Agreement”) with AIA International Limited Taiwan Branch (“AIATW”), the purpose of which is to promote life insurance products provided by AIATW within the in Taiwan by insurance agency companies or insurance brokerage companies affiliated with AHFL or CUIS. The original term of the Alliance Agreement was from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the Alliance Agreement, AIATW was required to pay AHFL an execution fee of $8,326,700 (NT$ 250,000,000) to be recorded as revenue upon fulfilling sales target over the next five years. As of September 23, 2013, AHFL had received $8,326,700 (NT$250,000,000) from AIATW under the Alliance Agreement. Pursuant to the Alliance Agreement, AHFL was entitled to the payment of the execution fee, subject to certain terms and conditions therein, including the satisfaction of the performance targets and the threshold 13-month persistency ratio. The execution fee may be required to be recalculated if certain performance targets are not met by AHFL.
 
On September 30, 2014, AHFL entered into an Amendment to Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “First Amendment to Alliance Agreement”) with AIATW. Pursuant to the First Amendment to Alliance Agreement, the expiration date of the Alliance Agreement was extended from May 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. In addition, both AHFL and AIATW agreed to adjust certain terms and conditions set forth in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, including the downward adjustment of the performance targets as well as the mechanism and formula calculating the execution fee to be refunded, if any.
 
On January 6, 2016, AHFL entered into an Amendment 2 to Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Second Amendment to Alliance Agreement”) with AIATW to further revise certain provisions in the Alliance Agreement and the previous amendment entered into by and between AHFL and AIATW.
 
Pursuant to the Second Amendment to Alliance Agreement, the expiration date of the Alliance Agreement was extended from May 31, 2018 to December 31, 2021, and the effect of the Alliance Agreement during the period from October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015 was suspended. In addition, both AHFL and AIATW agree to adjust certain terms and conditions set forth in the Alliance Agreement, among which: (i) expand the scope of services to be provided by AHFL to AIATW to include, without limitation, assessment and advice on suitability of cooperative partners, advice on product strategies suitable for promotion channel development, advice on promotion/sales channel improvement, advice on promotion channel marketing and strategic planning, and promotion channel talent training; and (ii) remove certain provisions related to performance milestones and refund of execution fees. On March 15, 2016, AHFL unilaterally issued a confirmation letter to AIATW (the “2016 Letter”), where it emphasized its commitment to achieve certain sales targets within a specific time frame and covenanted to refund a certain portion of execution fees calculated based on the formula therein upon failure to achieve such sales target, as applicable.

On June 14, 2017, AHFL entered into an Amendment 3 (the “Third Amendment”) to the Alliance Agreement with AIATW to further revise certain provisions in the Alliance Agreement and the previous amendments to the Alliance Agreement entered into by and between AHFL and AIATW.
 
Pursuant to the Third Amendment, except for the first contract year (April 15, 2013 to September 30, 2014), the sales targets for the remaining contract term under the Alliance Agreement shall be changed by reference to (i) the amount of the value of new business (“VONB”) and (ii) the 13-month persistency ratio as set forth therein, provided that to the extent any underlying insurance contract is revoked, invalid or terminated and premiums is refunded to such policyholder, the amount of the related VONB shall be correspondingly reduced. Both AHFL and AIATW agreed to calculate the business promotion fees (equivalent to the “execution fee” referred above) to be returned in case of failure to achieve the sales targets or the fees to be increased in case of exceeding the sales targets, as the case may be, based on two formulas specified in the Third Amendment. The primary factor under formula one focuses on the annual and/or accumulated achievement rate(s), while the primary factor under formula two focuses on the 13-month persistency ratio(s), subject to terms and conditions therein. The expanded scope of services to be provided by AHFL to AIATW as set forth in Section 4 of New Second Amendment is removed under the Third Amendment as well.
 
On June 14, 2017, with AIATW's consent, the 2016 Letter was revoked in order to conform to the latest terms and conditions regarding the cooperation between AHFL and AIATW as set forth in the Third Amendment.
 
Online Business
 
In recent years, the online insurance business has experienced rapid growth. Many insurance companies, portal websites and professional insurance intermediaries have begun launching its e-commerce platforms, providing real-time information to consumers and allowing consumers to directly complete transactions online. Law Broker began developing its online platform in 2016, and became the first brokerage company to receive formal approval from the Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan (“FSC”) to commence online business on May 9, 2016. The platform, SARAcares (website: https://www.saracares.com.tw), was launched on January 26, 2017. It offers a broad range of insurance products underwritten by multiple insurance companies, policy comparison features, and post-sale services that are backed by our online service staffs and nationwide sales network. As required by the relevant laws and regulations regarding e-commerce provided by the FSC, Law Broker obtained the ISO 27001 certification of Information Security Management System (ISMS) and BS 10012 certification of Personal Information Management System on June 20, 2017. Our online business in Taiwan is still at a nascent stage with the majority of the sales still being completed by off-line agents.
Unified Operating Platform
 
Law Broker has self-constructed a Unified Operating Platform, an information technology infrastructure that serves to enhance operational, sales processes, and administrative efficiency. Since Law Broker’s establishment in 1992, it has successfully implemented the following components of its operating platform across its branch offices in Taiwan through a hub center located in Taipei:

· | A centralized client and insurance policy management and analysis system, which encompasses our life insurance unit and property and casualty insurance unit, that will better support business operations and facilitate risk control;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A centralized client relations management system, that manages and analyzes client interactions to drive sales growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An integrated administrative and information system, that increases the management efficiency among the subsidiaries, branches and sales departments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A centralized and computerized accounting and financial management system, that improves the efficiency of commission distribution and enforcement;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A human resources management and performance tracking system; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An e-training system to provide online trainings to sales professionals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Unified Operating Platform has proved to be an efficient and streamlined operating system which has contribute to the successful expansion and growth of Law Broker into one of the leading insurance brokerage companies in Taiwan, with 30 sales and service outlets (including the headquarters) across Taiwan and 2,609 employees and insurance sales professionals as of December 31, 2017.

In accordance with our growth strategy in China, Anhou has made significant effort to adapt the Unified Operating Platform utilized by Law Broker to better meet the operational need in China. Since September 2010, Anhou has successfully implemented the tailored operating platform across the PRC subsidiaries through a hub center located in Nantong, Jiangsu province. We expect that this tailored operating platform will make selling easier for sales agents in China, facilitate standardized business and financial management, enhance risk control and increase operational efficiency for the PRC subsidiaries.
 
Anhou has tailored and refined the platform on the basis of Law Broker’s well-developed operating platform in Taiwan and believes that it is difficult for our competitors in China, particularly new market entrants, to reproduce a similar platform without substantial financial resources, time and operating experience.
 
Because the various systems, policies and procedures under both of operating platforms utilized by Law Broker and Anhou can be rolled out quickly as we enter new regions or make acquisitions, we believe we can expand our distribution network rapidly and efficiently while maintaining the quality of our services.
 
Distribution and Service Network and Marketing
 
Since Law Broker’s establishment in 1992, it has devoted substantial resources to building up its distribution and service network. Law Broker currently has 30 sales and service outlets spread across Taiwan (including the headquarters), among which, 10 are located in the northern region, 13 are located in the central region, 5 are located in the southern region and 2 are located in the eastern region. As of December 31, 2017, Law Broker had 2,414 sales professionals and 195 administrative staff members.
 
The following table sets forth some additional information of Law Broker’s distribution and service network by region as of December 31, 2017:
 

Region | Number of Sales and Service Outlets | | Number of Sales Professionals 
--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+----+-------------------------------
Northern region (including the headquarter) | | 10 | | 703 
Southern region | | 5 | | 507 
Central region | | 13 | | 1,162
Eastern region | | 2 | | 42 
Total | | 30 | | 2414 

 
Law Broker markets and sells life insurance products, property and casualty insurance products directly to the targeted customers through the sales professionals, who are independent contractors, not its employees.
 
Since Anhou’s establishment in 2003, it has devoted substantial resources in building up its distribution and service network. Anhou has targeted its distribution and service network in provinces with most population in China, such as Henan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan. As of December 31, 2017, Anhou had two insurance agencies and one insurance brokerage firm, with 2,715 sales professionals and 116 administrative staff members operating across 43 cities within these six provinces.
 
The following table sets forth some additional information of Anhou’s distribution and service network by province as of December 31, 2017:
 

Province | Number of Sales and Service Outlets | | Number of Sales Agents
----------+--------------------------------------+----+-----------------------
Henan | | 30 | | 1,536
Sichuan | | 7 | | 572 
Jiangsu | | 3 | | 392 
Fujian | | 1 | | 203 
Guangdong | | 1 | | 12 
Yunnan | | 1 | | - 
Total | | 43 | | 2,715

 
Anhou markets and sells life insurance products, property and casualty insurance products directly to the targeted customers through the sales agents, who are independent contractors, not its employees.
 
Customers
 
As of December 31, 2017, Law Broker had approximately 545,292 customers, among which approximately 81.6% purchased life insurance products and approximately 18.4% purchased property and casualty insurance products from Law Broker.
 
Due to its extensive line of insurance products underwritten by the insurance companies in Taiwan, Law Broker managed to offer a variety of insurance products to customers of different ages or professions. However, as an aging population in Taiwan has gradually become a more recognized social issue, despite relatively healthy government-sponsored retirement and medical programs, more and more Taiwanese, especially those with stable financial means and aiming for high-end retirement and medical treatment, have been focusing on endowment and medical type of commercial insurance products, while the investment type of insurance products have been playing a less significant role since the economic downturn.

In addition, from time to time, Law Broker has been, either voluntarily or upon request of insurance companies, advising insurance companies or providing feedback on particular types of insurance products before they are put on the market. This interaction with insurance companies has not only enhanced the close cooperation between Law Broker and the insurance companies, but also gives it an edge in understanding the in-depth features of such insurance products for marketing and distribution purposes.
 
Law Broker sells automobile insurance and casualty insurance primarily to individual customers. Law Broker sells liability insurance to institutional customers.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Anhou had 47,257 customers, among which 99% purchased life insurance products and 1% purchased property and casualty insurance products from Anhou.
 
Anhou sells automobile insurance and individual accident insurance primarily to individual customers. Anhou sells commercial property insurance to institutional customers.
 
The revenues of Anhou are primarily generated from the sale of life insurance products and we expect the continuous growth in this regard, as more and more customers in China realized the insufficiency of the mandatory social insurance coverage and the necessity to supplement it with commercial insurance.
 
Insurance Company Partners
 
We are selective in terms of choosing insurance companies as our partners. We take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the reputation and integrity of the insurance company, the quality and competitiveness of insurance products offered, the prudence and health of the financial standing of the insurance company as well as the complexity and efficiency of claim adjustment and settlement. During years of operation, both Law Broker and Anhou have formed strategic relationships with numerous insurance companies in Taiwan and China, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, Law Broker had established business relationships with 23 insurance companies in Taiwan and Anhou had established business relationships with 34 insurance companies in China.
 
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Law Broker’s major insurance company partners, after aggregating the business conducted between Law Broker and the various local branches of the insurance companies were AIATW, Farglory Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Fubon Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Taiwan Life Insurance Co., Ltd., and TransGlobe Life Insurance Inc., arranged in alphabetical order. Among them, Farglory Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Taiwan Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and TransGlobe Life Insurance Inc., accounted for approximately 25.41%, 12.45% and 11.18% of the Company’s total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
 
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Anhou’s major insurance company partners, after aggregating the business conducted between Anhou and the various local branches of the insurance companies were Aegon THTF Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AVIVA Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Funde Sino Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Huaxia Insurance Co., Ltd., and Taikang Life Insurance Co., Ltd., arranged in alphabetical order. None of these insurance company partners accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Competition
 
A number of industry players are involved in the distribution of insurance products in Taiwan and PRC. We compete for customers on the basis of product offerings, customer services and reputation. Because we primarily distribute individual insurance products, our principal competitors include:

· | Professional insurance intermediaries. Life insurance is our core business and has a strong regional feature. Through years of business development, we believe that we can compete effectively with other insurance intermediary companies as we have a longer operational history and over the years have assembled a strong and stable team of managers and sales professionals. With the implementation of our unified operating platform, we believe that we could strengthen our lead in our developed local regions and expand our operation to our newly selected areas. However, with increasing consolidation expected in the insurance intermediary sector in the coming years, we expect competition within this sector to intensify.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insurance companies. The distribution of individual life insurance products in Taiwan and China historically has been dominated by insurance companies, which usually use both in-house sales force and exclusive sales agents to distribute their own products. We believe that we can compete effectively with insurance companies because we focus only on distribution and offer our customers a broad range of insurance products underwritten by multiple insurance companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other business entities. In recent years, business entities that distribute insurance products as an ancillary business, primarily commercial banks and postal offices have been playing an increasingly important role in the distribution of insurance products, especially life insurance products. However, the insurance products distributed by these entities are usually confined to those related to their main lines of business, such as investment-related life insurance products. We believe that we can compete effectively with these business entities because we offer our customers a broader variety of products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the past 14 years, Anhou has expanded its business across 43 cities within Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan provinces with 2,715 sales professionals and 116 administrative staff members. Based on the insurance products Anhou is offering and the geographic areas of its branch offices, Anhou’s primary competitors are small-sized and middle-sized insurance agency companies. Anhou is relatively larger in terms of the number of salesmen as well as the sales revenue comparing to those competing insurance agency companies. On April 20, 2012, Anhou obtained the nationwide license from CIRC, pursuant to which Anhou may set up its branch office across the PRC to carry out the insurance agency business with no further approval requirement from CIRC other than filing with the local CIRC at the provincial level.
 
On March 26, 2012, CIRC issued the Notice on Suspension of Market Entry Approval of Regional Insurance Agencies and Certain Part-time Insurance Agencies (“2012 Notice”). Pursuant to the 2012 Notice, CIRC and its local counterparts will suspend granting any new license to full-time insurance agencies operating on a regional basis (“Regional Insurance Agencies”) as well as to branch offices of existing Regional Insurance Agencies. In addition, no new license for part-time insurance agency businesses will be granted unless such applicant is a financial institution or a China Post office. However, CIRC emphasized in the 2012 Notice that its local counterparts shall continue to support the establishment of insurance intermediary groups and full-time insurance agencies operating on a nationwide basis, as well as continue to support their respective branch offices.
 
As indicated in the 2012 Notice, it appears that CIRC is aiming to increase the entry thresholds of Regional Insurance Agencies and part-time insurance agencies with a view to reducing the number, as well as, enhancing the quality of insurance agencies in the market. CIRC has also indicated in the 2012 Notice that it intends to further amend related rules and regulations to improve the market entry and exit mechanism for insurance agencies, and promote the professionalism as well as enhance the quality of insurance agencies in the market.
 
On April 27, 2013, CIRC issued the Decision on Revising the Provisions of the Supervision and Administration of Specialized Insurance Agencies (the “Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions”), pursuant to which, CIRC has mandated any insurance agency established subsequent to the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions to meet a minimum registered capital requirement of RMB50 million.

--

 

On May 16, 2013, CIRC issued the 2013 Notice, pursuant to which, professional insurance agencies established prior to the issuance of the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions, with registered capital less than RMB50 million, can continuously operate their existing business within the provinces where they have the registered office or branch office, but shall not set up any new branches in any province where they do not have the registered office or any branch office.
 
With the promulgation and implementation of the above-mentioned regulations, we expect a better regulated insurance agency market in China with orderly competition and pursuit for professional excellence, which will accentuate our competitive advantage due to our continuous commitment to quality service. On October 24, 2013, Anhou increased its registered capital to RMB50 million. We believe that we will be in a better position to obtain the full support expressly provided in the 2013 Notice from the local CIRC on our expansion strategy nationwide.

Content Related to Insurance Industry in the Legal Documents of China’s Accession to the WTO
 
According to the Circular of the CIRC on Distributing the Content Related to Insurance Industry in the Legal Documents of China’s Accession to the WTO, for the life insurance sector, within three years of China’s accession to the WTO on December 11, 2001, geographical restrictions were to be lifted, equity joint venture companies allowed to provide health insurance, group insurance, and pension/annuity services to Chinese citizens and foreign citizens, and no other restrictions allowed except those on the proportion of foreign investment (no more than 50%) and establishment conditions. For the non-life insurance sector, within three years of China’s accession, the geographical restrictions were to be lifted and no restrictions allowed other than establishment conditions. For the insurance brokerage sector, within five years of China’s accession, the establishment of wholly foreign-funded subsidiary companies was to be allowed, and no restrictions allowed other than establishment conditions and restrictions on business scope.

However, as these regulations are still relatively new, local CIRC counterparts may have different interpretations. Based on the consultation by the Company with the relevant local counterparts of CIRC, they are of the view that the proportion of foreign investment in insurance intermediaries shall not exceed 24.9%.

PRC Regulations on Tax
 
PRC Enterprise Income Tax
 
The PRC EIT is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the PRC accounting standards and regulations, as well as the EIT law. On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of China enacted the EIT Law, a new EIT law which became effective on January 1, 2008. On December 6, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Rules which also became effective on January 1, 2008. On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued the Notice on Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Transition Preferential Policy under the EIT Law, or the Transition Preferential Policy Circular, which became effective simultaneously with the EIT Law. The EIT Law imposes a uniform EIT rate of 25% on all domestic enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises unless they qualify under certain exceptions. Under the EIT Law, as further clarified by the Implementation Rules, the Transition Preferential Policy Circular and other related regulations, enterprises that were established and already enjoyed preferential tax treatments before March 16, 2007 will continue to enjoy them in the following manners: (i) in the case of preferential tax rates, for a five-year period starting from January 1, 2008, during which the tax rate will gradually increase to 25%; or (ii) in the case of preferential tax exemption or reduction for a specified term, until the expiration of such term. However, if such an enterprise has not enjoyed the preferential treatments yet because of its failure to make a profit, its term for preferential treatment will be deemed to start from 2008.
