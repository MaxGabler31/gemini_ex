ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Where we say "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "Bancorp" or "Flagstar," we usually mean Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. However, in some cases, a reference will include our wholly-owned subsidiary Flagstar Bank, FSB (the "Bank"). See the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms on page 3 for definitions used throughout this Form 10-K.    
Introduction
We are a savings and loan holding company founded in 1993. Our business is primarily conducted through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, a federally chartered savings bank founded in 1987. We provide commercial and consumer banking services and we are the 5th largest bank mortgage originator in the nation and the 6th largest sub-servicer of mortgage loans nationwide. At December 31, 2018, we had 3,938 full-time equivalent employees. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "FBC." 
Our relationship-based business model leverages our full-service bank’s capabilities and our national mortgage platform to create and build financial solutions for our customers. At December 31, 2018, we operated 160 full service banking branches that offer a full set of banking products to consumer, commercial, and government customers. Our banking footprint spans throughout Michigan, Indiana, California, Wisconsin, Ohio and contiguous states. 
We originate mortgages through a wholesale network of brokers and correspondents in all 50 states, and our own loan officers from 75 retail locations in 24 states and two call centers, which include our direct-to-consumer lending team. Flagstar is also a leading national servicer of mortgage loans and provides complementary ancillary offerings including MSR lending, servicing advance lending and recapture services.
Recent Acquisitions
In the first quarter of 2018, we closed on the purchase of the mortgage loan warehouse business from Santander Bank, which added $499 million in outstanding warehouse loans, and we completed the acquisition of eight Desert Community Bank branches in San Bernardino County, California, with $614 million in deposits and $59 million in loans. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we closed on the purchase of 52 branches in Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, from Wells Fargo, with $1.8 billion in deposits and $107 million in loans. For further information, see Note 2 - Acquisitions. 
Operating Segments
Our operations are conducted through our three operating segments: Community Banking, Mortgage Originations and Mortgage Servicing. For further information, see MD&A - Operating Segments and Note 23 - Segment Information.
Competition
We face substantial competition in attracting deposits and generating loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other savings banks, commercial banks and credit unions in our banking footprint. Money market funds, full-service securities brokerage firms, and financial technology companies also compete with us for these funds. We compete for deposits by offering a broad range of high quality customized banking services at competitive rates. From a lending perspective, there are many institutions including commercial banks, national mortgage lenders, local savings banks, credit unions, and commercial lenders offering consumer and commercial loans. We compete by offering competitive interest rates, fees, and other loan terms through efficient and customized service.
Subsidiaries
We conduct business primarily through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary. In addition, the Bank has wholly-owned subsidiaries through which we conduct non-bank business or which are inactive. The Bank and its wholly owned subsidiaries comprised 99.7 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2018. For further information, see Note 1 - Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Standards, Note 8 - Variable Interest Entities and Note 24 - Holding Company Only Financial Statements.

Regulation and Supervision
The Bank is a federally chartered savings bank, subject to federal regulation and oversight by the OCC. We are also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the extent permitted by law and the requirements established by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also subject to the supervision of the CFPB which regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. The OCC, FDIC and the CFPB may take regulatory enforcement actions if we do not operate in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be instituted against us, or any "institution-affiliated party," such as a director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person, who engages in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The FDIC has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, if after notice and hearing, we are found to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which to operate and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund rather than our shareholders. 

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve. We are required to file certain reports and we are subject to examination by the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve. Under the federal securities laws, we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Any change to laws and regulations, whether by the FDIC, OCC, CFPB, SEC, the Federal Reserve, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
Holding Company Regulation
Acquisition, Activities and Change in Control. Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company. We may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, activities permissible for a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act and relevant regulations. Further, we generally are required to obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company (or savings associations or savings and loan holding company) if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company (or savings association or savings and loan holding company). Additionally, we are prohibited from acquiring control of a depository institution that is not federally insured or retaining control of a savings association subsidiary for more than one year after the date that such subsidiary becomes uninsured. 

We may not be acquired by a company, unless the Federal Reserve approves such transaction. In addition, the GLBA generally restricts a company from acquiring us if that company is engaged directly or indirectly in activities that are not permissible for a savings and loan holding company or financial holding company.
Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banking entities, including federal savings associations and their and affiliates, from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and/or sponsoring certain "covered funds," In 2013, the agencies adopted rules to implement section 619. These rules, collectively with section 619, are commonly referred to as the "Volcker Rule." Compliance with the Volcker Rule generally has been required since July 21, 2015. Pursuant to the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we have established a standard compliance program based on the size and complexity of our operations.

Capital Requirements. The Bank and Flagstar are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the OCC and Federal Reserve. The OCC and Federal Reserve have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization’s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements. 
The Bank and Flagstar have been subject to the capital requirements of the Basel III rules since January 1, 2015. On October 27, 2017, the agencies published a proposed rule which would simplify certain aspects of the capital rules, including the capital treatment for items covered by the rule. The agencies expect that the capital treatment and transition provisions for items covered by Basel III rules will change once the proposal is finalized and effective. On November 21, 2017, in preparation for forthcoming rules that would simplify regulatory capital requirements to reduce regulatory burden, federal banking regulators approved the extension of the existing transitional capital treatment for certain regulatory capital deductions and risk weights. For additional information, see Note 20 - Regulatory Capital.

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s "source of strength" doctrine and extended it to savings and loan holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the prudential regulatory agencies are required to promulgate joint rules requiring savings and loan holding companies, such as us, to serve as a source of financial strength for any depository institution subsidiary by maintaining the ability to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event that it suffers financial distress.
Collins Amendment. The Collins Amendment to the Dodd Frank Act established minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and non-bank financial companies that are supervised by the Federal Reserve. The minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements are determined by the minimum ratios established by the federal banking agencies that apply to insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations. The amendment states that certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, may be included in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies that had total assets below $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. As we were below $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, the trust preferred securities classified as long term debt on our balance sheet are included as Tier 1 capital while they are outstanding, unless we complete an acquisition of a depository institution holding company and we report total assets greater than $15 billion at the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurs. At our present size, with total assets of $18.5 billion at December 31, 2018, an acquisition of a depository holding company would likely cause our trust preferred securities totaling $247 million at December 31, 2018 to no longer be included in Tier 1 capital and would therefore be included in Tier 2 capital.
Banking Regulation
We must comply with a wide variety of banking, consumer protection and securities laws, regulations and supervisory expectations and are regulated by multiple regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
FDIC Insurance and Assessment. The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government through the DIF. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing each financial institution an insurance premium. The FDIC defined deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution is equal to the average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average tangible equity. 
All FDIC-insured financial institutions must pay an annual assessment based on asset size to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO bonds"), a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The last of the remaining FICO bonds will mature in September 2019. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) projects that the last FICO assessment will be collected in the first half of 2019.
In 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule in accordance with the provisions of Dodd-Frank that requires large institutions to bear the burden, through an imposed surcharge, of raising the DIF reserve ratio. As of September 30, 2018, the DIF has exceeded the required ratio and therefore the surcharge imposed on large banks ended as of that date. We expect the elimination of the surcharge to decrease FDIC insurance premiums approximately $3 million for the full year 2019. 
Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. The Bank is subject to the affiliate and insider transaction rules applicable to member banks of the Federal Reserve as well as additional limitations imposed by the OCC. These provisions prohibit or limit the Bank from extending credit to, or entering into certain transactions with principal stockholders, directors and executive officers of the banking institution and certain of its affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed further restrictions on transactions with certain affiliates and extension of credit to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders.
Limitation on Capital Distributions. The OCC and FRB regulate all capital distributions made by the Bank, directly or indirectly, to the holding company, including dividend payments. The Bank must receive approval from the OCC and FRB to pay dividends to the Bancorp if, after paying those dividends, the Bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements. Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the OCC if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
Loans to One Borrower. Under the Home Owners Loan Act (HOLA), loans to one borrower may not be in excess of 15 percent of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital plus any portion of the allowance for loan losses not included in Tier 2 capital. This limit was $256 million as of December 31, 2018. For further information, see MD&A - Risk Management.

Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering. The Bank is subject to the BSA and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. The BSA requires all financial institutions to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes various record keeping and reporting requirements such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence requirements. The Bank is also required to comply with U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, individuals, entities and others.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 
On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“Economic Growth Act”) was enacted, which repealed or modified several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Certain key aspects of the Economic Growth Act that have the potential to affect the Company’s business and results of operations include:

• | Raising the total asset threshold from $10 billion to $250 billion at which bank holding companies are required to conduct annual company-run stress tests mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.


• | Revising the definition of high volatility commercial real estate loans to ease the regulatory burden associated with the identification of loans that meet qualifying criteria.


• | Providing that certain reciprocal deposits shall not be considered brokered deposits, subject to certain limitations.


• | Entitling federal savings associations, such as the Bank, with less than $20 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2017, an option to elect to operate as covered savings associations (similar to a national bank) without changing their charter.

Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
The Bank is subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws and regulations. These include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, or sale of consumer financial products or services, and the GLBA regarding customer privacy and data security. 
The Bank is subject to supervision by the CFPB, which has responsibility for enforcing federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers, including prohibitions against unfair, deceptive abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service including regulations related to the origination and servicing of residential mortgages. The Bank is subject to the CFPB’s supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. As a result, we could incur increased costs, potential litigation or be materially limited or restricted in our business, product offerings or services in the future. 
Due to regulatory focus on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers, including mortgage and consumer lending, may pose particular challenges. Further, the CFPB continues to propose new rules and to amend existing rules. While we are not aware of any material compliance issues related to our mortgage and consumer lending practices, the focus of regulators and the changes to regulations may increase our compliance risks. Despite the supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, failure to comply with these regulations could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers or other imposed penalties.
Additionally, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit financial institutions from engaging in discriminatory lending practices. The Department of Justice, CFPB, and other agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Bank's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Bank's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions or penalties or limit certain revenue channels.

Incentive Compensation
The U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of U.S. banks do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of U.S. banks that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These reviews are tailored to each bank based on the scope and complexity of the bank’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements.
