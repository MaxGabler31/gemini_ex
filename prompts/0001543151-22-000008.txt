ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.
Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).
Our Segments
As of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.
Mobility
Mobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.
We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.
Delivery
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.
During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc. (“Drizly”), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly’s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The acquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Freight
We believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles, 
which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.
We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.
During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight business through Transplace’s expertise in transportation management. The acquisition of Transplace has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Platform Synergies
Our Platform
The foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.

Massive Network | Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.
Leading Technology | We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones. 
Operational Excellence | Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators. 
Product Expertise | Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust. 

We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.
We believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on average, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.
With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our “Super App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. 
We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.
Competitive Environment
We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize 
these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:
•Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.
•Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.
•Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.
Government Regulation
We operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below.
Mobility
Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.
In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. 
Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.
In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For example:
•In London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,” including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.
•Since April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.
•In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product. 
•In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.
See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.
As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.
Data Privacy and Protection
Our technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.
Payments and Financial Services
Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.
Antitrust
Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as 
the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.
To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.
Research and Development
Because the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.
Seasonality
Mobility
We typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America and Europe. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. We expect that seasonality will eventually return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.
Delivery
We typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.
Human Capital at Uber
Employees
We are a global company and as of December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 29,300 employees globally and operations in approximately 72 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.
Adapting to a New Way of Working. In 2021, the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our employees and our workforce management strategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work. As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans—although many of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among caregivers of young children. To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigated this crisis in their personal and professional lives. We provided 
more attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.
Employee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was created based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.
Employee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promote wellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life’s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers competitive benefits packages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations. 
For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our 2021 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website. The information in the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that great minds don’t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued. We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership roles come from historically underrepresented groups.
Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation packages of our most senior executives.
We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or the Integrity Helpline.
As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company. In July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward. Some of our commitments to anti-racism include:
•Ridding our platform of racism
•Fighting racism with technology
•Sustaining equity and belonging for all
•Driving equity in the community
For more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which are available on our website. The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K. 
Driver and Courier Well-Being
In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.
In relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible work in approximately 72 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created 
through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.
Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.
•Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:
◦In the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent work, calling on policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work—one where having access to protections and benefits doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.
◦In California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to provide benefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.
◦In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.
•Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, including implementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22. 
•Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).
•Progression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over 4,000 Drivers and their family members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.
•Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on our app, our support services, and other matters. 
For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well our 2021 ESG Report and our 2021 People and Culture Report. The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.
