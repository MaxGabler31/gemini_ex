 Item 1.  Business. 
 General Description
 Quaker develops, produces, and markets a broad range of formulated chemical specialty products and offers chemical management services (“CMS”) for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications in a global portfolio throughout its four regions: the North America region, the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region, the Asia/Pacific region and the South America region. The principal products and services in Quaker’s global portfolio include: (i) rolling lubricants (used by manufacturers of steel in the hot and cold rolling of steel and by manufacturers of aluminum in the hot rolling of aluminum); (ii) machining and grinding compounds (used by metalworking customers in cutting, shaping, and grinding metal parts which require special treatment to enable them to tolerate the manufacturing process, achieve closer tolerance, and improve tool life); (iii) hydraulic fluids (used by steel, metalworking, and other customers to operate hydraulic equipment); (iv) corrosion preventives (used by steel and metalworking customers to protect metal during manufacture, storage, and shipment); (v) specialty greases (used in automotive and aerospace production processes and applications, the manufacturing of steel, and various other applications); (vi) metal finishing compounds (used to prepare metal surfaces for special treatments such as galvanizing and tin plating and to prepare metal for further processing); (vii) forming compounds (used to facilitate the drawing and extrusion of metal products); (viii) chemical milling maskants for the aerospace industry; (ix) temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products; (x) construction products, such as flexible sealants and protective coatings, for various applications; (xi) bio-lubricants (that are mainly used in machinery in the forestry and construction industries); (xii) die casting lubricants; and (xiii) programs to provide CMS.  The following are the respective contributions to consolidated net sales of each individual product line representing 10% or more of consolidated net sales for any of the past three years:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
-----------------------------------+------+---+------+------+-----

Acquisition Activity
 On April 4, 2017, Quaker entered into a share purchase agreement with Gulf Houghton Lubricants, Ltd. (“Gulf”) to purchase the entire issued and outstanding share capital of Houghton International, Inc. (“Houghton”) (herein referred to as “the Combination”).  The shares will be bought for aggregate purchase consideration consisting of: (i) $172.5 million in cash; (ii) a number of shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company comprising 24.5% of the common stock outstanding upon the closing of the Combination; and (iii) the Company’s assumption of Houghton’s net indebtedness as of the closing of the Combination, which was approximately $690 million at signing.  At closing, the total aggregate purchase consideration is dependent on the Company’s stock price and the level of Houghton’s indebtedness.  
 The Company secured $1.15 billion in commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank to fund the Combination and to provide additional liquidity, and has since replaced these commitments with a syndicated bank agreement (“the New Credit Facility”) with a group of lenders for $1.15 billion.  The New Credit Facility is contingent upon and will not be effective until the closing of the Combination.  The New Credit Facility includes a $400.0 million multicurrency revolver, a $575.0 million USD term loan and a $175.0 million EUR equivalent term loan, each with a five-year term from the date the New Credit Facility becomes effective.  The maximum amount available under the New Credit Facility can be increased by $200.0 million at the Company’s option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions.  Borrowings under the New Credit Facility will bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR rate plus a margin.  The Company currently estimates the annual floating rate cost will be in the 3.50% to 3.75% range based on current market interest rates.  The New Credit Facility will be subject to certain financial and other covenants, including covenants that the Company’s consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 4.25 to 1 and the Company’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA to interest expense ratio cannot be less than 3.0 to 1.  Both the USD and EUR equivalent term loans will have quarterly principal amortization during their respective five-year terms, with 5% amortization of the principal balance due in years 1 and 2, 7.5% in year 3, and 10% in years 4 and 5, with the remaining principal amounts due at maturity.  Until closing, the Company incurs certain interest costs paid to maintain the banks’ committed capital.  These interest costs began to accrue on September 29, 2017 and bear an interest rate of 0.30% per annum. 
 In addition, the issuance of the Company’s shares at closing of the Combination was subject to approval by Quaker’s shareholders under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and approval was received at a meeting of the Company’s shareholders during the third quarter of 2017.  Also, the Combination is subject to regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, China and Australia.  The Company received regulatory approval from China in July 2017 and from Australia in October 2017.  Depending on the remaining regulatory approvals and other customary terms and conditions set forth in the share purchase agreement, the Company currently estimates closing of the Combination will occur during the first half of 2018.

In December 2017, the Company expanded its business through the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in its India affiliate, Quaker Chemical India Private Limited (“QCIL”) for approximately $31.8 million.  QCIL sells products to the steel and metalworking industries in India and has associates based in various locations around India.  The Company had been a joint venture partner in QCIL for 20 years.  India is a market with strong growth opportunities in most of the Company’s business lines and this acquisition, along with a new plant in Dahej to be completed in 2018, further strengthens the Company’s position in India while also simplifying the overall corporate structure and improving organizational efficiencies.  In addition, the Company acquired assets associated with a business that markets, sells and manufacturers certain metalworking fluids in North America in May 2017 for approximately $5.4 million.  
 Sales Revenue
 A substantial portion of Quaker’s sales worldwide are made directly through its own employees and its CMS programs with the balance being handled through distributors and agents.  Quaker employees visit the plants of customers regularly, some work on site, and through training and experience identify production issues which can be resolved or alleviated either by adapting Quaker’s existing products or by applying new formulations developed in Quaker’s laboratories.  Quaker’s new business development relies less on the use of advertising, and more heavily upon its reputation in the markets which it serves.  Generally, separate manufacturing facilities of a single customer are served by different personnel. 
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the terms of its underlying customer agreements, when title and risk of loss have been transferred, when collectability is reasonably assured, and when pricing is fixed or determinable.  This generally occurs for product sales when products are shipped or delivered to customers; for consignment-type arrangements, upon usage by the customer; and for services, when they are performed.  Related to other income generation, Quaker receives license fees and royalties and includes them in other income when the amounts are recognized in accordance with their agreed-upon terms, when performance obligations are satisfied, when the amount is fixed or determinable, and when collectability is reasonably assured.  
 As part of the Company’s CMS, certain third-party product sales to customers are managed by the Company.  Where the Company acts as principal, revenues are recognized on a gross reporting basis at the selling price negotiated with its customers.  Where the Company acts as an agent, such revenue is recorded using the net reporting method as service revenues at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the Company for ordering the goods.  Third-party products transferred under arrangements resulting in net reporting revenue totaled $44.5 million, $43.5 million and $48.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Competition
 The chemical specialty industry comprises a number of companies of similar size as well as companies larger and smaller than Quaker.  Quaker cannot readily determine its precise position in every industry it serves.  Based on information available to Quaker, however, the Company estimates it holds a leading global position in the market for process fluids to produce sheet steel.  The Company also believes it holds significant global positions in the markets for process fluids in portions of the automotive and industrial markets.  The offerings of many of our competitors differ from those of Quaker; some offer a broad portfolio of fluids, including general lubricants, while others have more specialized product ranges.  All competitors provide different levels of technical services to individual customers.  Competition in the industry is based primarily on the ability to provide products that meet the needs of the customer and render technical services and laboratory assistance to the customer, and to a lesser extent on price.
Major Customers and Markets
 In 2017, Quaker’s five largest customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions with semi-autonomous purchasing authority) accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales, with its largest customer accounting for approximately 8% of consolidated net sales.  A significant portion of Quaker’s revenues are realized from the sale of process fluids and services to manufacturers of steel, automobiles, aircraft, appliances, and durable goods, and, therefore, Quaker is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by these manufacturers and their customers.  Quaker’s financial performance is generally correlated to the volume of global production within the industries it serves, rather than discretely related to the financial performance of such industries.  Furthermore, steel customers typically have limited manufacturing locations compared to metalworking customers and generally use higher volumes of products at a single location.
Raw Materials
 Quaker uses over 1,000 raw materials including mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, vegetable oils and derivatives, ethylene derivatives, solvents, surface active agents, various smaller quantities of chemicals compounds that act as additives to our base formulations (“additives”) and a wide variety of other organic and inorganic compounds.  During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, three of our larger raw material groups (mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, and vegetable oils and derivatives) in the aggregate accounted for approximately one third of the total cost of Quaker’s raw material purchases during each period, with each being roughly proportional to the total aggregate spend.  The price of mineral oil and its derivatives can be affected by the price of crude oil and industry refining capacity.  Animal fat and vegetable oil prices are impacted by biodiesel consumption which is also affected by the price of crude oil.  In addition, other significant raw material purchases including ethylene derivatives, solvents, surface active agents and additives are also indirectly impacted by trends in mineral oil and derivatives and, therefore, crude oil trends.  Accordingly, significant fluctuations in the price of crude oil could have a material impact 
  3

  
on the cost of these raw materials.  In addition, many of the raw materials used by Quaker are commodity chemicals which can experience significant price volatility.  Accordingly, Quaker’s earnings could be affected by market changes in raw material prices.  Reference is made to the disclosure contained in Item 7A of this Report.
 Patents and Trademarks
 Quaker has a limited number of patents and patent applications, including patents issued, applied for, or acquired in the United States and in various foreign countries, some of which may prove to be material to its business.  Principal reliance is placed upon Quaker’s proprietary formulae and the application of its skills and experience to meet customer needs.  Quaker’s products are identified by trademarks that are registered throughout its marketed area.
 Research and Development—Laboratories
 Quaker’s research and development laboratories are directed primarily toward applied research and development since the nature of Quaker’s business requires continual modification and improvement of formulations to provide chemical specialties to satisfy customer requirements.  Quaker maintains quality control laboratory facilities in each of its manufacturing locations.  In addition, Quaker maintains laboratory facilities in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Santa Fe Springs, California; Batavia, New York; Aurora, Illinois; Dayton, Ohio; Uithoorn, The Netherlands; Navarra, Spain; Barcelona, Spain; Rio de Janiero, Brazil; Qingpu, China; and Kolkata, India that, in addition to quality control, are devoted primarily to applied research and development.
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $23.9 million, $22.5 million and $22.1 million, respectively.
 Most of Quaker’s subsidiaries and associated companies also have laboratory facilities.  Although not as complete as the laboratories mentioned above, these facilities are generally sufficient for the requirements of the customers being served.  If problems are encountered which cannot be resolved by local laboratories, such problems are generally referred to the laboratory staff in Conshohocken, Santa Fe Springs, Uithoorn or Qingpu.
 Regulatory Matters
 In order to facilitate compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and protection of the environment, the Company has an ongoing program of site assessment for the purpose of identifying capital expenditures or other actions that may be necessary to comply with such requirements.  The program includes periodic inspections of each facility by Quaker and/or independent experts, as well as ongoing inspections and training by on-site personnel. Such inspections address operational matters, record keeping, reporting requirements and capital improvements.  Capital expenditures directed solely or primarily to regulatory compliance amounted to approximately $1.6 million, $0.9 million and $2.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In 2018, the Company expects to incur approximately $2.4 million for capital expenditures directed primarily to regulatory compliance. 
Number of Employees
 On December 31, 2017, Quaker’s consolidated companies had approximately 2,110 full-time employees of whom approximately 640 were employed by the parent company and its U.S. subsidiaries, and approximately 1,470 were employed by its non-U.S. subsidiaries.  Associated companies of Quaker (in which it owns 50% or less and has significant influence) employed approximately 70 people on December 31, 2017.
Company Segmentation
 The Company’s reportable operating segments reflect the structure of the Company’s internal organization, the method by which the Company’s resources are allocated and the manner by which the Company assesses and manages its performance.  The Company’s reportable operating segments are organized by geography as follows: North America, EMEA, Asia/Pacific and South America. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report and is incorporated herein by this reference.
 Non-U.S. Activities
 Since significant revenues and earnings are generated by non-U.S. operations, Quaker’s financial results are affected by currency fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Chinese renminbi and the Indian rupee, and the impact of those currency fluctuations on the underlying economies. Incorporated by reference is (i) the foreign exchange risk information contained in Item 7A of this Report, (ii) the geographic information in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report and (iii) information regarding risks attendant to foreign operations included in Item 1A of this Report.

 Factors that May Affect Our Future Results
 (Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)
 Certain information included in this Report and other materials filed or to be filed by Quaker with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us) contain or may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, intentions, financial condition, results of operations, future performance, and business, including:

• | statements relating to our business strategy; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | our current and future results and plans; and 
• | statements that include the words “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan” or similar expressions. 

 Such statements include information relating to current and future business activities, operational matters, capital spending, and financing sources. From time to time, forward-looking statements are also included in Quaker’s other periodic reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, press releases, and other materials released to, or statements made to, the public.
 Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Report, in Quaker’s Annual Report to Shareholders for 2017 and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong.  This can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties.  Many factors discussed in this Report will be important in determining our future performance.  Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward-looking statements.
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in Quaker’s subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other related filings should be consulted. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond our control. A major risk is that the demand for the Company’s products and services is largely derived from the demand for our customers’ products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer’s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns. Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, significant increases in raw material costs, customer financial stability, worldwide economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, significant changes in applicable tax rates and regulations, future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, each of which is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A of this Report. Furthermore, the Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel, automobile, aircraft, appliance, and durable goods manufacturers. These risks, uncertainties, and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors beyond those discussed in this Report, could also adversely affect us including, but not limited to the following related to the Combination: 
 
• | the risk that a required regulatory approval will not be obtained or is subject to conditions that are not anticipated or acceptable to us; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the potential that regulatory authorities may require that we make divestitures in connection with the Combination of a greater amount than we anticipated, which would result in a smaller than anticipated combined business; 
• | the risk that a closing condition to the Combination may not be satisfied in a timely manner; 
• | risks associated with the financing of the Combination; 
• | the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the share purchase agreement; 
• | potential adverse effects on Quaker Chemical’s business, properties or operations caused by the implementation of the Combination; 
• | Quaker Chemical’s ability to promptly, efficiently and effectively integrate the operations of Houghton and Quaker Chemical; 
• | risks related to each company’s distraction from ongoing business operations due to the Combination; and, 
• | the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the companies related to the Combination. 

 Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.  For more information regarding these risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional risks that we face, see refer to the Risk Factors section, which appears in Item 1A of this report, as well as the proxy statement the Company filed on July 31, 2017 and in our quarterly and other reports filed from time to time with the SEC.  This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
