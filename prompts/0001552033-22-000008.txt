ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Overview 
TransUnion is a leading global information and insights company that makes trust possible between businesses and consumers, working to help people around the world access opportunities that can lead to a higher quality of life. That trust is built on TransUnion’s ability to deliver safe, innovative solutions with credibility and consistency. We call this Information for Good.
Grounded in our heritage as a credit reporting agency, we have built robust and accurate databases of information for a large portion of the adult population in the markets we serve. We use our data fusion methodology to link and match an increasing set of disparate data to further enrich our database. We use this enriched data, combined with our expertise, to continuously develop more insightful solutions for our customers, all in accordance with global laws and regulations. Because of our work, organizations can better understand consumers in order to make more informed decisions, and earn consumer trust through great, personalized experiences, and the proactive extension of the right opportunities, tools and offers. In turn, we believe consumers can be confident that their data identities will result in better offers and opportunities.
We provide solutions that enable businesses to manage and measure credit risk, market to new and existing customers, verify consumer identities, mitigate fraud, and effectively manage call center operations. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to deliver critical insights and enable effective actions. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal financial information and take precautions against identity theft. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, which we also refer to as verticals, including Financial Services and Emerging Verticals, which consists of Insurance, Services and Collections, Tenant and Employment, Technology, Commerce & Communications, Public Sector, Media, and other emerging verticals we serve, as well as our Neustar business. We have a global presence in over 30 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific. 
Our addressable market includes the global data and analytics market, which continues to grow as companies around the world increasingly recognize the benefits of data and analytics-based decision making, and as consumers recognize the important role that their data identities play in their ability to procure goods and services. There are several underlying trends supporting this market growth, including the proliferation of data, advances in technology and analytics that enable data to be processed more quickly and efficiently to provide business insights, and growing demand for these business insights across industries and geographies. Leveraging our established position as a leading provider of information and insights, we have grown our business by expanding the breadth and depth of our data, strengthening our analytics capabilities to deliver innovative solutions, expanding into complementary adjacencies and vertical markets, investing in technology infrastructure to leverage capabilities to best serve our customers, and enhancing our global operating model. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to expand our share within the markets we currently serve and capitalize on the larger data and analytics opportunity.
Our solutions are based on a foundation of data assets across financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, phone activity, digital device information, marketing, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information obtained from thousands of sources including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our acquisition of Neustar, Inc. (“Neustar”), and particularly its OneID platform, will further enhance our ability to deliver real-time, persistent identity resolution of disparate data fragments and attributes in a privacy compliant manner. Our technology infrastructure allows us to efficiently integrate our data with our analytics and technology capabilities to create and deliver innovative solutions to our customers and to quickly adapt to changing customer needs. Our deep analytics resources, including our people and tools driving predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enable us to provide businesses and consumers with better insights. 
We leverage our differentiated capabilities in order to serve a global customer base across multiple geographies and industry verticals. We offer our solutions to business customers in Financial Services, Insurance and other industries, and our customer base includes many of the largest companies in the industries we serve. We sell our solutions to leading consumer lending banks, credit card issuers, alternative lenders, online-only lenders (“FinTechs”), Point of Sale (“POS”)/Buy Now Pay Later (“BNPL”) lenders, auto lenders, auto insurance carriers, cable and telecom operators, retailers, and federal, state and local government agencies. We have been successful in leveraging our brand, our expertise and our solutions and have a leading presence in several high-growth international markets. Millions of consumers across the globe also use our data to help manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft.
We believe we have an attractive business model that has recurring and diversified revenue streams, low capital requirements, significant operating leverage and strong and stable cash flows. The proprietary and embedded nature of our solutions and the integral role that we play in our customers’ decision-making processes have historically translated into high customer retention and revenue visibility. We continue to deliver organic growth by increasing our sales to existing customers, developing new solutions and gaining new customers. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses across our segments, reducing our exposure to cyclical trends in any particular industry vertical or geography. We operate primarily on contributory data models in which we typically obtain updated information including a growing set of public record and alternative data at little or no cost, as we develop new solutions and expand into new industries and geographies. We are evolving our hybrid public-private cloud technology infrastructure to ensure that our systems remain highly secure, reliable, scalable, and performant by design. We are focused on processes and foundational technology that allows us to leverage demand-led consumption from public cloud providers and from our high performance privately owned infrastructure.
During 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. During 2021, we saw ongoing improvements in our results of operations in all the markets where we operate. However, given ongoing uncertainty and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the rise of variants of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines against those variants, COVID-19 may have a material and adverse impact on various aspects of our business in the future, including our results of operations.
Total revenues increased to $2,960.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2,530.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year increase of 17.0%. Our income from continuing operations increased to $370.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $305.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year increase of 21.2%. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1,156.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $953.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year increase of 21.3%. As of December 31, 2021, the book value of our debt was $6,365.9 million. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Key Performance Measures,” for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation to net income attributable to TransUnion.
Our Evolution 
We are dedicated to building upon our foundation as a global information and insights company that makes trust possible, so people around the world can access the opportunities that can lead to a higher quality of life. We have been in business for over 50 years and have established a long track record of providing innovative solutions to businesses and consumers. Since our founding as a provider of regional credit reporting services, we have built a comprehensive, valuable, and unique database of U.S. consumer information to build products that span many industry verticals. We have also strengthened our data, analytics and technology delivery capabilities and acquired complementary businesses enabling us to enhance our solutions. Leveraging our foundational strength in credit risk oriented products, we have also expanded our solution sets into complementary competencies such as fraud mitigation and digital marketing, which are further strengthened by our acquisition of Neustar and several acquisitions in our Media vertical.
Globally, we continue to grow our presence, building and acquiring credit reporting agencies in new geographies, establishing strong international footholds to expand into other emerging markets, and expanding the verticals served and solutions offered in local markets. We have also expanded the reach of our consumer solutions both directly and by partnering with other market leaders and innovators.
As part of our continued evolution, we have invested in a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will allow us to cater to the growing demand for data and analytics, provide differentiated solutions and better serve our customers. These initiatives include:
•Growing our Data: We continue to invest in the breadth and depth of our data. We introduced the concept of trended data to provide the trajectory of a consumer’s risk profile, used public records data to enhance the scope of business issues we can address, incorporated alternative data into our databases to allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment of banked and unbanked consumers, and have made several recent acquisitions in our Media vertical to add yet another dimension to our ability to match data in a digital world. Our acquisition of Neustar adds new digital identifier datasets, most notably phone activity data, as well as improved capabilities to link and match certain of our datasets. We believe we are the largest provider in the United States of both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data. We continue to improve the quality of our data, provide deeper insights and create differentiated solutions for our customers.
•Expanding into New Verticals and Geographic Markets: We have established and grown our presence in diversified verticals such as Insurance, Public Sector, and Media, as well as expanded our reach into the 
communications market with our acquisition of Neustar and the reach of our consumer offerings by partnering with traditional and emerging providers in new verticals. We have also diversified geographically by establishing a presence in attractive high-growth and strategic international markets such as the United Kingdom, India, Colombia and the Philippines. 
•Broadening our Solution Sets: From our foundation in the credit risk space, we have expanded into adjacent solution areas that can leverage our datasets and competencies, most notably fraud and marketing. Our Neustar acquisition adds scale and broadens the scope of our fraud and marketing solutions, which can be sold across verticals. 
•Strengthening our Analytics Capabilities: We have strengthened our analytics capabilities by leveraging modern technology and differentiated data assets, strategic acquisitions, utilizing more advanced tools and growing our analytics team. This has allowed us to create solutions that produce greater insights and more predictive results, which help our customers make better decisions. Our strengthened analytics capabilities have also shortened our time-to-market to create and deliver these solutions to our customers.
•Investing in our Technology: Technology is at the core of the solutions we provide to our customers. We continue to make significant investments to evolve our technology infrastructure by leveraging both internal and external resources. We also leverage the latest data and analytics technologies, enabling us to be quicker and increase our operational efficiency. Our significant ongoing investments allow us to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, improve delivery speeds, provide better availability, strengthen product development capabilities and continuously enhance our information security measures. With the acquisition of Neustar, we have bolstered our identity resolution capabilities through its OneID platform. Our technology also allows us to build and leverage capabilities across multiple geographies and industry verticals.
•Enhancing our Global Operating Model: We continue to enhance our business processes and capabilities to support our growth. We have structured our Global Solutions organization around key capabilities such as credit, fraud, marketing, analytics, decisioning, and others, and staffed the teams with experienced leaders to develop and diffuse configurable platform solutions across our geographies and vertical markets. Our Global Operations organization has centralized previously disparate functions, focusing on high-volume, repeatable activities that deliver consistent and predictable outcomes at speed. Our Global Technology organization has invested to further streamline our application ecosystem and optimize to more modern and services oriented architecture. To address our customers’ needs, we have hired additional industry experts, which has allowed us to create and sell new vertical-specific solutions. Our global sales force structure includes dedicated teams for our largest customers, shared sales teams for our mid-sized customers, and call center support teams for our smaller customers, which increases our sales team’s effectiveness across our target markets.
We believe that our ongoing focus on evolving with the market and with our customers’ needs ensures continued improvement in our overall services to businesses and consumers. Leveraging our trusted brand, global scale and strong market position in the verticals we serve will allow us to capitalize on business opportunities worldwide and contribute to our long-term growth.
Our Market Opportunity 
We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term trend of businesses and consumers using data and analytics to make more informed decisions and manage risk more effectively. As worldwide spending on data and analytics increases, we believe there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment affecting the geographies and industry verticals we serve that will create increasing demand for our solutions:
•Rapid Growth in Data Creation and Application: Larger and more diversified datasets are now assembled faster while the breadth of analytical applications and solutions has expanded. Companies are increasingly relying on business analytics and data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. Non-traditional sources of data have become important in deriving alternative metrics. 
•Proliferation of Digital Commerce: Increases in online purchasing activity, particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, is creating new challenges and opportunities for businesses and consumers. Businesses are looking for solutions to improve targeting precision and identity verification in these digital environments, in order to enable better consumer experiences. We believe there is ample demand for data and insights to help businesses make better decisions, leveraging digital identity information and advanced analytics. Additionally, consumers are seeking more frictionless digital experiences, while also gaining a heightened awareness of and concern about the risks of identity theft. 
•Advances in Technology and Analytics Unlocking the Value of Data: Ongoing advances in data collection, storage and analytics technology have contributed to the greater use and value of data and analytics in decision making. As businesses have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data, they increasingly expect access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. We 
believe this has made sophisticated technology critical for gaining and retaining business in the risk and information services industry.
•Greater Adoption of Data Solutions Across New and Existing Industry Verticals: With the proliferation of data, we believe companies across new and existing industry verticals recognize the value of risk information and analytical tools, particularly when tailored to their specific needs.
▪Financial Services Industry:  There is strong competition in the financial services space, with traditional financial services companies and consumer lenders competing against an increasing number of new FinTechs and POS/BNPL lenders. FinTechs and POS/BNPL lenders provide access to credit in a fast and efficient manner by utilizing sophisticated risk assessment tools that leverage data, such as behavioral data, transactional data and employment and credit information. Traditional lenders are also increasing their use of these new applications and data in order to grow their businesses while addressing regulatory requirements, lowering operating costs and better serving their customers.
▪Insurance Industry: As consumers increasingly obtain quotes from multiple insurers in an effort to lower their costs, insurers are trying to improve the accuracy of their risk assessments and initial quotes. For example, insurance carriers are using driver violation data to uncover offenses that will impact pricing earlier in the quoting process so consumers have a more accurate view of the premiums they will be charged.
▪Other Emerging Verticals:  In addition to insurance, we offer solutions in a diversified portfolio of other emerging verticals, which now includes our recent acquisition of Neustar, as well as Tenant and Employment, Services and Collections, Public Sector, Media and others. Neustar provides solutions across marketing, risk and communications, with strong customer relationships across financial services, telecommunications, and media verticals, among others. Our Tenant and Employment business provides data and insights to make informed investment, hiring, and rental decisions. In Services and Collections, our solutions improve third party collectors’ bottom line and help provide a quality customer experience by delivering actionable consumer insights and services. Within the Media vertical, our highly accurate consumer data helps companies improve their marketing investments, providing identity and audience solutions to reach the right consumers across digital channels. Our suite of solutions in the Public Sector gives government agencies the superior data assets, analytics, and security they need to manage compliance and boost services for the constituents they serve. We also offer data-driven solutions in other verticals that address the entire customer lifecycle in industries such as technology, commerce and communications, services, and retail.
•Increasing Lending Activity in Emerging International Markets: As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked consumers. In addition, credit penetration, as measured by the proportion of credit active adults, is relatively low in emerging markets, such as India. Furthermore, the widespread adoption and use of mobile phones in emerging markets have enabled greater levels of financial inclusion and access to banking and credit. We expect the populations in emerging markets to continue to become more credit active, resulting in increased demand for our services.
•Increased Management and Monitoring of Personal Financial Information and Identity Protection by Consumers: We expect demand for consumer solutions to continue to rise with greater consumer awareness of the importance and usage of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and increasingly available free credit information. The proliferation of mobile devices has also made data much more accessible, enabling consumers to manage their finances and monitor their information in real-time. We believe these trends will continue to drive growth for our consumer business. Our acquisition of Sontiq, Inc. (“Sontiq”) in particular expands our value proposition in the identity protection space.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Comprehensive and Unique Datasets
Our long operating history and thought leadership in the industry have allowed us to build comprehensive and unique data assets that would be difficult for a new market entrant to replicate. Our solutions are based on a foundation of financial, credit, alternative credit, fraud, marketing, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, automotive and other relevant information obtained from thousands of sources including financial institutions, private databases, public records repositories, and other alternative data sources. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. We are constantly updating our data to keep it current, and we continue to identify opportunities to acquire additional data. We believe that our data is unique and differentiates us from our competitors. We own several proprietary datasets such as consumer credit information, driver violation history, phone activity, digital device identifiers, business data and rental payment history. Our global data assets encompass alternative data, such as the voter registry in India, a vehicle information database in 
South Africa, and a mobile device database from our acquisition of iovation, Inc. (“iovation”). We believe we are the largest provider of scale in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers.
Innovative and Differentiated Solutions
We consistently focus on innovation to develop new and enhanced solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe our specialized data, analytics and solution service, as well as our collaborative approach with our customers, differentiates us from our competitors. Our solutions are often scalable across different customers, geographies and verticals. Several examples of our innovative and differentiated solutions include: 
•CreditVision: We continue to enhance our credit data by including new data fields, enriching values in existing data fields and expanding account history. Our enhanced credit data has been combined with hundreds of algorithms to produce CreditVision and CreditVision Link, the market-leading trended data and alternative data solutions that provide greater granularity and evaluate consumer behavior patterns over time. This results in a more predictive view of the consumer, increases the total population of consumers who can effectively be scored, and helps consumers gain improved pricing.
•Marketing: Our Marketing Solutions offer advanced depth, breadth, and sophistication of the marketing identity graph, leveraging new identity signals, such as in-home connected devices, and new matching models/algorithms that deepen the configurability of matched outcomes, and expanding always-on points of distribution to connect to more technology and media end-points. We have continued the expansion of audience creation tools and data availability, including an expanded set of available attributes and tools available to marketers for the rapid development and deployment of highly targeted audience segments. Our Advanced Automation for Analytics suite includes ongoing development of scenario planning and automated allocation tools that enable rapid marketing investment optimization based on detailed performance analysis.
•TruValidate: Our TruValidate solutions secure trust across channels and deliver friction-right experiences that empower businesses and consumers to safely and seamlessly transact in a digital world. TruValidate provides an enhanced suite of identity management, authentication, and fraud analytics solutions that protect businesses from fraud, increase acquisition rates and consumer loyalty, and optimize business operations. We continue to invest in innovative identity proofing and authentication services and to expand our comprehensive consumer identity graph to translate the connections between personal and digital data into consumer trust decisions across their omni-channel journey. Further, we expanded our capabilities in the fraud space with our acquisition of Neustar. Neustar’s capabilities enhances our ability to provide superior consumer identity insights and make trust possible between businesses and consumers.
•TLOxp: TLOxp leverages proprietary data linking and matching capabilities across thousands of data sources to identify and provide insights on relationships among specific people, assets, locations, and businesses. This allows us to offer enhanced due diligence, investigation, risk management, threat assessment, identity authentication, and fraud prevention and detection solutions. Our ongoing investment in data, analytics, and innovation allows us to continue to help our customers improve critical aspects of their business and to expand our value proposition to serve additional use cases and verticals such as government, law enforcement, insurance, and healthcare.
•CreditView: CreditView is an interactive, customer-branded dashboard that empowers consumers to take control of their credit health by providing them with credit information, insights, and educational tools in a comprehensive, user-friendly format. Consumers are able to easily view their credit profiles, see how they have changed over time, receive alerts on key credit changes, simulate the impact of financial decisions on their credit score, understand recommended actions to attain a desired score range, and receive relevant offers for financial products.
With our acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq, we enhanced our innovative suite of solutions, including the following notable solutions: 
•Caller Name Services (“CNAM”): Caller Name Services (CNAM) is a Neustar solution that manages the CallerID ecosystem for the majority of U.S. communication services providers. CNAM applies proprietary methodologies to aggregate, build, cleanse, and manage data to clearly and efficiently display a caller’s identity.
•Trusted Call Solutions: Trusted Call Solutions is a Neustar solution that helps enterprises and communications providers reduce robocalling and spoofing, promote their brand, and improve call answer rates. Solutions include caller name optimization, robocall mitigation, certified caller, and branded call display.
•IdentityForce: IdentityForce is a Sontiq solution that provides identity protection services to consumers, including credit report monitoring, dark web monitoring, identity restoration services, and stolen fund disbursement, all in a 
flexible and user-friendly interface. Additional premium services include credit score simulators, bank monitoring, and reputation monitoring, among other features.
Technology Infrastructure 
While technology advances never cease, we continue to evolve our infrastructure and our capabilities to efficiently interface with our clients in the business ecosystems in which we participate. The need to further expand and evolve our enterprise approach to technology has become more significant as TransUnion has become an increasingly global company. Our technology infrastructure allows us to continually improve our overall services to businesses and consumers and ensures that we are well positioned to differentiate our datasets and capabilities. We believe our technology infrastructure capabilities have resulted in increased throughput, improved data matching, greater efficiency, advanced platform flexibility, better information security, and lower operating costs.
•Powerful Data Capabilities: Our technology gives us the ability to process, organize and analyze high volumes of data across multiple operating systems, databases and file types as well as to deal with both structured and unstructured data that changes frequently. We process billions of transactions on a daily basis.
•Enhanced Linking and Matching: Because our data matching technology is able to interrelate data across disparate sources, industries and time periods, we believe that we are able to create differentiated datasets and provide our customers with comprehensive insights that allow them to better evaluate risk. Neustar’s OneID platform will further enhance our ability to deliver real-time, persistent identity resolution of disparate data fragments and attributes in a privacy compliant manner.
•Continuing Evolution of Our Hybrid Public-Private Cloud Infrastructure: At the beginning of 2020, we announced an initiative to further enhance our technology infrastructure through a multi-year investment that we refer to as Project Rise. This investment is a continuing evolution of our hybrid public-private cloud infrastructure, and is a significant upgrade to our existing infrastructure. Project Rise is an initiative designed to ensure that our technology is even more effective, efficient, secure and reliable, which we believe will enable us to perform at our highest level across all of TransUnion. Our investment will be concentrated in streamlining processes, increasing automation, and rapidly adopting a hybrid public and private cloud approach globally for a state-of-the-art technology infrastructure. We are focused on building new capabilities and developing our talent internally, to create an efficient cloud-native workforce that will provide us long-term, sustained benefits. 
The benefits we expect to realize under Project Rise include:
▪refactoring and optimizing our applications into a more modern API-based and microservices-oriented architecture. 
▪simplifying the delivery of our intellectual property on a global basis, further increasing our speed-to-market. We will more easily push our intellectual property into the public cloud and then pull it down for use in a given market. This approach will help us continue our rapid international expansion and more effortlessly deploy solutions across our markets.
▪creating meaningful scaled economies around company-driven consumption of our infrastructure using cloud-based technology. We will consume and pay for only needed infrastructure as we develop new applications. Using this infrastructure-as-code approach eliminates the time-consuming manual provisioning process and replaces it with auto-provisioning from either the private cloud or a public cloud provider. 
▪utilizing readily available innovative tools from cloud-service providers instead of developing them ourselves. This shift will enable faster product development through new compliance tools, model training, machine learning and other cutting-edge technologies. By employing more highly automated tools with auto-provisioning infrastructure, our developers will focus on value-added, revenue generating work, freeing them from traditional preparation and enablement activities. 
▪accessing the new public cloud business models. For example, public cloud providers have been building application and data marketplaces. This move will help ensure that no matter how data and applications are delivered to customers, whether through a public cloud marketplace or our own Prama DataHub, we will be able to participate.
We have made considerable progress with Project Rise, including the development of a global credit reporting platform to enable consistently higher performance across all global markets. The platform is already deployed locally in Brazil, where we recently received approval to operate as a credit bureau.
With the acquisition of Neustar, we have a unique opportunity to expand the scope of Project Rise, leveraging Neustar’s OneID platform and their established cloud competence to power our non-credit products. We believe this will result in a more scalable, secure, efficient and effective environment, with an upskilled technology workforce, while being cloud provider 
agnostic. This set of capabilities and customer solutions will help us pursue the objectives of Project Rise in a more comprehensive way.
 Deep and Specialized Industry Expertise
We have deep expertise in a number of attractive industry verticals including Financial Services, Insurance and other verticals. Our expertise has allowed us to develop sophisticated vertical-specific solutions within these targeted industries that play an integral role in our customers’ decision-making processes and are often embedded into their workflows. Our team includes industry experts with significant experience in the verticals that we target and relationships with leading companies in those verticals. We also have regulatory compliance expertise across the industries that we serve. Together, this expertise provides us with a comprehensive understanding of business trends and insights for customers in these verticals, allowing us to build solutions that cater to these customers’ specific requirements. We have been able to apply our industry knowledge, data assets, technology and analytics capabilities to develop new solutions and revenue opportunities within key verticals. For example, in Financial Services, our differentiated position allowed us to anticipate the increased demand from alternative consumer lending providers, including the prevalence of POS/BNPL lending, to create solutions that catered to these emerging providers. In Insurance, we partnered with a vehicle history data provider to launch a vehicle history score that helps insurance carriers further segment risk based on the attributes of a specific automobile. In Marketing, we recognized that we already had the foundational datasets we needed to compete in audience segmentation and identity resolution, made strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and acquired Neustar to broaden our customer base and deepen our solution capabilities.
Leading Presence in Attractive International Markets
We have been operating internationally for over 30 years and have strong global brand recognition. We have strategically targeted attractive international markets in both developed and emerging economies and have a diversified global presence, including a strong presence in Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific. Local senior management in our International markets provide us with deeper insights into these markets and stronger relationships with our customers. We have leveraged our brand, operating history, global footprint and technology infrastructure to establish new credit bureaus in several international markets, such as Canada in 1989, India in 2001 and the Philippines in 2011. Once we establish a foothold in a region, our model is to expand the services we offer within these markets and then move into adjacent emerging markets. For example, we have used our operations in Hong Kong to expand into other Asia Pacific countries and provide analytic scoring models in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. We have used our operations in South Africa to expand into neighboring African countries. We have also entered new markets through strategic acquisitions, including Brazil in 2011, Colombia in 2016, and the United Kingdom in 2018.
Proven and Experienced Management Team
Our senior management team has a proven track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve, with decades of industry experience. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent for our businesses. Our team has deep knowledge of the data and analytics sector and expertise across the various industries that we serve. Our team has overseen our expansion into new industries and geographies, while managing ongoing strategic initiatives including our significant technology investments. As a result of the sustained focus of our management team, we have been successful in consistently driving growth, both organically and through acquiring and integrating businesses.
Our Growth Strategy 
Enhance Underlying Data, Technology and Analytics Capabilities to Develop Innovative Solutions
As the demand for data and analytics solutions grows across industries and geographies, we will continue to expand the scope of our underlying data, improve our tools and technology and enhance our analytics and technology solutions capabilities to provide innovative solutions that address this demand. As the needs of businesses and consumers continue to evolve, we continue to help them meet their challenges, which our ongoing investments in data, technology and analytics enable us to do more quickly and efficiently, for example with machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning. With our insights and information, our customers can explore connections between people, businesses, assets and locations; identify assets, uncover inconsistencies and identify misrepresentations; and uncover evidence of financial distress. 
Our continuous technology investments have also reduced the time to market for new solutions, which allow us to react quickly to customer requirements. In addition, these investments also improve efficiency, reliability, security, and performance. We also continue to take advantage of strategic partnerships that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, by leveraging our fast, available, and secure technology infrastructure and working together with one of our strategic partners we were able to provide real-time credit decisions in a matter of seconds, enabling the use of a new virtual credit card through consumers’ digital wallets.
Further Penetrate Existing Industry Verticals with Current and New Solutions
We are a leading provider of risk and information solutions in several industry verticals today, including Financial Services and Insurance. We believe there is significant opportunity for further growth within these industries by expanding the number of customers to whom we sell our current solutions as well as by creating innovative new solutions that we can use to grow our presence in these industries. We focus on developing new solutions that address evolving customer needs within our industry verticals. In order to more effectively address these opportunities, we have redeployed and reallocated our sales resources to focus either on new customer opportunities or on selling additional services and solutions to existing customers. With our leading market positions, existing strong relationships in the Financial Services and Insurance verticals, and with our consumer partners, we believe we have the opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base and capture a strong proportion of their spending across the consumer lifecycle.
Establish Positions in New, Adjacent Industry Verticals
In addition to increasing penetration in industries where we have a substantial presence, we continue to create solutions that address customer needs in attractive new industries. Our strategy is to identify new solutions that can then be deployed to other markets where they may be applicable. We believe that our capabilities allow us to quickly create and deliver solutions to new industries and geographies where information-based analytics and technology solutions capabilities are currently underutilized. We continue to target other verticals such as Public Sector, Tenant and Employment, and Media, where we see opportunities to leverage our existing data, analytics and technology solutions capabilities. Our Neustar acquisition is highly complementary from a vertical perspective, with strong positions in Financial Services, Retail, Telecom, and Media. Neustar’s heritage strength with Telecom providers represents an expanded growth opportunity for TransUnion.
Extend Further Into Fraud and Marketing Solutions
From our heritage in the credit risk space, we have expanded into adjacent solution areas that can leverage our datasets and competencies, most notably fraud and marketing. These solutions have broad applicability across the customers that we serve, including in key verticals such as financial services, insurance and public sector. We have broadened these capabilities through acquisitions, most notably iovation in 2018 and three subsequent acquisitions in 2019 and 2020, to build out our Media vertical. In addition, our 2021 acquisition of Neustar adds scale and broadens the scope of our fraud and marketing solutions, which can be sold across verticals. 
Expand our Presence in Attractive International Markets
We believe international markets present a significant opportunity for growth. We have significant scale in some of the world’s fastest growing markets, such as India and Latin America, which positions us to take advantage of the favorable dynamics in these regions as their populations become more credit active. We leverage solutions developed in the United States and deploy them to international markets, after localizing them to individual market requirements. For example, after launching CreditVision in the United States, we have expanded our offerings with similar solutions globally. In markets where we have established a presence, we will expand further into adjacent verticals, such as Insurance and Consumer Solutions, as well as complementary solutions, such as marketing and fraud. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by forming alliances with financial services institutions, industry associations and other local partners, and by pursuing strategic acquisitions. Across all our international expansion initiatives, we will continue to leverage our technology infrastructure to drive speed to market, scale and differentiation.
Broaden Our Reach in Consumer Market through Direct and Indirect Channels 
Our consumer business continues to deliver growth with strong margins, driven by our innovative solutions and flexible and collaborative partnership model that has expanded the market for consumer services, along with greater consumer awareness of the value of their credit information and increased risk of identity theft. With our acquisition of Sontiq, we have added to our foundational credit monitoring solutions with a comprehensive set of identity protection offerings. Our strategy is to grow our own member base in the direct channel as well as expand our reach through partnerships in the indirect channel. Across both channels, our focus is on delivering value-added solutions and features while continuing to improve the consumer experience with more user-friendly interfaces and better customer service and educational tools. Within our indirect channel, we will continue to leverage and enhance our flexible technology platform to expand our relationship with existing partners as well as develop relationships with new partners and enter new verticals. We believe that partnerships not only enable us to grow our own business, but also expand the overall market and provide us access to new consumer segments. We will also continue to leverage our approach in the U.S. consumer market to further expand our consumer operations globally.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
We will continue to pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth within our existing businesses and diversify into new businesses. We are focused primarily on opportunities that expand our geographic footprint, increase the breadth and depth of our datasets, 
enhance our services, provide us with industry expertise in our key verticals and deepen our presence in our international markets.
On December 1, 2021, we completed two of our largest investments in the history of the company with the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq. Neustar, a premier identity resolution company with leading solutions in Marketing, Risk and Communications, enables customers to build connected consumer experiences by combining decision analytics with real-time identity resolution services driven by its OneID platform. We believe the acquisition of Neustar provides immediate scale to our identity resolution services through Neustar’s large, well-established customer base, accelerates the future growth of our identity-based solutions and expands our powerful digital identity capabilities through the addition of Neustar’s distinctive data and analytics, enabling consumers and businesses to transact online with greater confidence. 
Sontiq provides solutions including identity monitoring, restoration, and response products and services to empower consumers and businesses to help proactively protect against identity theft and cyber threats. The acquisition of Sontiq enables access to an attractive new base of customers and consumers through a recurring subscription-based revenue model and also complements and expands our Consumer Interactive solutions portfolio by providing valuable identity protection services for consumers. Sontiq’s identity security monitoring products incorporate our credit data, are highly complementary to our capabilities and are expected to significantly increase our opportunities for growth.
In our Media vertical, we have made three recent acquisitions, Tru Optik Data Corp. (“TruOptik”), Signal Digital, Inc. (“Signal”) and TruSignal, Inc. (TruSignal”), which provide us with an industry-leading position within a clearly defined part of the Media industry. These acquisitions allow us to deliver more real-time targeted data across online streaming services to improve our customers’ digital marketing campaigns. Together with TransUnion’s complementary capabilities, we believe these acquisitions allow us to enhance the customer base with higher accuracy and transparency that is missing in current identity and audience development products in the digital marketing space. 
We enhanced our fraud and identity management service offerings when we acquired iovation in June 2018, one of the most advanced providers of device-based information in the world. We launched IDVision with iovation, which combines our extensive personal data with iovation’s digital data to offer an enhanced suite of identity management, authentication and fraud prevention solutions that protect businesses from fraud while improving the online user experience. This results in a global network of fraud and risk insights that help businesses to quickly and accurately determine authentic customers from fraudulent ones.
We continue to seek opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and further accelerate our growth. In June 2018, we entered the world’s second largest credit market in the U.K. Our U.K. business provides data, analytics and technology solutions to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions across a diverse group of industries. With a strong record of growth and innovation in both core credit and emerging solutions we have achieved strong market success.
In addition to the above, over the years we have completed a number of other acquisitions. We have also made a number of minority investments in businesses, which typically include strategic partnership arrangements that allow us to develop, expand, and deepen relationships with innovative companies with promising technologies and capabilities. We have a strong track record of integrating our acquisitions and driving long-term value creation, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pursuing acquisitions.
Segment Overview 
We manage our business and report our financial results in three reportable segments: U.S. Markets, International and Consumer Interactive. We also report expenses for Corporate, which provides shared services and conducts enterprise functions. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” and Note 20, “Reportable Segments,” for further information about our reportable segments.
U.S. Markets
Our U.S. Markets segment provides consumer reports, actionable insights and analytics to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and mitigate fraud risk.
We deliver our solutions across multiple industry vertical markets and report disaggregated revenue as follows:
Financial Services: The Financial Services vertical, which accounts for approximately 60.2% of our 2021 U.S. Markets revenue, consists of our consumer lending, mortgage, auto and cards and payments lines of business. Our financial services customers consist of most banks, credit unions, finance companies, auto lenders, mortgage lenders, FinTechs, and other consumer lenders in the United States. We also distribute our solutions through most major resellers, secondary market players and sales agents. Beyond traditional lenders, we work with a variety of credit arrangers, such as auto dealers and peer-to-peer lenders. We provide solutions across every aspect of the lending lifecycle; customer acquisition and engagement, fraud and ID 
management, retention and recovery. Our products are focused on mitigating risk and include credit reporting, credit marketing, analytics and consulting, identity verification and authentication and debt recovery solutions.
Emerging Verticals: Emerging Verticals include Insurance, Services and Collections, Tenant and Employment, Technology, Commerce & Communications, Public Sector, Media, and other emerging verticals we serve, as well as our Neustar business. Our solutions in these verticals are also data-driven and address the entire customer lifecycle. We offer onboarding and transaction processing products, scoring and analytic products, marketing solutions, fraud and identity management solutions and customer retention solutions.
Within U.S. Markets, we leverage our comprehensive data assets, data matching expertise and predictive analytics to develop solutions:
•Comprehensive Data Assets:  Our credit database contains the name and address of substantially all of the U.S. credit-active population, a listing of their existing credit relationships and their timeliness in repaying debt obligations. The information in our database is voluntarily provided by thousands of credit-granting institutions and other data furnishers. We enhance our data assets with alternative credit sources. We also actively source information from courts, government agencies and other public records including suits, liens, judgments, bankruptcies, professional licenses, real property, vehicle ownership, other assets, driver violations, criminal records and contact information for certain databases. We also have proprietary datasets including device-based information and phone activity data, and continue to look for opportunities to gain access to new datasets. Our databases are updated, reviewed and monitored on a regular basis.
•Predictive Analytics:  Our predictive analytics capabilities allow us to analyze our proprietary datasets and provide insights to our customers to allow them to drive better business decisions. Our tools allow customers to investigate past behavior, reasonably predict the likelihood of future events and strategize actions based on those predictions. We have numerous tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking, forecasting, fraud modeling and campaign optimization, all of which cater to specific customer requirements. Our predictive analytics capabilities are developed by an analytics team with deep industry experience and a broad array of specialized qualifications.
International
The International segment provides services similar to our U.S. Markets segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and technology solutions services and other value-added risk management services. We also have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer solutions similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment to help consumers proactively manage their personal finances. We report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions:
Canada: We have operated in Canada since 1989 and are one of only two nationwide consumer reporting agencies in the Canadian market. We operate across multiple verticals in Canada with leading positions in insurance and automotive with a strong and growing presence in Financial Services. Our Canadian customer base encompasses some of the largest companies in their verticals, including many of the top banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies and auto manufacturer lenders.
Latin America: We have been active in Latin America since 1985 when we entered the Puerto Rican market, and now operate in numerous Central and South American countries, including a strong presence in two major markets - Colombia and Brazil. We also have significant credit bureau businesses in the Dominican Republic and Chile, and a 25.69% ownership interest in Trans Union de México, S.A., the primary credit reporting agency in Mexico. In Guatemala, we maintain a centralized database that services Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
United Kingdom: In June 2018, we entered the world’s second largest credit market, the United Kingdom, when we acquired Callcredit, the second largest consumer credit bureau in the U.K. Our U.K. business provides data, analytics and technology solutions to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions across a diverse group of industries, and serves a broad set of customers including leading financial institutions and customers in other attractive, high-growth segments. 
Africa: We launched our operations in Africa by entering South Africa in 1993, and have since expanded into many surrounding countries. We are highly diversified and serve a variety of industries through traditional consumer credit reporting services, insurance solutions, auto information solutions, and commercial credit information services. We provide risk and information solutions in Africa to many of the leading banks, retailers, auto dealer groups, and insurance companies. 
India: In 2001, we partnered with prominent Indian financial institutions to create CIBIL, the first consumer and business credit reporting agency in India. We have since launched the country’s first generic credit score, which is the most widely used credit 
score across the financial services industry in India. In the absence of a comprehensive national ID, we created an innovative matching algorithm that allowed us to create the most extensive consumer credit database in India. We also own or have access to several non-credit data sources that we use to enhance our solutions, including the national voters’ registry, the confirmed and suspected fraud registry, property registry and tax ID database. We offer a suite of risk and information solutions across the credit lifecycle for banks, telecommunication companies and insurance companies, as well as consumer solutions such as online credit reports and scores. India has become our second largest and our fastest growing region.
Asia Pacific: Our operations in Asia Pacific include markets such as Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and China. Asia Pacific is a growing market with increasing demand for credit driven by a rising middle class that offers significant growth potential in analytics and technology solutions. We do business with many of the top financial institutions in the countries we serve. We have had a majority ownership interest in the principal consumer credit reporting company in Hong Kong since 1998. In partnership with leading credit card issuers in the Philippines, we launched the first consumer credit reporting agency in that market in 2011. We have also built credit risk scores for the National Credit Bureau of Thailand, in which we have a 12.25% ownership interest, the Credit Bureau of Singapore and the Credit Bureau of Malaysia.
Consumer Interactive
The Consumer Interactive segment offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, identity protection and resolution, and financial management for consumers. The segment also provides solutions that help businesses respond to data breach events. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. With our acquisition of Sontiq in 2021, we have added to our foundational credit monitoring solutions with a comprehensive set of identity protection offerings. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels.
Direct: We provide services directly to consumers, primarily on a subscription basis through websites and mobile applications. Product features include credit reports, credit scores and analysis, alerts to changes in credit information, debt analysis, debt and retirement calculators, identity protection services, and the ability to restrict third-party access to a consumer’s TransUnion and Equifax credit reports, commonly known as a “credit freeze,” through our paid subscription offering, and free credit freezes and credit reports. We complement these features with educational content that explains how credit and financial data is used in various industries to evaluate consumers and how a consumer’s financial choices impact this evaluation. Our integrated, data-driven marketing strategy spans multiple channels including paid search, online display and email, which allows us to efficiently acquire and retain high quality consumers.
Indirect: We also provide our services to partners who may offer them on a stand-alone basis or with their own or other branded services as a bundle to consumers, governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection, credit monitoring, identity protections, and data breach services. We offer a broad suite of solutions that include many of the features, educational content and customer support available in our direct channel. We have taken a proactive and flexible partnership approach, which has resulted in long-term strategic relationships with some of the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services in the U.S. consumer market as well as with several large financial institutions. Through these partnerships, we have significantly expanded the overall market as well as our ability to provide consumers with the information and tools they want.
Corporate
Corporate provides support services to each segment, holds investments and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically enterprise-level costs and are primarily administrative in nature. 
Markets and Customers 
We have a highly diversified customer base that includes companies across multiple industries, including Financial Services and Insurance. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from companies in the financial services industry and from sales in the United States.
We leverage our comprehensive data assets, industry expertise and our technology infrastructure, allowing us to build solutions once and deploy them multiple times across the different verticals and regions. Our evolution to a hybrid public-private cloud infrastructure augments this capability. We provide services to our customers through real-time, online delivery for services such as credit reports and predictive scores, in batch form for services that help our customers proactively acquire new customers, cross-sell to existing customers and help them monitor and manage risk, and through our software-as-a-service offerings, which include a number of solutions that help businesses interpret data, maximize reimbursements, visualize insights, predict model results and apply their customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time automated decisions at the time of customer interaction, and through our websites to consumers, for various subscription-based and transaction-based products in the United States and in other regions we serve.
We market our services globally, primarily through our own sales force. We have dedicated sales teams for our largest customers focused by industry group and geography. These dedicated sales teams provide strategic account management and direct support to customers. We use shared sales teams to sell our services to mid-size customers. Smaller customers’ sales needs are serviced primarily through call centers. We also market our services through indirect channels such as resellers, who sell directly to businesses and consumers. Our interactive direct-to-consumer services are sold primarily through our website.
Seasonality 
Seasonality in the U.S. Markets segment is correlated to volumes of online credit data purchased by our financial services and mortgage customers, and our sales have generally been higher during the second and third quarters. Seasonality in our International segment is driven by local economic conditions and relevant macroeconomic market trends. In our Consumer Interactive segment, demand for our products is usually higher in the first half of the year, impacted by seasonality and our advertising spend. 
Competition
The market for our services is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of differentiated solutions, datasets, analytics capabilities, ease of integration with our customers’ technology, stability of services, customer relationships, innovation and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Our competitors vary based on the business segment, industry vertical and geographical market that our solutions address.
In our U.S. Markets segment, our competition generally includes Equifax, Experian and LexisNexis, in addition to certain competitors with whom we only compete in specific industry verticals. For example, we compete with FICO in the Financial Services vertical and with Verisk Analytics, Inc. in the Insurance vertical. In marketing solutions, we compete with Experian and LiveRamp.
In our International segment, we generally compete with Equifax and Experian directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries or investments. We also compete with other competitors that may focus on a particular vertical, country or region.
In our Consumer Interactive segment, we generally compete with Equifax, Experian, FICO and LifeLock as well as personal finance websites, some of whom offer free credit information.
In addition to these competitors, we also compete with a number of other companies that may offer niche solutions catering to more specific customer requirements.
We believe the services we provide to our customers reflect our understanding of our customers’ businesses, the depth and breadth of our data and the quality of our analytics and technology solutions capabilities. By integrating our services into our customers’ workflows, we ensure efficiency, continuous improvement and long-lasting relationships.
Information Technology
Technology 
The continuous operation of our information technology systems is fundamental to our business. Our information technology systems collect, refine, access, process, deliver and store the data that is used to provide our solutions. Our technology relies on several third-party best-of-breed solutions as well as proprietary software and tools which we integrate into our platforms. Our control of our technology and infrastructure allows us to prioritize any changes and manage the roll-out of any upgrades or changes. We contract with various third-party providers to help us maintain and support our systems.
We have established technology Centers-of-Excellence that utilize similar tools and technology in order to provide scale and efficiency in modifying existing applications and developing new applications for our businesses. We deploy new development methodologies globally to enable rapid delivery of solutions and increase our speed-to-market. Our technology team includes both our own employees as well as additional resources from third-party providers.
We believe that our technology is at the core of our innovative solutions, and we continually invest in our technology and thought leaders to be a market leader. We continue to make significant investments in our infrastructure to leverage the latest data and analytics technologies. 
We believe that our technology platform enables us to be quicker, more efficient and more cost-effective across each step of our process chain, including receiving, consolidating and updating data, implementing analytics and technology solutions capabilities, creating innovative solutions, delivering those solutions to our customers and incorporating customer feedback. Our platform has significant scale and capacity and enables us to deliver actionable information immediately to our customers as well as expand customer segments and develop solutions to meet new needs. Our technology infrastructure gives us the ability to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, maintain and improve our delivery speeds, increase availability and enhance our product development capabilities, while at the same time lowering our overall cost structure. We are also 
investing in our digital employee experience; we believe that to attract and retain talent we need to ensure an efficient and productive environment.
Data Centers and Business Continuity
In order to create redundancy and increase resiliency, we utilize multiple data centers in all of our major markets. We generally employ similar technologies and infrastructures in each data center to enable the optimal sharing of technical resources across geographies.
We maintain a framework for business continuity that includes written policies requiring each business and operating unit to identify critical functions. Our businesses and operating units have processes in place that are designed to maintain such functions in case there is a disruptive event. We also have a specific disaster recovery plan that will take effect if critical infrastructure or systems fail or become disabled.
As part of our program, each business unit’s continuity plan is periodically updated and stored in a centralized database. These plans are monitored and reviewed by our compliance team. From time to time, our compliance team tests one or more of these plans using desktop exercises or in connection with actual events. We also periodically confirm the state of preparedness of our most critical disaster recovery procedures. We maintain systems redundancy plans for our primary U.S. data centers that allow for the transfer of capacity between geographically disbursed environments in the event there is a failure of computer hardware or a loss of our primary telecommunications lines or power sources. On an enterprise basis, our systems are designed to recover most of our operational capacity in a scenario where our primary data centers become inoperable.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business continuity plans have kept us well positioned to continue to successfully operate our business. In each of the markets we serve, we quickly and effectively moved to a work-from-home model that we generally continue to adhere to today. This has allowed us to protect our associates and the broader population while continuing to operate our businesses and provide services and solutions to customers and consumers.
Security
The security and protection of personal data is TransUnion’s highest priority. TransUnion’s written information security program focuses on managing risk and fulfilling global information security regulations and standards, including ISO/IEC 27001:2013, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other international regulatory expectations in locations where we operate. Our information security program follows a risk-based approach that continuously evaluates threats, industry events and asset values to introduce enhancements when necessary. We deploy a wide range of physical and technical safeguards that provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information we have in our possession or with our partners. These safeguards include firewalls, intrusion protection and monitoring, anti-virus and malware protection, vulnerability threat analysis, management and testing, advanced persistent threat monitoring, forensic tools, encryption technologies, data transmission standards, contractual provisions, customer and partner credentialing, identity and access management, data loss, access and anomaly reports and training programs for associates. We, with other global financial services organizations, including U.S. nationwide consumer credit reporting companies, share cyber threat and attack information through our participation in the Financial Information Sharing and Analysis Council and other forums that may be targeted at our industry to better understand and monitor our systems and our connectivity to our customers and partners, as well as how specific solutions that were implemented to protect against such attacks are performing. We undergo SSAE 18 reviews annually, and many of our major customers routinely audit our security controls. We conduct an annual Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliance program and remain PCI certified. We regularly engage independent third-party organizations to evaluate TransUnion’s security program via testing and assessments. Additionally, we hire third parties to conduct independent information security assessments.
Intellectual Property and Licensing Agreements
Our intellectual property is a strategic advantage and protecting it is critical to our business. Because of the importance of our intellectual property, we treat our brand, software, technology, know-how, concepts and databases as proprietary. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights under the trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, as well as through the use of licenses and contractual agreements, such as nondisclosure agreements. While we hold various patents, we do not rely primarily on patents to protect our core intellectual property. Through contractual arrangements, disclosure controls and continual associate training programs, our principal focus is to treat our key proprietary information and databases as trade secrets. Also, we have registered certain trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, internet URLs and other marks of distinction in the United States and foreign countries, the most important of which is the trademark TransUnion name and logo. This trademark is used in connection with most of the services we sell and we believe it is a known mark in the industry.
We own proprietary software that we use to maintain our databases and to develop and deliver our services. We develop and maintain business-critical software that transforms data furnished by various sources into databases upon which our services are 
built. We also develop and maintain software to manage our consumer interactions, including providing disclosures and resolving disputes. In all business segments, we develop and maintain software applications that we use to deliver services to our customers, through a software-as-a-service model. In particular, we develop and maintain analytics and technology solutions infrastructure that we host and make available for our customers to develop and deploy analytics to improve business performance.
We license certain data and other intellectual property to other companies on arms-length terms that are designed to protect our rights to our intellectual property. We generally use standard licensing agreements and do not provide our intellectual property to third parties without a nondisclosure and license agreement in place.
We also license certain intellectual property that is important for our business from third parties. For example, we license credit-scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a top priority. We are subject to numerous laws governing the collection, protection, dissemination and use of non-public personal information, credit information and other types of information. These laws are enforced by U.S. federal, state and local regulatory agencies, foreign regulatory authorities and, in some instances, through private civil litigation. Our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition or overall operations.
We proactively manage our compliance with laws and regulations through a global legal, risk and compliance department that ensures enterprise standards are followed. Through the legal, risk and compliance functions, we provide training to our associates, monitor all material laws and regulations, establish compliance policies, routinely review internal processes to determine whether business practice changes are warranted, assist in the development of new products and services, and regularly meet with principal regulators and legislators to ensure transparent engagement regarding our operations.
U.S. Data and Privacy Protection
Our U.S. operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing privacy, data security, consumer protection and the use of consumer credit information. Certain of these laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized release of, or access to, this protected information. The laws and regulations that affect our U.S. business include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”): FCRA applies to consumer credit reporting agencies, including us, as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports. FCRA promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. FCRA limits what information may be reported by consumer reporting agencies, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports, establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, includes provisions designed to prevent identity theft and assist fraud victims, requires consumer reporting agencies to make a free annual credit report available to consumers and imposes many other requirements on consumer reporting agencies, data furnishers and users of consumer report information. Violation of FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. Regulatory enforcement of FCRA is under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another.
•The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”): The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct, or prior published regulatory guidance or judicial interpretation has found the activity to be in accordance with law.
•The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”): The EGRRCPA amended certain parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, FCRA and other U.S. federal laws applicable to us. Among other things, the EGRRCPA requires that credit reporting agencies provide consumers with at least one year to submit a fraud alert, establishes a national security freeze that prevents credit reporting agencies from disclosing the content of a consumer report and must be provided free of charge upon formal request, and mandates that credit reporting agencies notify consumers of their right to a credit freeze and provide instructions on how to implement and lift a freeze. The EGRRCPA also requires credit reporting agencies to provide additional credit protections and services to veterans and active duty U.S. military consumers.
•State unfair and deceptive practices acts and practices laws:  Many states have enacted statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, relating to, among other things, marketing, disclosures and billing practices within the state or directed to consumers within the state. The Company and others in the industry may be subject to these laws with respect to the marketing of consumer credit information products.
•Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (the “GLBA”): The GLBA regulates, among other things, the receipt, use and disclosure of non-public personal information of consumers held by financial institutions, including us. Several of our datasets are subject to GLBA provisions, including limitations on the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the technological, physical and administrative safeguarding of non-public personal information. Violation of the GLBA can result in civil and criminal liability. 
•Drivers’ Privacy Protection Act (the “DPPA”):  The DPPA requires all states to safeguard certain personal information included in licensed drivers’ motor vehicle records from improper use or disclosure. The DPPA limits the use of this information sourced from State departments of motor vehicles to certain specified purposes, and does not apply if a driver has consented to the release of their data. The DPPA imposes criminal fines for non-compliance and grants individuals a private right of action, including actual and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. The DPPA provides a federal baseline of protections for individuals, and is only partially preemptive, meaning that except in a few narrow circumstances, state legislatures may pass laws to supplement the protections made by the DPPA. Many states’ laws are more restrictive than the federal law.
•Data security breach laws:  All states and some territories have adopted data security breach laws that may require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the GLBA data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws, including regulatory investigations or enforcement actions from state attorneys general, who enforce state data breach or unfair and deceptive practices laws.
•Identity theft laws: Under the federal EGRRCPA, consumers can place a security freeze on their credit reports o and obtain one-year of fraud alerts free of charge. In addition, all states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit report. Generally, these state laws require us to respond to requests for a freeze within a certain period of time, to send certain notices or confirmations to consumers in connection with a security freeze and to unfreeze files upon request within a specified time period.
•Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”):  The FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. We must comply with the FTC Act when we market our services, such as consumer credit monitoring services. Our data collection, use and disclosure practices and the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the FTC Act, and our data practices or our failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action. 
•The Credit Repair Organizations Act (“CROA”):  CROA regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. Some courts have applied CROA to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others. CROA allows for a private right of action and permits consumers to recover all money paid for alleged “credit repair” services in the event of violation.
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”):  HIPAA and HITECH require companies to implement reasonable safeguards to prevent intentional or unintentional misuse or wrongful disclosure of protected health information. We obtain protected health information from healthcare providers and payors of healthcare claims under a “business associate” agreement that is subject to the privacy, security and transactional requirements imposed by HIPAA and HITECH. As a business associate, we are obligated to limit our use and disclosure of health-related data to certain statutorily permitted purposes, HIPAA regulations, as outlined in our business associate agreements, and to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data. HIPAA and HITECH also require, in certain circumstances, the reporting of breaches of protected health information to affected individuals and to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A violation of any of the terms of a business associate agreement or noncompliance with HIPAA or HITECH data privacy or security requirements could result in administrative enforcement action and/or imposition of statutory penalties by the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a state attorney general. HIPAA and HITECH requirements supplement but do not preempt state laws regulating the use and disclosure of health-related information; state law remedies, which can include a private right of action, remain available to individuals affected by an impermissible use or disclosure of health-related data.
•California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) and the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”): The CCPA gives California consumers certain rights regarding the collection and disclosure of their personal information and requires businesses to make certain disclosures and take certain other acts in furtherance of those rights. The CCPA exempts much of the data whose use is covered by FCRA, GLBA, HIPAA and DPPA and therefore much of our data is not subject to the CCPA. The CCPA creates a private right of action for security breaches. In 2020, California adopted the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which amends and expands CCPA. Most of the substantive provisions of CPRA will go into effect in 2023. Two additional 
comprehensive state privacy laws, the VCDPA and the CPA, which apply to Virginia and Colorado consumers, respectively, will go into effect in 2023. These laws are similar to the CCPA, but provide additional rights and restrictions, such as the right to correction and restrictions on the use of sensitive personal information.
•Requirements for Government Contractors: Special requirements may apply to TransUnion when providing services to U.S. federal, state and local government agencies. For example and without limitation, TransUnion may need to abide by the Privacy Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Service’s Publication 4812, and various Federal Acquisition Regulation and associated supplemental contract clauses. Each of these laws, regulations and contract clauses dictates particular measures for the protection of personal information or information that is otherwise categorized as sensitive by the government. Government agencies frequently modify or supplement these requirements, and consequences for violations of applicable requirements may include penalties, civil liability and for severe infractions, criminal liability.
We are also subject to U.S. federal and state laws that are generally applicable to any U.S. business with national or international operations, such as antitrust laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and various employment laws. We continuously monitor U.S. federal and state legislative and regulatory activities that involve credit reporting, data privacy and security, and other relevant subjects to identify issues in order to remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
International Data and Privacy Protection
We are subject to data protection, privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Canada: The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) and substantially similar provincial laws govern how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. The PIPEDA gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by such organizations. The PIPEDA requires compliance with the Canadian Standard Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. Most Canadian provinces also have laws dealing with consumer reporting. These laws typically impose an obligation on credit reporting agencies to have reasonable processes in place to maintain the accuracy of the information, place limits on the disclosure of the information and give consumers the right to have access to, and challenge the accuracy of, the information.
•Colombia: The Colombian Financial Data Protection Regime (Law 1266 of 2008) regulates the collection, use and transfer of personal data pertaining to financial services, including credit reporting. The Colombian General Data Protection Regime (Law 1581 of 2012 and Decree 1377 of 2013) covers regulation of all other personal data. Both of these regimes have applicability to credit reporting services in Colombia and together address obligations of information furnishers, database owners, consumer right of access, consumer consent and permitted information disclosures. 
•European Union: Our data management activities and the commercial solutions we make available to the European market are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This law establishes significant data protection and privacy standards that empower European Union consumers to exercise significant control over their personal data. In addition to a litany of substantive provisions empowering consumers to limit how data may be used, GDPR also imposes operational, data processing, and other technical requirements with which we must comply. Failure to comply with any provision of GDPR could result in significant regulatory or other enforcement penalties.
•United Kingdom: Our UK operations are subject to GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation (the “PECR”), which together govern the processing of personal data pertaining to UK citizens. Enforcement of data regulation and consumer privacy matters in the UK resides with the Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent body set up to uphold the rights of individuals in relation to the use of their personal data. The provision of credit referencing services in the UK is also a regulated activity that is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). The FCA has regulated credit reference agencies since 2014 with the objectives of protecting consumers, protecting financial markets and promoting competition. TransUnion UK (previously Callcredit), Experian and Equifax were granted full FCA authorization in early 2016 and are therefore all required to follow the rules and principles issued by the FCA. 
In 2018, the FCA introduced Open Banking which aims to improve customer experience and to increase competition in the banking sector. Consumers can share transaction data with third parties via application program interfaces (“APIs”) to identify best products and take up multi-bank products. As part of Open Banking, the Second Payment Services Directive allows merchants to retrieve a customer’s account data from their bank with their consent. The implementation of Open Banking platforms has increased the number of payment service providers available to consumers beyond traditional banks. TransUnion UK is an authorized information services provider under this regime.
•South Africa: The National Credit Act of 2005 (the “NCA”) and its implementing regulations govern credit bureaus and consumer credit information. The NCA sets standards for filing, retaining and reporting consumer credit 
information. The NCA also defines consumers’ rights with respect to accessing their own information and addresses the process for disputing information in a credit file. The NCA is enforced by The National Credit Regulator who has authority to supervise and examine credit bureaus. In addition, the Protection of Personal Information Act (“POPIA”), went into effect on July 1, 2020, with enforcement commencing on July 1, 2021. POPIA regulates the processing of personal information of legal and juristic persons, and imposes compliance obligations and sanctions.
•India: The Credit Information Companies Regulation Act of 2005 (“CICRA”) requires entities that collect and maintain personal credit information to ensure that it is complete, accurate and protected. Entities must adopt certain privacy principles in relation to collecting, processing, preserving, sharing and using credit information. Data protection is currently covered under provisions of the Information Technology Act of 2000 as well as regulations promulgated by the Reserve Bank of India. In addition, India has pending privacy legislation that proposes to cover personal and non-personal data and provides for penalties to be paid to the government, compensation to individuals, as well as criminal liability in certain cases.
•Hong Kong: Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (“PDPO”) and The Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data regulate the operation of consumer credit reference agencies. They prescribe the methods and security controls under which credit providers and credit reference agencies may collect, access and manage credit data. The PDPO was amended in 2021 to provide new powers to the Privacy Commissioner and to make criminal the act of publicly releasing information identifying an individual or organization – a practice known as “doxxing.” 
•Brazil: The Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”), went into effect on September 18, 2020. LGPD regulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance obligations and sanctions comparable to those of GDPR. The sanctions provisions of the LGPD went into effect on August 1, 2021.
Other International Laws
Credit information and credit information companies have also become subject to, directly or indirectly, further governance regulations, such as those historically reserved for banks. We are also subject to various laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses in the other countries where we operate.
Sustainability 
We are dedicated to making meaningful, positive contributions to the world and the communities we serve. We are making an impact through our commitments to advancing underrepresented people, enabling life-changing access to credit in mature and emerging markets, and using trended data to help consumers improve their access to credit. 
We focus our environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) efforts on issues that are important to our business and to our key stakeholders. In 2021, we conducted our first global ESG materiality assessment, which confirmed the importance of cybersecurity, privacy, and corporate governance to the continued success of our business. The assessment also confirmed the importance of TransUnion continuing to focus efforts on enhancing financial inclusion, employee wellness, diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”), and climate change.
Climate Change
Climate change continues to be a key issue for companies worldwide. In 2021, in partnership with an external consultant, we completed a survey of our greenhouse gas emissions and designed new climate change commitments. We set two climate change targets: reaching net zero scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025; and 30 percent reductions on leased real estate scope 3 emissions by 2030, using a 2019 baseline. We plan to achieve these reduction targets through renewable energy purchases, an environmentally-friendly cloud migration, and our real estate consolidation strategy. For emissions that TransUnion is unable to reasonably avoid, we expect to mitigate our impact through annual offset purchases until we reach our target. 
Human Capital Management
We employed approximately 10,200 employees at December 31, 2021. Central to our long-term strategy is attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally with the right skills to drive our success. Our board of directors receives regular updates on human capital topics such as sustainability, employee retention, engagement and survey results, enterprise compliance, investigations and associate health and safety.
Other than certain employees in Brazil, none of our employees is currently represented by a labor union or has terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages.
Diversity Strategy
We see diversity as a source of strength and know that it is essential to our mission, innovation and growth. At TransUnion, we know that diversity helps us win. We have a three-pronged approach to our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy consisting of the following:
•Hire: We seek to expand the diversity of our talent pool through a dedicated diversity recruiter, targeted sourcing methods and job postings. 
•Develop: We cultivate diverse talent internally through development plans and customized programming for underrepresented groups.
•Promote: We continue to expand our rigorous pay and promotion practices designed to remove bias, including ongoing pay equity analysis and compensation review, and development opportunities designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all employees.
We believe that a critical component of continuing to deliver innovative products to consumers and customers is maintaining diverse and inclusive teams. Detailed below is our progress in advancing diversity in our leadership and associate population in alignment with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting standards. Select workforce diversity statistics for 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:

The employee population from our Healthcare business, which we divested on December 17, 2021, is included in 2019 and 2020 data, but excluded from 2021 data.
Talent Acquisition and Retention
Our talent acquisition and retention strategy is multi-faceted. We aim to recruit the most qualified candidates, and strive for a diverse and well-balanced workforce.
We reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits, and perquisite programs that allow employees and their families to thrive. Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce tailored to the variety of businesses and geographies in which we operate. 
We continue to support our employees and their families, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes child care benefits that provide access to onsite or community centers, enhanced back-up care choices that include personal caregivers, child care referral assistance and child care provider discounts, help with homework and a variety of parenting educational resources. We also provide our employees with access to free mental and behavioral health resources, including on-
demand access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents. We continue to look for new ways to support our employees and their families through the pandemic.
Employee Engagement, Training and Development
We prioritize and invest in helping our employees grow and build their careers through several training and development programs. These include online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats as well as executive talent and succession planning paired with an individualized development approach.
Safety and Wellness
We have heightened our focus on the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. We quickly and effectively moved to a work-from-home model in the early days of the pandemic in every market we serve, and continue to generally adhere to that model. This has allowed us to protect our associates and the broader population while continuing to operate our businesses and provide services and solutions to customers and consumers. In addition, we have taken several actions to support those who are financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the locations where we operate.
