Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics intended to address significant unmet medical needs in important acute care markets. Our development programs are primarily focused in the treatment of acute cardiovascular and secondarily in acute pulmonary diseases. Our lead product candidate, istaroxime, is a first-in-class, dual-acting agent being developed to improve cardiac function in patients with acute heart failure, or AHF, with a potentially differentiated safety profile from existing treatments. Istaroxime demonstrated significant improvement in both diastolic and systolic aspects of cardiac function and was generally well tolerated in two phase 2 clinical trials. Istaroxime has been granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of AHF by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Based on the profile observed in our phase 2 clinical studies in AHF, where istaroxime significantly improved cardiac function and systolic blood pressure in acute decompensated heart failure patients, we initiated a phase 2 global clinical study to evaluate istaroxime for the treatment of early cardiogenic shock (Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Stage B shock), a severe form of heart failure characterized by very low blood pressure and risk for hypoperfusion to critical organs. We believe that istaroxime has the potential to fulfill an unmet need in early cardiogenic shock. Our heart failure cardiovascular portfolio also includes sarco endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase 2a, or SERCA2a, activators which activate SERCA2a. This research program is evaluating these preclinical product candidates, including oral and intravenous SERCA2a activator heart failure compounds. As potential oral agents, these candidates would be developed for chronic heart failure. In addition, our cardiovascular drug product candidates include rostafuroxin, a novel product candidate for the treatment of hypertension in patients with a specific genetic profile. We are pursuing potential licensing arrangements and/or other strategic partnerships and do not intend to advance this product candidate without securing such an arrangement or partnership.
 
Our pulmonary product candidate portfolio consists of a KL4 surfactant platform to address a range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. KL4 surfactant has been in development as a liquid instillate for noninvasive delivery as an aerosol. In September 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug, or IND, application for an open-label phase 2 pilot study to assess safety and tolerability in the COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, population and the ability of our KL4 surfactant liquid instillate to impact key respiratory parameters in the treatment of lung injury and ARDS resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent in novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, infections. In January 2022, we completed enrollment of 20 patients in our phase 2 study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury. The study demonstrated that intratracheal administration of reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant was generally safe and well tolerated. Lucinactant was safely administered to critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS. Oxygenation and other physiological parameters were stable to improved after dosing, supporting the feasibility of this treatment approach to develop a potential treatment for critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes.
 
Previously, we were also developing AEROSURF (lucinactant for inhalation), a novel drug/medical device combination product for noninvasive delivery of aerosolized KL4 surfactant using our ADS technology for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS, in premature infants. We suspended all internal AEROSURF clinical activities in November 2020, because istaroxime, our lead product candidate, has become our primary focus for investment and execution as we believe development of istaroxime represents a greater value opportunity for us and our stockholders than development of KL4 surfactant. Since completing our phase 2 study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury in January 2022, in order to preserve resources for the highest priority programs, we have begun to reduce costs that were not already transferred to our licensee in Asia, Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Ltd., or Lee’s (HK), under the terms of our License, Development and Commercialization Agreement between us and Lee’s (HK) dated as of June 12, 2017, as amended, or the Asia License Agreement. These costs include certain reductions in headcount dedicated to KL4 surfactant and the decommissioning of both our analytical and technical support laboratory, which previously conducted release testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and supportive research for our lyophilized and aerosolized KL4 surfactant, and our medical device development laboratory, which was previously used to conduct development activities and testing for our ADS technologies. To support the future development of our KL4 surfactant platform in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S., we are pursuing one or more licensing transactions.
 
Our ability to advance our development programs is dependent upon our ability to secure additional capital in both the near and long-term, through public or private equity offerings; through potential strategic opportunities, including licensing agreements, drug product development and marketing collaboration arrangements, pharmaceutical research cooperation arrangements or other similar transactions in geographic markets, including the U.S., and/or through potential grants and other funding commitments from U.S. government agencies, in each case, if available. We have engaged with potential counterparties in various markets and will continue to pursue non-dilutive sources of capital as well as potential private and public offerings. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify and enter into public or private securities offerings on acceptable terms and in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or qualify for non-dilutive funding opportunities under any grant programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies, private foundations and/or leading academic institutions, or identify and enter into any strategic transactions that will provide the additional capital that we will require. If none of these alternatives is available, or if available, we are unable to raise sufficient capital through such transactions, we potentially could be forced to limit or cease our development activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Development Programs
 
The table below summarizes the current status and anticipated milestones for our principal product development programs. However, due to the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the U.S. and globally, and its effect on hospital resources, focus, availability of services, and professional staff, our clinical trials and the next expected milestones of our product candidates may be impacted, and we may experience delays in anticipated timelines and milestones. In addition, these timelines are dependent on our ability to secure sufficient capital to continue development without interruption.

Cardiovascular Programs
 
Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which patients often experience episodic periods of increased symptoms known as AHF, where the heart fails to adequately pump, resulting in worsening symptoms, including pulmonary and peripheral edema and other severe complications. In the U.S., approximately 6 million people (nearly 2% of the adult population) have heart failure and approximately half of these patients are expected to die within five years of diagnosis; and in the combined U.S., EU and Japan markets, there are more than 18 million patients suffering from heart failure. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients age 65 years and older. AHF can be precipitated by many factors and puts patients at increased risk for morbidity, hospital readmission and mortality. There are more than 1.3 million hospital admissions for heart failure in the U.S. each year and over 2.5 million hospital estimated admissions for AHF in the combined U.S., EU and Japan markets. We estimate that AHF may represent a potential combined annual addressable market (U.S., EU and Japan) of approximately two million patients with multi-billion-dollar annual market value.
Istaroxime (Early Cardiogenic Shock)
 
We are evaluating istaroxime for the treatment of early cardiogenic shock, a severe presentation of heart failure characterized by very low blood pressure and risk for hypoperfusion to critical organs which is associated with high mortality and morbidity and is not well treated with current therapies. In September 2020, we initiated a small phase 2 clinical study of istaroxime for the acute treatment of early cardiogenic shock in heart failure patients with a more severe case of heart failure to evaluate the potential to improve blood pressure. The study also will evaluate the safety and side effect profile of istaroxime in this patient population. We expect data to be available in April 2022. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive effect on hospital resources (including in intensive care units, or ICUs) where this study is being conducted. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the severity of illness of patients presenting with early cardiogenic shock and/or conditions that could lead to early cardiogenic shock. In addition, the geographic mix of patients can impact the outcome of a clinical trial, and with the global spread of COVID-19 occurring in waves, the mix of patients across countries has fluctuated. How these dynamics could potentially impact both timelines and outcomes is unknown.
 
We believe istaroxime may fulfill an unmet need in early cardiogenic shock based on the profile observed in our phase 2 clinical studies in AHF, which demonstrated that istaroxime significantly improved cardiac function and systolic blood pressure. There is significant unmet medical need in the area of early cardiogenic shock and severe heart failure. If istaroxime is able to demonstrate a meaningful improvement in blood pressure in clinical trials of this condition, we believe there may be an opportunity to apply for a Breakthrough Therapy designation that could provide beneficial opportunities for the development program. We note that regulatory precedent exists for an approval in shock (distributive) based primarily upon improvements in blood pressure with an acceptable safety profile. We will be exploring the potential for this type of pathway for istaroxime. In addition, we believe the receipt of either Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation may increase the likelihood of receiving priority review of a marketing application, which would provide for an expedited review timeframe; however, there is no guarantee that we would receive Breakthrough Therapy or Fast Track designation or that any such designation will lead to a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures.
 
Using cardiogenic shock patient U.S. hospital claims and worldwide prevalence data, we estimate the worldwide total market value of cardiogenic shock to be $1.25 billion. This estimate is calculated by multiplying the patient numbers from the largest markets, by the assumed various regional prices of drug treatment in the acute care market. The addressable market for istaroxime will be a subset of the total market value of $1.25 billion.

Istaroxime (AHF)
 
Istaroxime is a first-in-class, dual action investigational drug that we are developing to treat AHF with a potentially differentiated safety profile from current AHF therapies. In 2019, we announced topline results of a successful phase 2b clinical trial of istaroxime in which the primary endpoint of cardiac function, E/e’ ratio (echocardiographic assessment reflecting changes in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or PCWP, or left ventricular filing pressure) as well as other important parameters were significantly improved. Istaroxime has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of AHF. In April 2020, we announced the presentation at the American College of Cardiology 2020 virtual meeting of a new subset analysis from a phase 2b study of istaroxime in patients hospitalized with AHF. This post-hoc analysis characterized the responses between Caucasian and Asian patients and demonstrated that the istaroxime dose of 0.5 µg/kg/min produced a similar response on E/e’, the primary study endpoint, and stroke volume index, an important measure of cardiac performance.
 
Istaroxime represents a novel approach to the treatment of AHF. It has a dual mechanism of action to improve cardiovascular physiology. Current therapy for heart failure in the hospital typically includes intravenous diuretics and, if the blood pressure is low, supportive therapy with inotropes. Inotropes are often associated with adverse effects such as hypotension, arrhythmias and, in some cases, increased mortality. These drugs are used only if needed to support blood pressure and cardiac function. We believe that istaroxime, if approved, may have the potential to address unmet medical needs of these patients by improving cardiac function and management of fluid accumulation that contributes to heart failure symptoms with a potentially differentiated safety profile from current AHF therapies, including a potential reduction in complications and improvement of other clinical outcomes.
 
To advance istaroxime for the treatment of AHF potentially through the phase 2 clinical program and be in a phase 3-ready position, our strategy includes, subject to adequate resources, planning an additional phase 2 clinical trial that will enroll approximately 300 patients in approximately 60 clinical sites globally. This trial will focus on treating heart failure patients with low blood pressure, who also tend to be diuretic resistant, as a patient population that we believe could particularly benefit from the unique profile and potential ability of istaroxime to increase cardiac function and increase blood pressure while maintaining or improving renal function.
 
This trial will also collect data on measures that may serve as primary endpoints in a phase 3 clinical trial, and will include an optimized dosing regimen, potentially extending the infusion time beyond 24 hours. We currently do not have sufficient capital to execute this clinical trial. We are exploring capital from public and private equity offerings and potential strategic opportunities to fund the initiation of this clinical trial, and plan to initiate the clinical trial after obtaining adequate funding. We plan to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on hospital resources and resulting potential changes in regulatory timelines for conducting non-COVID-19-related clinical trials.
 
Rostafuroxin
 
Rostafuroxin is a novel investigational drug product candidate being developed for the treatment of hypertension in patients with a specific genetic profile, which is found in approximately 20% - 25% of the adult hypertensive population. Rostafuroxin has been studied in three phase 2 clinical trials assessing reduction in blood pressure in a hypertensive population selected in accordance with the specified genetic profile. After positive phase 2a results, a phase 2b study was initiated. In this most recent phase 2b clinical trial, rostafuroxin demonstrated efficacy in Caucasian patients in treatment naïve hypertension. During the second quarter of 2021, we concluded an initial process to test the industry’s interest in investing in our drug product candidate. We currently have not been able to secure a licensing transaction or other strategic opportunity. As a result, we recorded an impairment of the related intangible asset (see, Note 4 – Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements – Goodwill and Intangible Assets). Based on feedback received from potential licensing partners, we have determined that there is a need for an additional phase 2 clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy in non-Caucasian and Caucasian patients in treatment resistant hypertension. We are continuing to pursue licensing arrangements and/or other strategic partnerships for rostafuroxin. We do not intend to conduct the additional phase 2 clinical trial without securing such an arrangement or partnership.
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, patients with high blood pressure have a greater risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the U.S. Nearly half of adults in the U.S. (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or are taking medication for hypertension. In 2018, nearly half a million deaths in the U.S. included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. Only about 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control. Patients often have persistent hypertension despite being on multiple therapies. Ethnicity and genetic makeup are known to impact the response to anti-hypertensive treatments, and uncontrolled hypertension has been associated with certain genetic makeups. Given the size of the market and the prevalence of unmet medical needs, major pharmaceutical companies have maintained hypertension as a key area of focus and continue to seek new drugs to compete in markets they have established with previous anti-hypertensive therapies.
 
SERCA2a Activators – Preclinical Oral, Chronic and Acute Heart Failure Product Candidates
 
We are pursuing several early exploratory research programs to assess potential product candidates, including oral and intravenous SERCA2a activator heart failure compounds, and believe that we can add value to our cardiovascular portfolio by advancing these SERCA2a activator candidates through preclinical studies. To further advance these product candidates, we are actively exploring potential licensing transactions, research partnership arrangements or other strategic opportunities.
Pulmonary Programs
 
Lyophilized KL4 Surfactant (COVID-19 related Lung Injury)
 
Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may progress to severe respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. This acute lung injury, known as ARDS, has no approved therapies and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare resource utilization. The COVID-19 virus infects via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, or ACE2, on surfactant producing cells in the lung. The ACE2 receptor is found on alveolar Type 2 cells in the lung. Type 2 cells are the source of pulmonary surfactant production. When these cells are infected and damaged, surfactant production is impaired, increasing the risk for respiratory failure as surfactant is necessary for the lungs to stay inflated and for proper gas exchange. Surfactant deficiency is known to contribute to the pathophysiology of ARDS, respiratory failure, and lung injury in patients on mechanical ventilation.
 
    3 

  

In January 2022, we completed enrollment of 20 patients in our study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury. The phase 2 trial was designed to assess feasibility, safety, and tolerability of administration of reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant in these critically ill patients. The multicenter, single-arm study enrolled 20 critically ill patients who were intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe COVID-19 associated ARDS. Patients received lucinactant as a liquid via the endotracheal tube assessing safety and tolerability of the administration procedure and of the drug. Oxygenation and other physiological responses were also measured. Study sites were in the U.S. and Argentina.
 
The study demonstrated that intratracheal administration of reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant was generally safe and well tolerated. Lucinactant was safely administered to critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS. Oxygenation and other physiological parameters were stable to improved after dosing, supporting the feasibility of this treatment approach to develop a potential treatment for critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes.
 
AEROSURF (lucinactant for inhalation)
 
AEROSURF is an investigational combination drug/medical device product to improve the management of RDS in premature infants. RDS is a condition that occurs in premature infants who may not have fully developed natural lung surfactant, which is essential to normal respiratory function and survival, and may require surfactant therapy to sustain life, and can result in long-term respiratory problems, developmental delays and death. Surfactant therapy is the primary therapy to address an underlying surfactant deficiency, and AEROSURF is designed to deliver aerosolized KL4 surfactant noninvasively using our proprietary ADS technology. We have completed three AEROSURF phase 2 clinical trials. Our most recent phase 2b clinical trial did not achieve its primary endpoint, due primarily, we believe, to an unexpected rate of treatment interruptions associated with the prototype phase 2 ADS used in the phase 2b clinical trial, or phase 2 ADS. After excluding patients whose doses were interrupted, in accordance with the predesignated statistical plan, we observed a meaningful treatment effect in line with our desired targeted outcome and believe that these results support the further development of AEROSURF to reduce both the rate of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or nCPAP, failure and the need for intubation in premature infants being treated for RDS. AEROSURF has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of RDS.
 
In August 2020, we entered into a Project Financing Agreement with Lee’s (HK), or the PF Agreement, dated and effective as of August 12, 2020, under which we received payments totaling $2.8 million through October 2020. Pursuant to the PF Agreement, Lee’s (HK) agreed to pay additional amounts to be set forth in an updated development budget to be agreed between the parties by September 1, 2020 and updated every six months thereafter, to fund the continued development of AEROSURF and to be paid with the payment schedule to be set forth in each updated development budget. In partial satisfaction of our obligations under the PF Agreement, we agreed to pay Lee’s (HK) 50% of any Commercialization Net Revenues (as defined in the PF Agreement) up to an amount that is equal to 125% of the Project Expenses (as defined in the PF Agreement) funded by Lee’s (HK). On November 12, 2020, Lee’s (HK) provided notice of termination of additional funding under the PF Agreement, and we and Lee’s (HK) revised our plans for the continued development of AEROSURF. Lee’s (HK) agreed to continue the development of AEROSURF in Asia at its own cost. Lee’s (HK) agreed to fund an additional $1.0 million to us in 2021 for certain transition and analytical services to be provided by us with respect to the development of AEROSURF, which will be considered “Project Expenses” under the terms of the PF Agreement. In 2021, we received payments totaling $1.0 million from Lee’s (HK) and no further amounts are due under the PF Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
 
With the termination of the PF Agreement in November 2020, we ceased enrollment in our phase 2b bridging study at the European Union, or EU, clinical sites and are transferring AEROSURF development activities to Lee’s (HK) to be implemented under the terms of our Asia License Agreement. Since the 2018 acquisition of CVie Investments Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary CVie Therapeutics Limited, istaroxime has become our primary focus for investment and execution due to what we believe represents a greater potential value opportunity for us and our stockholders. Since completing our phase 2 study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury in January 2022, in order to preserve resources for the highest priority programs, we have begun to reduce costs not already transferred to our licensee in Asia, Lee’s (HK), under the terms of our Asia License Agreement. These costs include certain reductions in headcount dedicated to KL4 surfactant and the decommissioning of both our analytical and technical support laboratory, which previously conducted release testing of APIs and supportive research for our lyophilized and aerosolized KL4 surfactant, and our medical device development laboratory, which was previously used to conduct development activities and testing for our ADS technologies. To support the future development of our KL4 surfactant platform in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S., we are pursuing one or more licensing transactions.
 
Lyophilized KL4 Surfactant (Lung Injury and Other Studies)
 
We believe our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and ADS technologies may potentially support a product pipeline to address a range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. We have from time to time worked with independent investigators and pharmaceutical companies to conduct or assist with preclinical studies, some of which were funded under grants from National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and other government agencies, to assess the utility of using our KL4 surfactant, alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical compounds, to address various respiratory conditions.

Impact of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to closely monitor its impact on our business and operations, including its continued impact on our clinical development plans and timelines, and financial condition. There has been intermittent impact of the pandemic in differing geographies, and there may be continued impact, particularly in light of the surge of new COVID-19 cases relating to new variants, such as the delta and omicron variants. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our operations, capital and financial resources and overall liquidity position and outlook have been impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to delays experienced in our operations, including in clinical study initiation and enrollment. The extended timelines have required us to expend more of our capital resources than planned to achieve our projected milestones. For example, our phase 2 study of istaroxime for early cardiogenic shock in heart failure patients experienced delays in trial initiation and enrollment in 2020 and 2021. The full extent, duration, or impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have, directly or indirectly, on our financial condition and operations, including ongoing and planned clinical trials, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These potential future developments include new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the severity and transmissibility of new variants of the virus, information about any resurgences in one or more geographic locations where our current or intended clinical trial sites, our principal executive offices, research and development laboratories or manufacturing facilities are located, and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, which may include, among others, the timing and extent of government reopening activities and the economic impact on local, regional, national, and international markets. In addition, regional impact and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected where a clinical trial could be executed and how various elements of the clinical trial are performed. Going forward, the pandemic could also impact how monitoring/auditing of clinical trial sites and data occur. The maintenance, or strategic re-implementation, of mitigating COVID-19 measures in one or more geographic locations where our clinical trial sites, principal executive offices, research and development laboratories or other facilities are located remains possible and if realized, we believe there could be further impact on the clinical development of our product candidates, which may include potential delays, halts or modifications to our ongoing and planned trials in 2022 and beyond.
 
Our Strategy
 
We intend to maximize the value of our product candidates and proprietary technologies. Our strategy to achieve this goal includes plans to:
 

● | Study istaroxime for early cardiogenic shock and, if the drug demonstrates adequate potential to raise blood pressure with an acceptable safety profile, pursue opportunity for an indication, which we believe may include a Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA, and if available, an expedited regulatory pathway to address this area of unmet medical need. In March 2022, we completed a 60-patient phase 2a clinical trial in early cardiogenic shock, with topline data expected in April 2022;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance istaroxime for the treatment of AHF to a phase 3-ready position and potential partnering, collaboration or other strategic transaction. We have begun start-up activities for an additional phase 2b clinical trial in approximately 300 patients and plan to execute the clinical trial after obtaining adequate funding;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance development of chronic and acute preclinical heart failure programs. To create added value for our cardiovascular portfolio, we plan to advance oral (chronic) and intravenous (acute) SERCA2a activator product candidates through selected preclinical studies to demonstrate proof of concept; actively exploring potential licensing transactions, research partnership arrangements and other strategic opportunities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue non-dilutive funding and partnership support of a clinical trial meant to enhance the potential clinical positioning of rostafuroxin by examining its potential in the treatment resistant hypertension patient population. Our primary objective for rostafuroxin is to identify out-licensing or other strategic arrangements for the completion of development and potential commercialization with one or more larger companies that have an interest in and/or operate in the very large and broad anti-hypertension market, and thereafter, to reinvest any proceeds to provide for our other core priority programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to support Lee’s (HK) in its development of the KL4 platform in Asia. To support the future global development of our KL4 surfactant platform, including development in RDS via aerosolized AEROSURF and/or instillate delivery and/or in other potential applications such as acute lung injury, in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S., we are pursuing one or more licensing transactions; and 


● | To enhance our product portfolio and leverage our depth of experience in late-stage clinical development and commercialization, we plan to pursue a focused business development agenda directed towards enhancing our current offerings and identifying additional product candidates that enhance our portfolio and provide more opportunity to grow value and diversify risk. The strategic focus is on areas that fit our market focus (specialty critical, acute care and/or orphan designation), fit our scale for development and cost structure and leverage our therapeutic area and other competencies such as clinical-stage development.

Our Product Candidates
 
Istaroxime
 
Our lead cardiovascular product candidate is istaroxime, a novel, first-in-class, dual action investigational drug that we are developing to treat AHF and early cardiogenic shock. Istaroxime has been evaluated in two phase 2 clinical trials, the results of which suggest that istaroxime may improve cardiovascular physiological function as assessed by parameters of pump function, decreases in heart rate, increases in blood pressure and renal function (as measured by filtration rate) without adverse events such as arrhythmias or cardiac damage (as indicated by elevated troponin values). In August 2019, the FDA granted us Fast Track designation for istaroxime for the treatment of AHF.

AHF and Early Cardiogenic Shock Overview
 
Heart failure can result from structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Heart failure is a chronic, progressive disease that commonly but episodically worsens to a point of critical decompensation, where cardiac output fails to meet the body’s metabolic needs. The disease is characterized by inadequate pumping function of the heart that results in fluid accumulation manifesting as pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema and congestion in other parts of the body. Insufficient cardiac output can result in inadequate peripheral perfusion that increases the risk of other organ dysfunction such as renal failure. Chronic heart failure is commonly treated with multiple medications including diuretics, inhibitors of neurohumoral imbalances (angiotensin, renin, aldosterone, naturetic peptides) and beta blockers. Effective treatments for AHF in a hospital setting are lacking.
 
Clinical objectives for AHF patient management include: (i) relieve pulmonary congestion and general edema with intravenous diuretics, (ii) improve cardiac function and peripheral / organ perfusion, (iii) achieve a stable, fully compensated clinical state and, (iv) transition to oral, outpatient medicines (for chronic management of their heart failure). 
 
Current approaches to acutely improve cardiac function are associated with unwanted effects including heart rhythm disturbances, increased heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, decreased blood pressure, potential damage to the heart muscle, worsening renal function and even increases in mortality have been observed. In particular, patients with low systolic blood pressure, or SBP, and peripheral hypoperfusion are high risk, challenging patients and are also generally resistant to diuretic therapy and often discharged in a sub-optimal state.
 
Early cardiogenic shock is a severe presentation of heart failure characterized by very low blood pressure and risk for hypoperfusion to critical organs. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity and is not well treated with current therapies.
 
Method of Action
 
Istaroxime represents a novel approach to the treatment of AHF. It has a dual mechanism of action to improve cardiovascular physiology. First, it activates the SERCA2a calcium pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or SR, leading to enhanced SR calcium uptake and a reduction in cytoplasmic calcium that is thought to improve myocardial relaxation. Second, it inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase activity leading to improved myocardial contractility.
 
  

We believe that these mechanisms of action may result in improvement in cardiac function and perfusion to reduce congestion and edema and preserve other organ function while avoiding the side effects associated with other classes of heart failure therapies. Data from preclinical, phase 2a and phase 2b clinical studies performed to date suggest that istaroxime may improve cardiovascular physiology as assessed by parameters of pump function, decreases in PCWP, decreases in heart rate, increases in blood pressure without an increase in adverse events such as arrhythmias, cardiac damage (as indicated by elevated troponin values) or adverse impact on kidney function. We believe that these features of istaroxime, if approved, could potentially result in clinical improvement of patients' heart failure symptoms, reduce complications and improve other clinical outcomes when compared to current therapeutic regimens for AHF.
 
Clinical Development
 
Early Cardiogenic Shock
 
After assessing the regulatory landscape and data from the istaroxime phase 2 clinical program in AHF and discussions with our scientific advisors, we added to our istaroxime development program a study in early cardiogenic shock due to heart failure. We believe that istaroxime may fulfill an unmet medical need in early cardiogenic shock based on the profile observed in prior phase 2 clinical studies in AHF, in which istaroxime increased SBP, suggesting that istaroxime could potentially contribute to the clinical improvement of select patients in cardiogenic shock due to heart failure.
 
In the second half of 2020, we initiated a small study of istaroxime for the acute treatment of early cardiogenic shock in patients with more severe cases of heart failure, to evaluate the potential to improve blood pressure. This study is a phase 2 international randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of istaroxime in patients with early cardiogenic shock due to heart failure. This study includes 60 patients (30 assigned to istaroxime and 30 assigned to placebo) receiving study drug infusion over 24 hours. The primary endpoint is the change in systolic blood pressure over six hours after initiating the infusion. Secondary endpoints will include characterization of blood pressure changes over 24 hours, the number of patients requiring rescue therapy (vasopressors, inotropes or mechanical devices), assessment of renal function and measures associated with safety and tolerability. The study will also evaluate the safety and side effect profile of istaroxime in this patient population. In March 2022, we completed enrollment of 60 patients and expect data to be available in April 2022. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive effect on hospital resources (including in ICUs) where this study is being conducted. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the severity of illness of patients presenting with early cardiogenic shock and/or conditions that could lead to early cardiogenic shock. In addition, the geographic mix of patients can impact the outcome of a clinical trial, and with the global spread of COVID-19 occurring in waves, the mix of patients across countries has fluctuated. How these dynamics could potentially impact both timelines and outcomes is unknown.

     AHF

Istaroxime has been evaluated in six clinical trials assessing various doses in 280 patients, including two phase 2 clinical trials. In a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial, three doses of istaroxime were evaluated in a study of 120 hospitalized patients (approximately 30 patients per cohort) with AHF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The three doses of istaroxime were administered intravenously over six hours. In this clinical trial, the primary endpoint of lowering of PCWP was significantly improved in all three doses relative to placebo, and certain secondary hemodynamic endpoints (increased systolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate) also improved. The main side effects were vomiting (7.9%) and pain at the infusion site (5.6%); one severe adverse event of ventricular tachycardia was observed. The favorable effects on PCWP, blood pressure and heart rate provided the basis for moving the program forward into a phase clinical 2b trial and for selecting the doses to study.
 
The primary endpoint of the istaroxime phase 2b clinical trial for AHF was a change from baseline to 24 hours after start of infusion (Day 1) in E/e’ with istaroxime 0.5 or 1.0 µg/kg/min compared to placebo. The E/e’ ratio is a marker of the function of the left ventricle, or LV, of the heart and was measured using doppler echocardiography read by a central laboratory. Secondary endpoints included change in other parameters of cardiac function, such as diastolic function, or E/A, stroke volume, or SVI, left ventricle ejection fraction, or LVEF, LV volumes, left atrial, or LA, area, interior vena cava, or IVC, diameter. A 24-hour infusion of istaroxime was associated with significant improvements in cardiac function, in both dosing groups, with a mean E/e' of -4.55 for the 0.5 µg/kg/min group and -3.16 for the 1.0 µg/kg/min group, compared with mean placebo E/e’ ratios of -1.55 and -1.08, respectively. Twenty-four-hour infusions of istaroxime were also associated with substantial increases in stroke volume in both dosing groups, with a mean SVI value of 5.33 ml/beat/m2 for the 0.5 µg/kg/min group and 5.49 ml/beat/m2 for the 1.0 µg/kg/min group, compared with the mean placebo SVI of 1.65 ml/beat/m2 and 3.18 ml/beat/m2, respectively. Importantly, subjects also maintained or increased SBP, with a mean change in SBP of 2.82 mmHg for the 0.5 µg/kg/min group and 6.1 mmHg for the 1.0 µg/kg/min group, compared with the mean placebo SBP values of -2.47 mmHg and 2.7 mmHg, respectively. There were no signs of increased risk for arrhythmias or increased troponin levels (a marker of heart muscle damage) during or after istaroxime infusion. Additionally, blood pressure tended to increase, and heart rate decreased, during the infusion with istaroxime, which may have contributed to the short-term trend toward improvement in renal function. The findings were consistent with the physiologic improvements seen in the phase 2a study and the effects of istaroxime in AHF.
 
 Istaroxime was generally well tolerated. Istaroxime did not appear to be associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias or increases in cardiac troponin T. The rate of cardiovascular-related adverse events was 23% for placebo, 10% for istaroxime low dose, and 18% for istaroxime high dose, with cardiac failure occurring in 3%, 5% and 8% of placebo, low dose and high dose patients, respectively. The cases of cardiac failure were reported by the investigator as “worsening of heart failure” symptoms that occurred approximately 10-14 days after study drug administration and were not considered to be drug related. The most common adverse drug reactions reported included pain at infusion site, generally associated with use of short catheters, and dose-related gastrointestinal adverse events in 5%, 10% and 38% of placebo, low dose and high dose patients, respectively. Serious adverse events included one cardiac death and one case of cardiogenic shock (in the same patient who died) in the istaroxime 1.0 µg/kg/min group, two cases of cardiac failure in the 0.5 µg/kg/min group, three cases of cardiac failure in the 1.0 µg/kg/min group, and one case of renal embolism in the 1.0 µg/kg/min group.

Based on feedback from the FDA in June 2019 and discussions with our scientific advisors, to advance istaroxime for the treatment of AHF potentially through the phase 2 clinical program and be in a phase 3-ready position, our strategy includes, subject to adequate resources, planning an additional phase 2 clinical trial that will enroll approximately 300 patients in approximately 60 clinical sites globally. This trial will focus on treating heart failure patients with low blood pressure, who also tend to be diuretic resistant, as a patient population that we believe could particularly benefit from the unique profile and potential ability of istaroxime to increase cardiac function and increase blood pressure while maintaining or improving renal function. This trial will also collect data on measures that may serve as primary endpoints in a phase 3 clinical trial, and will include an optimized dosing regimen, potentially extending the infusion time beyond 24 hours. We currently do not have sufficient capital to execute this clinical trial. We are exploring capital from public and private equity offerings and potential strategic opportunities to fund the initiation of this clinical trial, and plan to initiate the clinical trial after obtaining adequate funding. We plan to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on hospital resources and resulting potential changes in regulatory timelines for conducting non-COVID-19-related clinical trials.

Rostafuroxin
 
Rostafuroxin is a novel investigational drug product candidate being developed for the treatment of hypertension in patients with a specific genetic profile, which is found in approximately 20% - 25% of the adult hypertensive population.
  Hypertension Overview

According to the CDC, patients with high blood pressure have a greater risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the U.S. Nearly half of adults in the U.S. (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or are taking medication for hypertension. In 2018, nearly half a million deaths in the U.S. included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. Only about 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control. Patients often have persistent hypertension despite being on multiple therapies. Ethnicity and genetic makeup are known to impact the response to anti-hypertensive treatments, and uncontrolled hypertension has been associated with certain genetic makeups. Given the size of the market and the prevalence of unmet medical needs, major pharmaceutical companies have maintained hypertension as a key area of focus and continue to seek new drugs to compete in markets they have established with previous anti-hypertensive therapies. We are currently engaged in a process to test the industry’s interest in investing in new drugs in this market, and plan to pursue potential licensing transactions and/or other strategic opportunities with a company that has interest in and/or operates in the anti-hypertension market.

Method of Action
 
Rostafuroxin is designed to be a selective antagonist of adducin polymorphisms and endogenous ouabain, both known triggers of hypertension, and creates functional effects by enhancing renal tubular sodium reabsorption and increasing vascular tone.
Clinical Development
 
Rostafuroxin has been studied in three phase 2 clinical trials assessing reduction in blood pressure in a hypertensive population selected in accordance with a specified genetic profile. A phase 2b clinical trial was conducted as a two-part study with the first part conducted in Italy with Caucasian patients and the second part conducted in Taiwan with ethnic Chinese patients. The efficacy results in Italy were positive in both this trial and in an earlier phase 2a clinical trial; however, the blood pressure response in Chinese patients in the second part of the phase 2b study was minimal.
 
Rostafuroxin has demonstrated efficacy in Caucasian patients in treatment naïve hypertension in a phase 2b trial. During the second quarter, we concluded an initial process to test the industry’s interest in investing in our product candidate. We currently have not been able to secure a licensing transaction or other strategic opportunity. As a result, we recorded an impairment of the related intangible asset (see, Note 4 – Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements – Goodwill and Intangible Assets). Based on feedback received from potential licensing partners, we have determined that there is a need for an additional phase 2 clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy in non-Caucasian patients in treatment resistant hypertension. We are continuing to pursue licensing arrangements and/or other strategic partnerships for rostafuroxin. We do not intend to conduct the additional phase 2 clinical trial without securing such an arrangement or partnership.

The API used in the production of the drug product candidate is manufactured by SciAnda (Changshu) Pharmaceutical, Ltd.
 
Preclinical Heart Failure Product Candidates
 
We are pursuing early exploratory research to assess our preclinical follow-on oral and intravenous SERCA2a activator heart failure compounds. To advance these product candidates, we are actively exploring potential licensing transactions, research partnership arrangements or other strategic opportunities.
KL4 Surfactant
 
We believe our KL4 surfactant and ADS technologies may potentially support a product pipeline to address a range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. Since completing our phase 2 study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury in January 2022, in order to preserve resources for the highest priority programs, we have begun to reduce costs not already transferred to our licensee in Asia, Lee’s (HK), under the terms of our Asia License Agreement. These costs include certain reductions in headcount dedicated to KL4 surfactant and the decommissioning of both our analytical and technical support laboratory, which previously conducted release testing of APIs and supportive research for our lyophilized and aerosolized KL4 surfactant, and our medical device development laboratory, which was previously used to conduct development activities and testing for our ADS technologies. To support the future development of our KL4 surfactant platform in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S., we are pursuing one or more licensing transactions.
COVID-19 related Lung Injury Overview
 
Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may progress to ARDS and require supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. ARDS has no approved therapies and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare resource utilization. The COVID-19 virus infects via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, or ACE2, on surfactant producing cells in the lung. This impairs surfactant production, resulting in poor gas exchange, decreased lung compliance, and increased likelihood of needing mechanical ventilation. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence shows surfactant replacement therapy has the potential to improve lung function, oxygenation, lung compliance and decrease pulmonary inflammation. These beneficial effects could lead to potential clinical improvements such as decreased need for mechanical ventilation, decreased time on ventilator (freeing the devices for other patients) and possibly mortality.
 
RDS Overview
 
Our KL4 surfactant can be lyophilized (freeze-dried) and reconstituted to a liquid just prior to administration. We have in the past considered potential development pathways to secure marketing approval for lyophilized KL4 surfactant as an intratracheal instillate for the treatment and/or prevention of RDS in premature infants who, because they are unable to breathe on their own or other reason, are not candidates for AEROSURF. Lyophilized KL4 surfactant is the drug product component of AEROSURF and a lyophilized (freeze-dried) dosage form of the liquid KL4 surfactant intratracheal instillate, SURFAXIN®, that was approved by the FDA in 2012, but the SURFAXIN drug product was withdrawn from the market by us voluntarily in 2015 to focus our resources on the development of aerosolized KL4 surfactant for respiratory diseases, beginning with AEROSURF. We have demonstrated in laboratory experiments that our lyophilized KL4 surfactant retains many of the key attributes and characteristics of SURFAXIN. We expect that Lee’s (HK) will continue to pursue approval of lyophilized KL4 surfactant in Asia pursuant to the Asia License Agreement.
 
Clinical Development
 
COVID-19 related Lung Injury
 
In January 2022, we completed enrollment of 20 patients in our study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury. The phase 2 trial was designed to assess feasibility, safety, and tolerability of administration of reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant in these critically ill patients. The multicenter, single-arm study enrolled 20 critically ill patients who were intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe COVID-19 associated ARDS. Patients received lucinactant as a liquid via the endotracheal tube assessing safety and tolerability of the administration procedure and of the drug. Oxygenation and other physiological responses were also measured. Study sites were in the U.S. and Argentina.
 
    8 

  

The study demonstrated that intratracheal administration of reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant was generally safe and well tolerated. Lucinactant was safely administered to critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS. Oxygenation and other physiological parameters were stable to improved after dosing, supporting the feasibility of this treatment approach to develop a potential treatment for critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes.
 
AEROSURF
 
Overview
 
AEROSURF® (lucinactant for inhalation) is an investigational drug/medical device combination product candidate to improve the management of RDS in premature infants who may not have fully developed natural lung surfactant and may require surfactant therapy to sustain life. AEROSURF is designed to deliver aerosolized KL4 surfactant noninvasively using our proprietary ADS technology and potentially may meaningfully reduce the use of invasive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
Clinical Development
 
On March 18, 2020, we entered into the Term Sheet with Lee’s (HK) pursuant to which Lee’s (HK) agreed to provide financing to fund the development of AEROSURF for the period April 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020 and make payments of up to $3.9 million (which was reduced to $2.8 million under specified circumstances) prior to September 1, 2020. In August 2020, we entered into the PF Agreement with Lee’s (HK), formalizing the terms of the Term Sheet, and under which we received payments totaling $2.8 million through October 2020. Pursuant to the PF Agreement, Lee’s (HK) agreed to pay additional amounts to be set forth in an updated development budget to be agreed between the parties by September 1, 2020 and updated every six months thereafter, to fund the continued development of AEROSURF and to be paid with the payment schedule to be set forth in each updated development budget. In partial satisfaction of our obligations under the PF Agreement, we agreed to pay Lee’s (HK) 50% of any Commercialization Net Revenues (as defined in the PF Agreement) up to an amount that is equal to 125% of the Project Expenses (as defined in the PF Agreement) funded by Lee’s (HK). On November 12, 2020, Lee’s (HK) provided notice of termination of additional funding under the PF Agreement, and we and Lee’s (HK) revised our plans for the continued development of AEROSURF. Lee’s (HK) agreed to continue the development of AEROSURF in Asia at its own cost. Lee’s (HK) agreed to fund an additional $1.0 million to us in 2021 for certain transition and analytical services to be provided by us with respect to the development of AEROSURF, which will be considered “Project Expenses” under the terms of the PF Agreement. In 2021, we received payments totaling $1.0 million from Lee’s (HK) and no further amounts are due under the PF Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
 
Since the 2018 acquisition of CVie Investments Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary CVie Therapeutics Limited, istaroxime has become our primary focus for investment and execution due to what we believe represents a greater potential value opportunity for us and our stockholders. Since completing our phase 2 study of lucinactant (KL4 surfactant) for patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS and lung injury in January 2022, in order to preserve resources for the highest priority programs, we have begun to reduce costs not already transferred to our licensee in Asia, Lee’s (HK), under the terms of our Asia License Agreement. These costs include certain reductions in headcount dedicated to KL4 surfactant and the decommissioning of both our analytical and technical support laboratory, which previously conducted release testing of APIs and supportive research for our lyophilized and aerosolized KL4 surfactant, and our medical device development laboratory, which was previously used to conduct development activities and testing for our ADS technologies. To support the future development of our KL4 surfactant platform in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S., we are pursuing one or more licensing transactions.
 
Manufacturing
 
KL4 surfactant is comprised of four APIs, which were previously supplied to us by sole-source suppliers under now expired supply agreements or purchase orders.
 
 Our lyophilized KL4 surfactant was manufactured for us by Pharma Services Group, Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, or Patheon. In March 2022, we provided notice to Patheon of our plans to wind-down our Master Services Agreement dated as of October 24, 2013 for the manufacture of lyophilized KL4 surfactant. Manufacturing of the KL4 drug product in both liquid and lyophilized forms is in the process of being transferred to our licensee in Asia, Lee’s (HK), under the terms of our Asia License Agreement.

 With respect to our ADS, we are currently undertaking a technology transfer of our device manufacturing process from Battelle Memorial Institute, or Battelle, to Mack Molding Company, or Mack, an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer. We currently have a Memorandum of Understanding with Mack to cover this transfer. Upon completion of the technology transfer to Mack, we expect that the manufacturing of the ADS will be transferred to our licensee in Asia, Lee’s (HK), under the terms of our Asia License Agreement.

Upon termination of the Asia License Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular product or country, generally all related rights and licenses granted to Lee’s (HK) will terminate, all rights under our technology will revert to us, and Lee’s (HK) will cease all use of our technology.
 
Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca Collaboration Agreement
 
In April 2015, our subsidiary, CVie Therapeutics Limited, or CVie Therapeutics, entered into an Agreement for Scientific Collaboration, or the 2015 Agreement, with the Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, or Bicocca, in Milan, Italy, focused on defining the role of SERCA2a and phospholamban, or PLN, in modulating cardiac contraction, and discovering new small molecules to modulate SERCA2a activity or new drugs for treating chronic and acute human heart failure. The initial term of the 2015 Agreement, which was three years, was extended for approximately an additional year, with an option for further renewal. In June 2019, we entered into a new Agreement for Scientific Collaboration with Bicocca, or the 2019 Agreement, focused on continuing the studies under the 2015 Agreement. The 2019 Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior agreements with Bicocca.
 
Under the 2019 Agreement, we provided funds aggregating € 0.16 million (approximately $0.178 million) to extend our use of Bicocca laboratories and to fund research conducted pursuant to the collaboration. (Under the 2015 Agreement, Bicocca had given us exclusive use of a research laboratory for the collaboration work, and nonexclusive access to a physiology laboratory within the university.) Under the 2019 Agreement, any results obtained from the collaboration are jointly owned by the parties. However, Bicocca has agreed to assign to us its interest in patent applications and patents covering any new SERCA2a activator compounds and diagnostic products suitable for further clinical development. We have agreed to pay Bicocca (corresponding to stage of development): (i) € 0.1 million (approximately $0.11 million) for new SERCA2a activator compounds developed up to phase 1 studies in humans upon the completion and availability of the proof of concept of biological efficacy of new compounds on modulating the SERCA2a activity in cell-free systems, or its functional counterpart in cardiac myocytes and (ii) € 1.5 million (approximately $1.7 million) upon obtaining marketing authorization in the U.S., EU, or China of new compounds with the corresponding companion diagnostic assay. We have also agreed to pay royalties on products generated from the collaboration in the range of a fraction of a single digit to a low single digit percent of net sales for any products sold in any country for a period of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or until the expiry of patent(s) covering the products.
 
On March 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement for Scientific Collaboration, or the New SERCA2a Agreement, with Bicocca, which extends our collaboration. The New SERCA2a Agreement amends and restates the recently expired terms of the prior collaboration agreement. Under the New SERCA2a Agreement, we will provide Bicocca with approximately € 0.2 million (approximately $0.2 million) for research activities and to cover laboratory space and operation costs. Results obtained from the collaboration will be jointly owned by the parties. However, Bicocca will assign to us its interest in patent applications and patents covering any new SERCA2a compounds and diagnostic products suitable for further clinical development. We have agreed to pay Bicocca (corresponding to stage of development): (i) € 25,000 for execution of an assignment to us of Bicocca’s interest in the patent at issue, (ii) € 75,000 for new SERCA2a compounds developed up to phase 1 studies in humans upon the completion and availability of the proof of concept of biological efficacy of new compounds on modulating the SERCA2a activity in cell-free systems, or its functional counterpart in isolated cells and (iii) € 1.5 million upon obtaining marketing authorization in the U.S., EU, or China of new compounds with the corresponding companion diagnostic assay. We have also agreed to pay royalties on products generated from the collaboration in the range of a fraction of a single digit to a low single digit percent of net sales for any products sold in any country for a period of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or until the expiry of patent(s) covering the products.
 
Philip Morris License Agreements
 
In 2008, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Philip Morris USA, Inc., or PMUSA, with respect to the U.S., or the U.S. License Agreement, and, as PMUSA had assigned its ex-U.S. rights to Philip Morris Products S.A., or PMPSA, effective on the same date and on substantially the same terms and conditions, we entered into a license agreement with PMPSA with respect to rights outside of the U.S., which we refer to, together with the U.S. License Agreement, as the PM License Agreements. Under the PM License Agreements, we have worldwide exclusive rights to the PMUSA and PMPSA proprietary capillary aerosol technology, which is a key component of our ADS, for use in a drug/device combination product with pulmonary surfactants (alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical compounds) for all respiratory diseases and conditions. In addition, under the U.S. License Agreement, our license to use the capillary aerosol technology includes certain non-surfactant drugs to treat certain designated pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. See also, “– Patents and Proprietary Rights – Aerosol Delivery System (ADS) Patent Rights.”
 
    10 

  

Under the PM License Agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate equal to a low single-digit percent of sales of products sold in the Exclusive Field (as defined in the PM License Agreements) in the territories. In connection with exclusive undertakings of PMUSA and PMPSA not to exploit the aerosol technology for all licensed uses, we are obligated to pay royalties on all product sales, including sales of certain aerosol devices that are not based on the licensed aerosol technology; provided, however, that no royalties are payable to the extent that we exercise our right to terminate the license with respect to a specific indication. While there is no legal obligation under the PM License Agreements to make minimum royalty payments, in the event we do not make quarterly minimum royalty payments, PMUSA and PMPSA can terminate the PM License Agreements. In making such payments, we are entitled to reduce future quarterly royalties above the quarterly minimums in the amount of the true-up payments we make to satisfy minimum royalties for prior quarters. Our license rights extend to innovations to the aerosol technology that are made under the PM License Agreements.
 
In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreements, we may terminate the PM License Agreements, in whole or in part, upon advance written notice to the licensor. In addition, either party to each PM License Agreement may terminate upon a material breach by the other party (subject to a specified cure period). PMUSA and PMPSA may also terminate the PM License Agreements in the event that we fail to make certain minimum royalty payments. Our license under each PM License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will expire as to each licensed product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the date on which the sale of such licensed product ceases to be covered by a valid patent claim in such country; the date a generic form of the product is introduced in such country; or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product.
 
Battelle Collaboration Agreement
 
In October 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Battelle, or, as amended, the Battelle Collaboration Agreement, for the development of our new ADS for use in our phase 3 program. We had previously worked with Battelle, which has expertise in developing and integrating aerosol devices using innovative and advanced technologies, in connection with development of our phase 2 ADS used in the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial. Under the Battelle Collaboration Agreement, we and Battelle shared the costs of development for a three-stage development plan that included planning, executing the project plan and testing and completing verification and documentation of a new phase 3 ADS, putting us in a position to manufacture a new phase 3 ADS for use in the remaining AEROSURF development activities, including a potential phase 3 clinical program, and, if approved, initial commercial activities. We retained final decision-making authority over all matters related to the design, registration, manufacture, packaging, marketing, distribution and sale of the phase 3 ADS. We and Battelle shared the costs of the project plan equally. Battelle agreed to bear the cost of any cost overruns associated with the project plan and we agreed to bear the cost of any increase in cost resulting from changes in the scope of the product requirements. We also agreed that, if Battelle successfully completed the project plan in a timely manner, we would pay Battelle royalties equal to a low single-digit percentage of the worldwide net sales and license royalties on sales of AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, up to an initial aggregate limit of $25.0 million, which under a payment restructuring agreement (discussed below), was increased to $35.0 million. The Battelle Collaboration Agreement will end at the time we fulfill our payment obligations to Battelle, unless sooner terminated by a party as provided therein.
Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. Strategic Alliance
 
We have a strategic alliance with Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A., or Esteve, for the development, marketing and sales of a portfolio of potential KL4 surfactant products in Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, or, collectively, the Territory. Under the alliance, Esteve will pay us a transfer price on sales of our KL4 surfactant products. We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of all covered products and Esteve will be responsible for all sales and marketing in the Territory. Esteve is obligated to make stipulated cash payments to us upon our achievement of certain milestones, primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for the covered products. In addition, Esteve has agreed to contribute to phase 3 clinical trials for the covered products by conducting and funding development performed in the Territory. As part of a 2004 restructuring, Esteve returned certain countries to us, referred to as the Former Esteve Territories, and we agreed to pay Esteve 10% of any cash up front and milestone fees (up to a maximum aggregate of $20.0 million) that we receive in connection with any strategic collaborations for the development and/or commercialization of certain of our KL4 surfactant products in the Former Esteve Territories. In addition, with respect to our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, Esteve will pay us $0.5 million upon the initial filing for regulatory approval with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and $0.5 million upon receipt of regulatory approval. Esteve will also contribute up to $3 million to support a phase 3 clinical trial in the Territory. The alliance will terminate as to each covered product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the expiration of the last patent claim related to a covered product in such country; the first commercial sale in such country of the first-to-appear generic formulation of the covered product, and the tenth anniversary of the first sale of the covered product in such country. In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreement by a party, the alliance agreement may be terminated by Esteve on 60 days’ prior written notice, up to the date of receipt of the first marketing regulatory approval, or, on up to six months’ written notice, if the first marketing regulatory approval has issued. We may terminate the alliance agreement in the event that Esteve acquires a competitive product (as defined in the agreement).
Johnson & Johnson License Agreement
 
Our precision-engineered KL4 surfactant technology was invented at The Scripps Research Institute, or Scripps, and was exclusively licensed to and further developed by Johnson & Johnson, or J&J. Pursuant to a license agreement, dated October 28, 1996, with J&J and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, or the J&J license, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license and sublicense to a series of over 30 patents and patent filings (worldwide), or the J&J Patents. All J&J Patents have expired. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay the licensors fees of up to $3.0 million in the aggregate upon our achievement of certain milestones, primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for certain designated products. We have made milestone payments totaling $1.0 million to date. In addition, the agreement provides that we are required to pay royalties at different rates based on the type of revenue and country, in amounts in the range of a high single-digit percent of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) of licensed products sold by us or sublicensees, or, if greater, a percentage of royalty income from sublicensees in the low double digits. The license agreement provides that the license will expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the payment of royalties for all licensed products for ten years beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such country. Thereafter, the license agreement provides that royalties shall be paid in respect of a licensed product until the expiration of the last licensed patent containing a valid claim covering the licensed product in such country. For countries in the EU in which royalties are paid only by virtue of licensed know-how, royalties shall be payable commencing from the date of first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such country and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which the licensed know-how becomes public or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in any country of the EU. In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreement by a party, we may terminate the agreement, as to countries other than the U.S. and Western Europe territories (as defined in the agreement), on a country-by-country basis, on six months’ prior written notice; and as to the entire agreement, on 60 days’ prior written notice.

Intellectual Property
 
We continue to invest in maintaining and enforcing our potential competitive position through a number of means: (i) by protecting our exclusive rights in our cardiovascular agents including istaroxime, rostafuroxin and SERCA2a activators, (ii) by protecting our exclusive rights in our lyophilized KL4 surfactant, ADS and aerosol-conducting airway connector technologies through patents that we own or exclusively license, (iii) by seeking regulatory exclusivities, including potential Orphan Drug and new drug product exclusivities, and (iv) through protecting our trade secrets and proprietary methodologies that support our manufacturing and analytical processes.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
In addition to the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been active in identifying and seeking to identify new inventions eligible for patent protection. We have filed and plan to file patent and provisional patent applications to protect our innovations relating to our current and potential future product candidates, including for composition of matter, new dosage forms, formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of use and related processes. We intend to file for patent protection for select inventions, in such markets that we deem material to our patent strategy, as well as for other new inventions that we may identify.
Our Patents and Patent Applications Related to Rostafuroxin, Istaroxime and SERCA2a Activators
 
We hold a patent portfolio of six patent families that include patents and patent applications directed to compounds, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of manufacturing, methods of delivery, and/or treatment methods using istaroxime, rostafuroxin, their metabolites and/or derivatives, as well as SERCA2a activators, for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and related conditions. We plan to continue these patent activities and focus on new follow-on compounds, dosage forms, formulations, and treatment methods related to AHF and persistent hypertension. To benefit from potential non-patent exclusivity within the U.S., we believe that we may qualify istaroxime as a new chemical entity entitled to market exclusivity for a period of years. See the section titled “- Government Regulation - Drug Products - The Hatch-Waxman Act - Market Exclusivity.”

Trademarks
 
AEROSURF®, AFECTAIR®, SURFAXIN®, SURFAXIN LS™, WINDTREE THERAPEUTICS® (logo), WINDTREE™ and WINDTREE THERAPEUTICS™ are our material registered and common law trademarks.
 
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to our patent exclusivities, we rely on trade secrets to protect and maintain our competitive position. We take measures to protect and maintain our trade secrets and know-how licensed to us or developed by us by entering in confidentiality agreements with third parties. Our trade secrets and know-how include information related to manufacturing processes for our drug product candidates and devices, analytical methods and procedures, research and development activities, provisional patent applications, as well as certain information provided to the FDA that was not made public which relates to our regulatory activities and clinical trials.
Other Regulatory Designations
 
Orphan Drug and Orphan Medicinal Product Designations
 
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of ARDS in adults, and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. See the section titled “- Government Regulation - Drug Products - Orphan Drugs.”
 
The European Commission, or EC, grants Orphan Medicinal Product designation for pharmaceutical products for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people which provides for exclusive marketing rights for indications in Europe for 10 years (subject to revision after six years) following marketing approval by the EMA. In addition, the designation would enable us to receive regulatory assistance in the further development process, and to access reduced regulatory fees throughout its marketing life. The EC has granted Orphan Medicinal Product designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention of RDS in premature neonates of less than 32 weeks gestational age, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of RDS in premature neonates of less than 37 weeks gestational age, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of ALI (which in this circumstance encompasses ARDS), and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. In submitting the requests to the EMA for Orphan Medicinal Product designations, instead of listing the drug product under the USAN name (lucinactant) as we have in the U.S., we were required to submit our requests under the names of the four APIs in our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) as follows: sinapultide (KL4), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol and palmitic acid.
 
Fast Track Designations
 
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for (i) istaroxime for the treatment of AHF, (ii) AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature neonates, and (iii) SURFAXIN® for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature neonates and the treatment of ARDS in adults. We believe that other of our product candidates may qualify for Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation or other expedited programs. These designations and programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. See the section titled “- Government Regulation - Drug Products - Fast Track Designation.”
Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is a highly competitive industry. As we work to gain marketing authorization for our product candidates, in some therapeutic areas, competition from numerous existing pharmaceutical companies and other companies entering our fields is expected to be intense and expected to increase. In fact, our future competitors are competing with us currently to secure access to development resources, including clinical sites and their patients to advance development programs. We expect that those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Moreover, there are also existing therapies that may compete with the products we are developing. Therefore, as a development stage biotechnology company, our competitors are comprised of other biotechnology firms and pharmaceutical companies that have existing products or are developing products for our primary markets -- respiratory and cardiovascular indications.
Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, clearance, labeling, promotion, advertising and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve or clear pending new submissions to market drugs or devices warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before they may be marketed in the U.S. Drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries.
Drug Products
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must be accepted before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
    14 

  

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit- risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. may be accepted by the FDA subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an onsite inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection or other appropriate means.
 
The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,875,000 for fiscal year 2021, and the applicant under an approved new drug application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $336,000 per product for fiscal year 2021. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
    15 

  

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and the FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition - generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven- year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan Drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Fast Track Designation
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
Under the Fast Track program, sponsors have the opportunity to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Breakthrough Therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
    16 

  

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Market Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDC Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDC Act provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not receive for review an ANDA or file a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDC Act also provides three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions for use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the non-clinical studies and adequate and well- controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Patent Term Extension
 
After NDA approval, the owner of a relevant drug patent may apply for up to five years of patent term extension. Only one patent may be extended for each regulatory review period, which is composed of two parts: a testing phase, and an approval phase. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase - the time between the day the IND becomes effective and NDA submission - and all of the review phase - the time between NDA submission and approval - up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total remaining patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent term extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent term extension granted, the post-approval patent term extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent term extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to- consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by the FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or Biologics License Application, or BLA, submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Medical Device Products
 
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory which is: (i) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the US Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them; (ii) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or (iii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
 
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed.
 
Generally, establishments that manufacture and/or distribute devices, including manufacturers, contract manufacturers, sterilizers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, reprocessors of single-use devices, remanufacturers, initial importers, manufacturers of accessories and components sold directly to the end user, and U.S. manufacturers of export-only devices, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
 
Pre-market Authorization and Notification
 
While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a premarket approval application, or PMA, prior to marketing, generally applicable to Class III devices; or (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because the FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices. Other less common regulatory pathways to market for certain devices include the de novo classification process, the humanitarian device exception, or a product development protocol.
The 510(k) Clearance Process
 
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device.
 
A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, often referred to as a preamendments device, and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA has a performance goal to complete its review of 95% of 510(k) submissions within 90 days of receipt. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, because the FDA can request additional date and information, which pauses the review clock for up to 180 days, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to- file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s).
 
    18 

  

The PMA Approval Process
 
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has a performance goal to review 90% of PMA applications within 180 days, if advisory committee input is not required, and within 320 days, if advisory committee input is required, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (i.e., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
 

● | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from preclinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life- sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 
Exempt Devices
 
If a manufacturer’s device falls into a generic category of Class I or Class II devices that the FDA has exempted by regulation, a premarket notification is not required before marketing the device in the U.S. Manufacturers of such devices are required to register their establishments and list the proprietary device name and the generic category or classification regulation into which the device fits. Some 510(k)-exempt devices are also exempt from Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements.
Post-market Requirements
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).
 
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution.

Combination Products
 
A combination product is a product comprised of (i) two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/medical device, biologic/medical device, drug/biologic, or drug/medical device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where, upon approval of the proposed product, the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, i.e., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
 
The FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center.
 
Regulation Outside the U.S.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside the U.S. require that clinical trial applications be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the U.S. before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an Orphan Drug under EU regulatory systems, we are mandated to submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, in centralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which came into operation in 1995, allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products and for human products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the Community before May 20, 2004 (date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) and which are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the Community before May 20, 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a Community authorization is in the interests of patients at Community level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the EMA, to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The procedure results in an EC decision, which is valid in all EU Member States. Centrally-authorized products may be marketed in all EU Member States.
 
In centralized procedure, full copies of the MAA are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA’s assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MAA has been granted. The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant’s replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and, taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it shall include the draft summary of the product’s characteristics, the package leaflet and the texts proposed for the various packaging materials. The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days. The EMA then has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the EC. This is the start of the second phase of the procedure: the decision-making process.
 
The EMA sends to the EC its opinion and assessment report, together with annexes containing: the SmPC (Annex 1); the particulars of the Marketing Authorisation Holder, or MAH, responsible for batch release, the particulars of the manufacturer of the active substance and the conditions of the marketing authorization (Annex 2); and the labeling and the package leaflet (Annex 3). The annexes are translated into the 22 other official languages of the EU. During the decision-making process, the EC services verify that the marketing authorization complies with EU law. The EC has fifteen days to prepare a draft decision. The medicinal product is assigned a Community registration number, which will be placed on its packaging if the marketing authorization is granted. During this period, various EC directorates general are consulted on the draft marketing authorization decision. The draft decision is then sent to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (EU Member States have one representative each in both of these committees) for their opinions.
 
The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to the public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states.

Applications from persons or companies seeking “orphan medicinal product designation” for products they intend to develop for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU are reviewed by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP. In addition, Orphan Drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed Orphan Drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for fee reductions for protocol assistance and access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing approval, which reductions are not limited to the first year after marketing approval for small and medium enterprises. In addition, if a product which has an Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives EMA marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means the EMA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 10 years. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Competitors may receive marketing approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In order to do so, however, they must demonstrate that the new drugs or biologics provide a significant benefit over the existing orphan product. This demonstration of significant benefit may be done at the time of initial approval or in post-approval studies, depending on the type of marketing authorization granted.
 
A pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the EU. Medicines authorized across the EU with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months. This is the case even when the studies’ results are negative. For orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization, or PUMA. If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive.
 
The European Union Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. This directive has been separately enacted in more detail in the national legislation of the individual member states of the EU. On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), or MDR, which repeals and replaces the MDD and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. The changes were prompted by divergent interpretations of the current directives and to address issues concerning product quality and performance. The MDR went into effect on May 26, 2021, and it:
 

● | strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals, and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under both the MDD and the MDR, the system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certificated device is marked with a Conformitè Europëenne mark, or CE mark, which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité, also referred to as a Certificate of Conformance. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD (and now the MDR) within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for CE mark varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled before a CE mark can be placed on a product, known as a conformity assessment. Conformity assessments for products are carried out as required by the MDD (and now the MDR). Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-certify compliance with the MDD (and now the MDR) based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU MDD, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a member state of the European Economic Area, or EEA, to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the EU without further conformance tests being required in other member states.
 
Under transitional provisions provided in the MDR, medical devices that had valid CE Certificates of Conformity issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2021 may, provided related obligations are respected, continue to be placed on the EEA market for the remaining validity of the certificate, and until May 27, 2024 at the latest. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked on the basis of the MDR may be placed on the market in the EEA.
 
Post-Brexit, the MDR does not apply in the United Kingdom, or UK, (except for Northern Ireland, which under the Northern Irish Protocol is bound by certain EU laws). The medical device legislative framework in the UK is set out in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. These regulations are based on the previous medical device directives of the EU, but have been amended so that they function properly now that the UK is no longer part of the EU. The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 have introduced several changes including (but not limited to) replacing the CE mark with a UK Conformity Assessed marking (although EU CE marks will be recognized until June 30, 2023), requiring manufacturers outside of the UK to appoint a UK Responsible Person if they place devices on the market in the UK and more wide-ranging device registration requirements.
 
In addition, there are new regulations for in vitro diagnostics, Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices, and these will fully apply beginning in May 2022.

International Approvals
 
Drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the U.S. but are not harmonized. International regulators are independent and not bound by the findings of the FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept clinical trial design/results or may require additional data or other information not requested by the FDA. In addition, international regulators may require different manufacturing practices than the FDA’s cGMPs.
Reimbursement
 
Potential sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product candidate, if approved, or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In the U.S., the Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary outpatient drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries for certain products. We do not know whether our product candidates, if approved, will be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but individual Medicare Part D plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies.
 
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws and Other Regulations
 
In addition to the FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and combination products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the medical product industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information.i
 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 
Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
    22 

  

Privacy and Security laws
 
HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose privacy, security transmission and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information, including protected health information, or PHI, upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that perform services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, including PHI. HIPAA imposes criminal liability and amends provisions on the reporting, investigation, enforcement, and penalizing of civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, as well as knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme, or device or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, state attorney generals have authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
 
Many states have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, to which we are subject. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.
 
Federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, may require us to undertake compliance efforts that could be costly and time consuming or subject us to liability for a failure to comply.
 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
 
Manufacturers of prescription drugs are required to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis and the reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also be required.
 
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Additional jurisdictions, such as the City of Chicago and the District of Columbia, require pharmaceutical sales representatives to be licensed and meet continuing education requirements. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act.

 There have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act or any of its provisions.
 
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans by increasing from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
 
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. As noted above, the 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase.
 
Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
 
Further changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, but it is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace or revise the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Our industry is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Recent enacted legislation has expanded the SEC’s power to seek disgorgement in all FCPA cases filed in federal court and extended the statute of limitations in SEC enforcement actions in intent-based claims such as those under the FCPA from five years to ten years.

International laws
 
In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these antibribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 
CVie Acquisition
 
In December 2018, we acquired CVie Investments Limited, or CVie Investments, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, which we refer to herein as the CVie Acquisition. Since the CVie Acquisition, we have operated CVie Investments and its wholly owned subsidiary, CVie Therapeutics Limited, or CVie Therapeutics, a Taiwan corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of China, as a subsidiary focused on the development of drug product candidates for cardiovascular diseases.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 31, 2022, we have 33 full-time employees, 28 of whom are based in the U.S. Our employees are skilled in drug and device development, including clinical trial design, clinical operations in support of our clinical trials and related activities, corporate administration, finance and business development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also work with independent professional advisors and consultants to support our program development activities, particularly in the areas of drug product development, regulatory, compliance, and international clinical operations.
 
We believe our human capital resources are fundamental to our success; as such, our corporate objectives include recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating existing and new employees, advisors and consultants for the common purpose of increasing stockholder value and promoting the success of our company. Our compensation and equity incentive programs are designed to attract, retain and reward personnel through cash-based compensation and granting of stock-based awards intended to motivate such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and advance our corporate objectives. We endeavor to provide competitive benefits that will reward and retain our employees. Our compensation program includes competitive salary and annual bonus programs, comprehensive healthcare benefits for employees and dependent family members, paid time off, paid holidays, family medical leave and flexible work schedules. We sponsor a 401(k) plan and automatically enroll all employees when eligible and generally provide a discretionary matching corporate contribution. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and our company, and which complied with government regulations. This included initially providing all employees the option of working from home, while implementing additional workplace safety measures for employees working on site.
