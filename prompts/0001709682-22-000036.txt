Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Custom Truck One Source, Inc., formerly Nesco Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries are engaged in the business of providing a range of services and products to customers through rentals and sales of specialty equipment, rentals and sales of aftermarket parts and services related to the specialty equipment, and repair, maintenance, and customization services related to that equipment. Immediately following the acquisition by Nesco Holdings II, Inc. of Custom Truck One Source, L.P. (“Custom Truck LP”) as discussed in Note 3: Business Combination, on April 1, 2021 (the “Acquisition”), Nesco Holdings, Inc. (“Nesco Holdings”) changed its name to “Custom Truck One Source, Inc.” and changed The New York Stock Exchange ticker for its shares of common stock (“Common Stock”) from “NSCO” to “CTOS,” and the ticker of its redeemable warrants from “NSCO.WS” to “CTOS.WS.” Terms such as, “we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company” refer to Nesco Holdings prior to the Acquisition, and to the combined company after the Acquisition. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Nesco” or “Nesco Holdings” as used in these financial statements means Nesco Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Acquisition, and the term “Custom Truck LP” means Custom Truck LP and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to and on the date of the Acquisition.
We are a specialty equipment provider to the electric utility transmission and distribution, telecommunications, rail, and other infrastructure-related industries in North America. Our core business relates to our new equipment inventory and rental fleet of specialty equipment that is utilized by service providers in infrastructure development and improvement work. We offer our specialized equipment to a diverse customer base, including utilities and contractors, for the maintenance, repair, upgrade, and installation of critical infrastructure assets, including distribution and transmission electric lines, telecommunications networks, and rail systems, as well as for lighting and signage. We rent, produce, sell, and service a broad range of new and used equipment, including bucket trucks, digger derricks, dump trucks, cranes, service trucks, and heavy-haul trailers. Following the Acquisition, we changed our reportable segments to be consistent with how we currently manage the business, representing three reporting segments: Equipment Rental Solutions (“ERS”), Truck and Equipment Sales (“TES”), and Aftermarket Parts and Services (“APS”). Segment information provided within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Note 21: Segments, has been adjusted for all prior periods to be consistent with the current reportable segment presentation.
We operate with a differentiated “one-stop-shop” business model, offering equipment rental, new and used equipment sales, and aftermarket parts and service out of more than 37 locations across the U.S. and Canada. Customers receive additional support throughout the country from Custom Truck’s twenty-four hour, seven-day a week (“24/7”) call center, approximately 80 mobile technicians, and over 100 third-party locations. Custom Truck and its customers also benefit from its sophisticated sourcing model and large-scale integrated production and customization capabilities, which enhance the quality and diversity of its equipment offerings, reduce both cost and lead times for equipment sales and provide greater flexibility to optimize its rental fleet. These attributes, together with a strong reputation built over many years, position Custom Truck to capitalize on attractive secular growth trends across its end-markets. 
Custom Truck owns one of the industry’s largest fleets of specialty rental equipment focused on electric utility T&D, rail, telecommunications, and infrastructure end-markets through our ERS segment. As of December 31, 2021, our fleet is comprised of more than 9,000 units with an average unit age of approximately 3.8 years, which is young by typical rental fleet standards and compares favorably to the long useful life of the equipment. Our rental fleet is managed on a national level, which allows the company to efficiently reposition equipment in response to shifts in regional demand and thereby sustain strong utilization levels. 
As is customary among equipment rental companies, we sell used equipment out of our rental fleet to end user customers. We also offer a broad variety of new equipment for sale across our end-markets, often highly customized to meet its customers’ specific needs. Integrated production capabilities and extensive knowledge gained over a long history of selling equipment have positioned Custom Truck uniquely in the market as a trusted partner for customers seeking tailored solutions with short lead times. New and used equipment sales are done through our TES segment.
Through our APS segment, we provide our customers a total job-site solution, offering a range of products for rent or sale to fully equip their equipment and crews for activity in the field. Our comprehensive APS offering expands opportunities to serve our equipment rental and sales customers through the convenience of a single vendor for all their specialty equipment and APS needs.
End-Market Overview 
Our core end-markets include electric utility T&D, telecom, rail, and infrastructure. 
General End-Market Trends 
Combined annual capital expenditures in our core end-market exceeds $350 billion and grew 7.3% annually from 2001 to 2019 compared to 4.0% annual growth in U.S. GDP over the same period. Our end-markets have demonstrated limited correlation with GDP growth and resiliency through the recent economic cycle. 
The North American market has, and continues, to experience a secular shift from equipment ownership to rental. Rental penetration of the broader equipment fleet in North America increased from 42% in 2009 to 57% in 2019 and is expected to reach 65% by the mid-2020s. In comparison, other developed markets recorded higher rental penetration rates in 2017, including Europe at 65%, Japan at 80%, and the U.K. at 80%, demonstrating the future potential of the North American market. We believe that customers’ growing preference for equipment rental is driven by several factors including the avoidance of significant capital outlay, improved asset utilization, reduced storage and maintenance, access to a wider range of modern productive equipment, dedicated customer care, and operational efficiencies. As we believe that the rental penetration rate in the specialty equipment market is only an estimated 20 – 25% today, and that it will continue to trend towards the levels observed in the broader market, we think there will be significant growth within our specific markets. We purchase the majority of our chassis from several dealerships across our geographic footprint. The majority of our boom and crane components are sourced from a single supplier. 
On November 6th, 2021 the United States Congress passed, and the President of the United States signed, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “Infrastructure Act”). The Infrastructure Act allocates approximately $1 trillion in new and reallocated funds with positive impacts to each of our end-markets. 
Electric Utility T&D End-Market 
Maintaining safe and effective transmission and distribution lines is critical to national infrastructure, as they carry the electricity that powers the nation. Transmission lines carry high voltage electricity long distances, while distribution lines carry electricity from local transformers to houses and businesses. Our specialty equipment is used in the maintenance and repair of live lines and installation of new lines. Capital expenditure spend in the electric utility T&D end-market is approximately $68 billion annually. This spend is driven by a number of attractive dynamics, demonstrating that the U.S. is potentially in the very early stages of a multi-year electric utility T&D spending cycle.
Aging and Underinvested Electric Utility T&D Infrastructure - Electricity delivery in the U.S. depends on an aging and complex patchwork system of power generation facilities, transmission grids, local distribution lines, and substations. Most electric utility T&D lines were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s with a 50-year life expectancy and were not originally engineered to meet today’s load demands. Today, approximately 40% to 50% of existing electric utility T&D infrastructure is at or beyond its engineered life. Due in part to this aging infrastructure, costly electric emergency incidents and disturbances have increased more than sevenfold since 2000. Multiple costly fires have also been caused by aging and undermaintained transmission and distribution lines. As an example, in February 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric, an electric utility in California, announced that it is probable that its transmission line equipment caused the catastrophic fires in Paradise, CA three months prior. Maintenance work on the line had been delayed for several years. Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2019, recorded a $10.5 billion charge in anticipation of damage claims. California fire investigators determined that Pacific Gas & Electric’s equipment also played a role in starting 18 blazes in 2017. The prevention of additional incidents associated with the continued operations of aging electric utility T&D infrastructure is expected to continue to drive increasing levels of maintenance and repair and replacement spend by utilities.
Changing Generation Landscape - The ongoing transition from coal to gas and renewables continues to drive changes in the generation landscape and transmission project development. Twenty-nine states and Washington, D.C. have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which mandate that a certain percentage — most states target 10% to 45% — of electricity sold by a utility must come from renewable sources. The share of new renewables in the U.S. electricity generation mix will increase from 21% in 2020 to 42% in 2050. As a result, significant spend for new transmission lines will be required to interconnect these new sources of power with the electrical grid.
Increased Focus on Decarbonization - With an increased societal focus on decarbonization, major fossil fuel driven sectors are shifting towards electrification. The electrification of vehicles, heating technology, and industrial processes is expected to drive a significant increase in electricity demand and require a transmission investment of up to $90 billion by 2030.
Increased Outsourcing by Utilities - Utilities are increasingly turning to specialized third-party contractors to fulfill construction and maintenance needs. This outsourcing trend is driven by the challenge of an aging workforce and desire to shift the management and 
responsibilities of non-core activities to external service providers. Outsourcing is a favorable trend for us, given our rental penetration among electric utility T&D contractors who prefer to rent due to lower initial capital outlay, increased flexibility, improved asset utilization and productivity, and significantly reduced storage and maintenance costs.
The Infrastructure Act includes $7.5 billion to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers and $65 billion to upgrade power infrastructure. 
Telecom End-Market 
Telecommunications infrastructure, including telecom cells, towers, and wirelines, are the backbone of telephonic interaction and the transportation of mobile data. We provide the specialty equipment required to maintain and install telecom cells, towers, and communication lines. Construction spend on telecommunications infrastructure is approximately $80 billion annually. This spend is expected to grow significantly throughout the next decade due largely to the advent of 5G technology.
Rapid technological advancements, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase demand for greater wireline and wireless network capacity and reliability. Data traffic is at an all-time high and is expected to substantially increase in the future. United States data traffic is expected to grow at a 21% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2017 to 2022. In response to this demand, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile (the “Big 3 U.S. Telecom Operators”) are planning to increase speed and capacity through the deployment of 5G technology.
5G technology will require the installation of numerous higher bandwidth small cells to “densify” wireless networks and enhance performance. This is because small cells only deliver coverage within approximately a quarter mile of their location, compared to approximately five miles for the existing 4G and predecessor macro cells. As a result, approximately 20 times more small cells will need to be installed in order to provide the same level of coverage as the existing macro cells.
The spend required by the Big 3 Telecom Operators to deploy 5G technology is expected to grow at a 40% CAGR from 2019 to 2023, continuing into 2030 with total 2019 to 2030 spend of approximately $240 billion. The Infrastructure Act provided an additional $65 billion to increase access to reliable high-speed internet. 
Rail End-Market 
Freight and commuter rail are responsible for transporting products and people across the nation. Our rail mounted equipment is used for a variety of tasks including the installation of new rail and maintenance of the existing rail lines. Hi-rail equipment is utilized in projects for both installation and repair of track, electric lines, signal crossings, and signs. The equipment is also often used for working on older infrastructure such as repairing bridges and terminals with more antiquated track and systems that are in need of upgrades with more modern systems like Positive Train Control (“PTC”) and others. The six largest public railroads spend more than $10 billion annually in capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures are expected to continue to grow as freight demands increase. In addition to freight rail, spend on active commuter rail projects is significant with a growing pipeline.
Freight Rail - Freight rail, one of the most cost-effective, energy-efficient modes of transport, carries about 40% of intercity freight as measured by ton-miles, more than any other mode of transportation. Our North American customers are principally Class I railroads and related contractors. Class I railroads operate in 44 states across the U.S. and account for 94% of freight rail revenues in North America.
Commuter Rail - Trends such as population growth, increasing urbanization, a focus on sustainability, environmental awareness, and increasing highway congestion are expected to drive continued investment in commuter rail. Furthermore, as a result of years of insufficient funding, transit systems across the U.S. are struggling to cope with aging infrastructure, creating a massive and increasing backlog. The most recent federal estimate quantifies the backlog of projects required to attain a “state of good repair,” meaning public transit is repaired to an age within its average service life, at $90 billion — projected to grow to $122 billion by 2032. In August 2018, the U.S. Senate approved a fiscal-year 2019 appropriations bill that provides $16.1 billion for public transit and intercity passenger rail. Also in 2018, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s board adopted the Twenty-Eight by ’28 plan, which calls for completing 28 transportation projects at an estimated cost of $26 billion ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Los Angeles.
The Infrastructure Act provides $39 billion to modernize transportation and an additional $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transportation along with an additional $66 billion of funding specifically earmarked for passenger rail services. 
Infrastructure End-Market
We also serve the general infrastructure end-market, which includes surface transportation, national highway performance, highway safety, metropolitan transit, and other key infrastructure systems, including residential and non-residential waste and water. According 
to FMI Research, total infrastructure capex spend annually exceeds $200 billion and the infrastructure end market outlook remains positive. We anticipate the recent change in administration and growing bipartisan support will result in additional federal funds being allocated to infrastructure investment.
We consider the waste end market as part of the general infrastructure industry. Long-term, secular growth in this market is driven by growing waste volumes generated by increasing waste generation per capita. Population and income growth drive municipal solid waste generation. Municipal solid waste revenue grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.5% from 2003 to 2018. Waste is generally considered to be a recession-resistant industry given the non-discretionary nature of waste collection and disposal. Ongoing consolidation amongst waste haulers results in increasing market share for large, well-capitalized companies that have the resources to invest in the latest trucks and equipment.
The Infrastructure Act provides $55 billion to expand access to clean drinking water for households, businesses, schools, and child care centers across the United States.

Additionally, our direct-to-customer sales channels drive attractive net resale values that exceed those of our competitors who typically sell used equipment through auctions.
Growth Strategy 
We offer a full suite of specialty equipment services and a broad portfolio of products, which provides us with numerous channels for future growth and opportunities to deepen customer relationships. We intend to maintain our leading position and expand our market share by continuing to pursue the following strategies: 
Capitalize on Favorable Trends Across a Large Addressable Market - Because of the highly fragmented industry in which we operate, we have significant runway to increase our share of the market. We estimate the addressable market to be approximately $30 billion: $15.6 billion in new sales, $9 billion in aftermarket parts and service, and $5 billion in rental and used sales. The new sales addressable market has grown from an estimated $14.4 billion in 2016 to $15.6 billion in 2019. Our differentiated cost position, North American branch network, broad product offering, and flexible distribution model position us to achieve strong growth in the future. Additionally, several end markets we serve, including electric utility T&D, telecom, infrastructure, rail, and waste disposal, are expanding and spending on capital expenditures is increasing accordingly. Our production and customization capabilities will only serve to bolster our ability to meet the growing demand and changing landscapes in these end markets as we can nimbly adapt as necessary to capitalize on opportunities as they present themselves. 
Invest in Rental Fleet to Meet Growing Demand - We see continued opportunity to invest in our rental fleet to serve customer demand.

We believe that by investing in new products and adding to our rental fleet, we can continue to satisfy the growing specialty equipment needs of our customers across end-markets. We have the resources and capital structure necessary to capture incremental demand. Lastly, a large percentage of our rental fleet is currently focused on serving the electric utility T&D and telecom industries, but we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our fleet of specialty equipment tailored to serve the growing rail and infrastructure end-markets as well. 
Grow Equipment Sales Across both Current and New Customers, End Markets, and Product Offerings - We will be able to leverage our national and local sales approach to achieve growth in our existing customer base and across existing and newly entered product categories. We have identified several new product categories that we plan to expand into, where our experience and expertise in production, customization, and purchasing are expected to provide favorable returns. We will look to drive volume growth via continued equipment innovations and strategic selling initiatives. We are currently well positioned to capitalize on favorable trends across end markets, including grid updates and maintenance, build-out of renewable resources, 5G roll-out, and potential significant infrastructure spend. 
Increase Penetration of Aftermarket Parts and Service - Each full-service location provides certified test and repair services and an expanded product offering of both insulated and non-insulated tools. Today, we leverage our service technicians, including those dedicated to field service, to support our existing rental fleet and select customer-owned equipment. We see an opportunity to grow the size of the internal service organization and external service provider network to increase our ability to service customer-owned equipment. Additionally, we launched our e-commerce platform in 2020 to begin to sell proprietary Load King™ equipment parts and other targeted specialty equipment parts. 
Continue to Pursue Domestic Geographic Expansion - We operate more than 37 locations; however, broad sections of the United States and Canada are still outside of our primary operating area. In the past, we have expanded into new geographical markets through both strategic acquisitions and through internal growth. There is an opportunity for future expansion across the United States to support growth. Custom Truck has successfully opened five locations in geographic areas where there were no attractive acquisition targets, exemplifying the ability to expand our reach without the use of acquisitions. In addition to organic geographic expansion, we may opportunistically pursue acquisitions to expand our product and service offering and accelerate growth.

The Board of Directors receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company’s strategy for the recruitment, retention, and development of the Company’s employees. 
Legal Proceedings and Insurance
From time to time, we are subject to various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, the vast majority of which arise out of the ordinary course of business. The nature of our business is such that disputes related to vehicles and accidents occasionally arise. We assess these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise and it establishes reserves as and if required, based on its assessment of exposure. We have insurance policies to cover general liability, product, and workers’ compensation related claims. Management believes that none of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
