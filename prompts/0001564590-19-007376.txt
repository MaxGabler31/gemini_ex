 Item 1.Business
 Overview
 The principal business of Quorum Health Corporation and its subsidiaries is to provide hospital and outpatient healthcare services in our markets across the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or leased a diversified portfolio of 27 hospitals in rural and mid-sized markets, which are located in 14 states and have a total of 2,604 licensed beds. In addition, through Quorum Health Resources LLC (“QHR”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, we provide a wide range of hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services. Over 95% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were attributable to our hospital operations business and the remainder related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.
 Our company became an independent, publicly-traded company on April 29, 2016 upon the spin-off (“Spin-off”) of 38 hospitals, their affiliated facilities and QHR from Community Health Systems, Inc. (“CHS” or “Parent” when referring to the carve-out period prior to April 29, 2016). For terms of the spin-off and related financing transactions, including the transition services agreements between us and CHS, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — The Spin-Off.”
 As used in this report, the terms (“QHC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) refer to Quorum Health Corporation and its subsidiaries. Quorum Health Corporation is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2015 to facilitate our Spin-off from CHS as described below. All references within this Annual Report on Form 10-K to our financial statements, financial data and operating data refer to such data on a consolidated and combined basis unless otherwise noted. For a definition of consolidated and combined basis, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations.”
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated total net operating revenues of $1.9 billion, loss from operations of $71.0 million, loss before income taxes of $199.1 million, net loss of $198.2 million, net cash provided by operating activities of $39.5 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $126.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures of $150.6 million. For information regarding why the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures present useful information to investors and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”), see “Item 6 — Selected Financial Data.” Our loss before income taxes was impacted by: (1) $77.1 million of impairment related to our hospital operations business; (2) $18.7 million of net operating losses related to the closure of one hospital; (3) $20.8 million of net operating losses from the hospitals that we divested, which collectively includes three hospitals divested in 2018, five hospitals divested in 2017 and two hospitals in 2016; and (4) $128.1 million of interest expense and $120.0 million of cash interest payments made on our indebtedness. 
 We generate patient revenues from the healthcare services we provide at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient facilities. Our hospital services include general and acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, diagnostic services, obstetrics, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. We also generate revenues from the outpatient healthcare services we provide at both our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities, including physician practices, urgent care centers, imaging centers and surgery centers, which are located in the surrounding communities of our hospitals. We prioritize building and maintaining a strong presence in the communities where we operate. We continuously seek to improve our market share in each community by building patient loyalty to both our hospitals and physicians and by maintaining a strong reputation for quality of patient care. We are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services in 20 of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, which means we typically have less direct competition from other hospital companies for our hospital services. Some of our hospitals are located in markets that are adjacent to highly populated areas where the population, available workforce and demand for healthcare services are likely to continue to grow. Such factors could increase the demand for healthcare services from our facilities due to the close proximity of our hospitals and outpatient services facilities to these neighboring markets.
 We generate non-patient revenues from our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business. QHR is a leading provider of hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services in the United States. The clients of QHR are hospitals that are not affiliated with our hospital operations business that enter into contracts with us to receive these non-patient services. By managing and consulting with non-affiliated hospitals that are often located in similar markets as our owned and leased hospitals, we hope to benefit from the opportunity to build relationships and partnerships in these communities and to enhance our knowledge of overall U.S. market conditions beyond the markets in which we currently operate hospitals. In addition to our non-patient revenues from our QHR business, we generate other non-patient revenues, primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.

Our Hospital Operations Business
 Our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and acute inpatient and outpatient healthcare services to patients living in or traveling to the communities in which we are located. Each of our hospitals has a corporate board of directors, a board of trustees, or both (in all cases, the “hospital board”), which include members from the local community and the hospital’s medical staff. The hospital board oversees the operations of the hospital and is responsible for matters such as establishing and monitoring policies related to medical, professional and ethical practices at the hospital and also ensuring these practices conform to U.S. healthcare industry standards and regulatory requirements. Each of our hospitals has an active quality assurance program to monitor patient safety and quality of care standards at the hospital and its affiliated outpatient service facilities and to meet accreditation and other federal and state regulatory requirements. Our hospitals conduct patient satisfaction surveys and engage in other quality of care assessment activities that are reviewed and monitored by our senior and hospital management teams on a continuing basis as part of our initiatives to maintain a high-quality reputation in each of the communities we serve.
Our Hospital Management Advisory and Healthcare Consulting Services Business
 In addition to the healthcare services provided through our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities, we also operate QHR, a leader in hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services. 
 QHR’s primary services include:
  
• | Hospital Management Advisory and Operational Support. QHR provides hospital and other healthcare organization clients with operational, financial and strategic guidance, as well as interim senior level management when needed. As of December 31, 2018, QHR had contracts to provide management advisory services to 72 hospital clients located in 27 states with a total of approximately 4,400 licensed beds. As part of the services we provide, our hospital clients receive operations support from QHR corporate and regional management teams. This service benefits our hospital clients as a result of the broader experience of our QHR corporate and regional management teams in providing services to hospitals of all sizes in diverse markets throughout the United States. In addition, QHR promotes healthcare consulting services to hospital clients that do not receive services from its management advisory services business. QHR generates revenues from its consulting contracts by charging a consulting fee for its services based on the nature, scope and timeline of the services defined for each specific contract. During the year ended December 31, 2018, QHR had contracts during some or all of the year to provide healthcare consulting and other support services to 102 hospitals and other healthcare related clients located in 37 states with a total of approximately 8,800 licensed beds.

Business Strategy
 Our business strategy includes divesting underperforming hospitals, reducing our debt, refining our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins and increasing our market share in each of the communities we serve. We intend to grow our revenues and operating margins by expanding specialty care and outpatient service lines at our hospitals, primarily by recruiting talented physicians and medical staff. We continuously aim to manage our operating costs, primarily through the efficient management of staffing, medical specialist costs and medical supply inventory levels, with a continued focus on enhancing patient safety and quality of care. In addition, our business strategy includes investing capital in renovations, expansion, medical-related technology and equipment at our existing healthcare facilities.
 As part of our efforts to accomplish these goals, we operate our healthcare facilities in accordance with the following strategic objectives:
  
• | improve our financial results and position by refining our portfolio to include high-quality, profitable hospitals and outpatient service facilities through the sale or closure of underperforming hospitals;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strategically expand the breadth and capacity of the specialty care service lines and outpatient services we offer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhance patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction at our healthcare facilities; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the operating and financial performance of our hospital and clinical operations business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improve our Financial Results and Position by Refining Our Portfolio to Include High-Quality, Profitable Hospitals and Outpatient Service Facilities Through the Sale or Closure of Underperforming Hospitals 
 We perform an ongoing strategic review of our hospitals based upon an analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, market demographic and economic trends and capital allocation requirements. As part of this strategy, we intend to divest or close underperforming hospitals and outpatient service facilities which, in turn, will allow us to reduce our corporate indebtedness and refine our hospital portfolio to become a sustainable group of hospitals and outpatient service facilities with higher operating margins. We are pursuing divestiture or closure opportunities that align with this strategy. Since the Spin-off, we have divested or closed 11 of the 38 hospitals we original acquired from CHS. Our strategic review process is ongoing and we have targeted additional hospitals for divestiture with the intention of utilizing substantially all net proceeds to pay down our secured debt. For a discussion of our recent divestitures and closure activities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Recent Divestiture Activity.”
Strategically Expand the Breadth and Capacity of the Specialty Care Service Lines and Outpatient Services We Offer
 Each of our markets has unique healthcare needs and gaps in available specialty care service lines and we assess these needs on an ongoing basis to prioritize our recruitment efforts. We are focused on the execution of effective primary care and specialty care physician retention and recruitment programs, and additionally non-physician recruitment and retention programs, at each of our hospitals for the purpose of building and maintaining the confidence of community residents in the stability and breadth of medical treatment available to them locally through our healthcare facilities. We invest capital in new and existing specialty care service lines and medical technology at our hospitals to continuously improve and enhance the quality of care experienced by our patients and with the intent of reducing the potential migration of our patients and local community residents to competing in-market and out-of-market providers. We also invest capital to expand our outpatient service line offerings. We believe this widens the catchment area for our hospitals and is consistent with prevailing market drivers in the U.S. healthcare industry, including patient preference for a convenient medical treatment facility, physician preference toward the increased efficiency of utilizing non-hospital settings when available, and both patient and third-party payor preferences toward the typically lower cost of care in outpatient settings. In particular, we are targeting four specialties, which are orthopedics, general surgery, gastroenterology and non-invasive cardiology. We anticipate the addition of these services will bolster utilization and increase acuity of our services, as measured by case mix index and net revenues per adjusted admission.
Enhance Patient Safety, Quality of Care and Satisfaction at our Healthcare Facilities
 Clinical quality is a high priority for us. We have various programs that support our hospitals and outpatient service facilities to continuously improve the safety, quality of care and satisfaction of patients receiving services from us. As an example, we maintain active safety and quality training programs for our senior hospital management, chief nursing officers, quality control directors, physicians and other medical staff at our healthcare facilities. We also have programs that focus on sharing information among our hospital management teams to align best practices in medical treatment, operations and regulatory compliance. We seek to provide our hospitals with the infrastructure and technological capability to deliver high-quality care to patients. We believe measurements of patient, physician, medical staff and employee satisfaction provide important insight for our hospital leadership teams into the quality of care being administered to patients. Each of our hospitals conducts patient, physician, medical staff and employee satisfaction surveys to identify methods and opportunities for improving patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction. In addition, we have standardized many of our processes for documenting compliance with accreditation requirements and clinical best practices that have positive track records in leading to improved patient experiences at our healthcare facilities. For example, we established a baseline at 
 4

each of our hospitals in April 2013 for monitoring the Serious Safety Event Rate. As of September 30, 2018, we have reported 87% fewer serious safety events in comparison to our baseline in 2013.
 Improve the Operating and Financial Performance of our Hospital and Clinical Operations Business
 We intend to improve the operating and financial performance at each of our hospitals and outpatient service facilities through frequent and ongoing evaluation of our operations, focusing on hospital-specific strategic initiatives, growing revenues by expanding specialty care and outpatient service line offerings, controlling operating costs and aligning incentive compensation with operating and financial performance to reward our hospital management teams. In general, we believe our opportunities for improving operating and financial performance are hospital-specific and we intend to develop an operating and marketing strategy tailored to the individual community they serve. Our strategic initiatives and operating cost control efforts include tasks such as continuously focusing on revenue cycle management and collections, adhering to established protocols related to medical supplies utilization, monitoring medical staffing levels and reducing contract labor usage. We believe these efforts, in combination with other initiatives aimed at improving our operating and financial performance, should lead to improved cash flow generation for us in the future.
Competition
 The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other healthcare providers for patients. We utilize both employee and non-employee physicians at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities. Our non-employee physicians, in most cases, also provide services at healthcare facilities not owned by us. We seek to attract patients to our facilities by maintaining a reputation for high quality of care and patient satisfaction, providing convenient inpatient and outpatient settings for the delivery of healthcare services, and ensuring that we invest in technologically advanced medical equipment. Our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider. For example, plans with narrow network structures restrict the number of participating in-network provider plans and plans with tiered network structures impose higher cost-sharing obligations on patients who obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier.
 We are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services in 20 of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, which means we typically have less direct competition for our hospital services. Our hospitals face competition from out-of-market hospitals, including hospitals in urban areas that may have more comprehensive specialty care service lines, more advanced medical equipment and technology, more extensive medical research capabilities and resources or greater access to medical education programs. Patients in the markets where we operate hospitals may travel to out-of-market hospitals to seek medical treatment for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the need for services we do not offer or as a result of a physician referral. Patients who seek medical treatment from an out-of-market hospital may subsequently shift their preferences to that hospital for future healthcare services. We also face competition from other specialty care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that are not affiliated with us. Our hospitals and many of the hospitals with whom we compete engage in physician alignment strategies, which may include employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, and participating in Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) and, to the extent permitted by law, physician ownership of healthcare facilities. Consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts among payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies implemented by large employer groups and their affiliates may also affect our competitive position.
 In our markets where we are not the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, our primary competitor is generally a not-for-profit hospital. Not-for-profit hospitals are typically owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities that are financially supported by endowments and charitable contributions. Not-for-profit hospitals do not pay income or property taxes and are able to make capital investments without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded healthcare facilities and equipment and to offer more specialized healthcare services than those available at our hospitals. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify competitive pressures.
 The trend toward increasing clinical transparency and value-based purchasing within the U.S. healthcare industry may have an adverse impact on our competitive position and patient admissions volumes in ways that we are unable to predict. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), requires hospitals to publish or make available to the public their standard charges for healthcare services. In addition, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publicizes on its Hospital Compare website certain data submitted by hospitals in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, which includes individual hospital performance data related to quality of care measures and patient satisfaction surveys.

Our Competitive Strengths
 In the rural and mid-sized markets where we operate, we believe we have strengths in our hospital operations that differentiate us from our competitors, including our commitment and ability to respond to the demand for better access to high-quality patient care, improved patient experience through the entire treatment and billing process and continuous improvement in clinical quality. We believe our competitive strengths are summarized as follows:

• | strong presence in the communities we serve;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | geographically diversified hospital portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | track record of continuous improvement in clinical quality, safety and patient experience; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | dedicated and experienced management teams.
--+--------------------------------------------

Strong Presence in the Communities We Serve
 Our hospitals are the sole providers of general and acute hospital healthcare services in most of the markets we serve throughout the United States. These communities rely on our hospitals for access to quality healthcare services, as well as to make a positive societal and economic impact in their regions. Our hospitals are dedicated to providing local employment opportunities, engaging in local sponsorships and offering community health education through lecture programs, health fairs and screening events, among other forms of engagement. We believe that being the sole provider in many of our markets offers a competitive advantage; for example, certain of these hospitals receive more favorable reimbursement treatment by Medicare based on this distinction.
Geographically Diversified Hospital Portfolio
 We have a geographically diversified portfolio, which as of December 31, 2018 included 27 hospitals located across 14 states. Many of our hospitals operate in markets experiencing population growth. We believe our existing hospital portfolio is geographically well-positioned to adapt to ongoing changes in the U.S. healthcare industry and to respond to individual community needs related to healthcare services. 
Track Record of Continuous Improvement in Clinical Quality, Safety and Patient Experience
 We are committed to providing a high-quality and cost-effective healthcare experience for patients in collaboration with our physicians, medical staff and third-party payors. We have continued to see a reduction in our Serious Safety Events, as last reported through September 30, 2018, with an 87% reduction from our 2013 baseline. Our hospitals continually strive to achieve clinical excellence designations, such as Chest Pain Center accreditation by the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care and Primary Stroke Center accreditation by The Joint Commission.
Dedicated and Experienced Management Teams
 Our dedicated senior management team has significant public company, general healthcare and hospital operations experience, including a proven track record of improving operational performance, optimizing service lines and integrating hospitals. We believe the breadth of healthcare industry expertise and experience from both our senior management team and the management teams at each of our hospitals will drive our long-term growth.
U.S. Healthcare Industry
 Overview
 According to CMS, total U.S. healthcare expenditures in 2017 grew by 3.9% to approximately $3.5 trillion and are projected to have grown 4.5% in 2018 to approximately $3.6 trillion. The CMS projections, published in February of 2018, indicate that total U.S. healthcare spending will grow at an average annual rate of 5.5% for 2018 through 2027, exceeding $5.9 trillion by 2027 and accounting for approximately 19.4% of the total U.S. gross domestic product. CMS expects healthcare spending to be largely influenced by changes in economic conditions and demographics. The CMS projections are typically published once per year and are not updated to reflect interim changes.
 Hospital care, the category within the U.S. healthcare industry in which we classify our hospital operations business, is the largest category of U.S. healthcare expenditures. The hospital care category is broadly defined to include services provided at acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric healthcare facilities that are owned by the government or investors or that operate as not-for-profit facilities. CMS defines the hospital care category to include all services provided by hospitals to patients. Services include room and board, ancillary charges, services of employed physicians, inpatient pharmacy, hospital-based nursing home, home health care and any other service billed by hospitals in the United States for patient care. In 2018, hospital care expenditures are projected to have grown 4.4%, amounting to over $1.2 trillion. CMS estimates that the hospital services category will amount to nearly $1.3 trillion in 2019 and projects growth in this category at an average of 5.6% annually from 2018 through 2027. According to the American Hospital Association, as of January 2019, there are approximately 5,262 community hospitals in the United States and approximately 1,875 of these hospitals are located in rural communities, which are the primary markets in which we operate hospitals.
 6

Healthcare Reform
 The healthcare industry in the United States remains subject to continuing regulatory and market uncertainty due to recent reforms and reform proposals. The current presidential administration and certain members of Congress have sought to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act. In addition, governmental agencies and courts have narrowed the scope of the law’s reforms through subsequent interpretation. For example, Courts and government agencies could eliminate provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are beneficial to us and leave in effect provisions that reduce our reimbursement. In addition, government and private payors’ efforts to fundamentally change the finance and delivery of health care may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. For example, certain members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage of healthcare expenses, including single-payor proposals. Other industry groups, such as large employers and private payors and their affiliates, have also proposed reforms to the structure of private health insurance.
Demographic Trends 
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2016, the U.S. population included approximately 49.2 million people living in the United States age 65 or older, comprising 15.2% of the total U.S. population. By 2030, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts the number of people age 65 or older living in the United States will increase to approximately 73.1 million, or 20.6% of the total U.S. population. Due to increasing life expectancy, people living in the United States age 85 or older is also expected to increase from approximately 6.4 million in 2016 to 9.1 million by 2030. The increase in life expectancy is expected to increase the demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for more innovative means of delivering healthcare services.
 Based on U.S. Census Bureau data compiled by us for the specific markets in which we operate hospitals, the number of people living in our service areas declined 0.7% from 2010 to 2018 and is expected to decline 0.3% from 2018 to 2023. The national average population growth is 5.8% and 3.7% for these respective periods. The number of people age 65 or older living in our service areas grew 19.3% from 2010 to 2018 and is expected to grow 34.9% from 2018 to 2023. The national average population growth for people age 65 or older is 28.6% and 17.0% for these respective periods. The number of people age 65 or older living in our service areas comprised 16.3% of the total population in our service areas in 2018 and is expected to comprise 18.4% of the total population in these same service areas by 2023. The number of people age 65 or older living in the United States is 16.8% and 17.9% for these respective periods. On a similar basis, the number of people age 85 or older in our service areas grew 10.1% from 2010 to 2018 and is expected to grow 13.6% from 2018 to 2023. The national average population growth for people age 85 or older is 16.8% and 6.4% for these respective periods. The number of people age 85 or older living in our service areas comprised 2.0% of the total population in our service areas in 2018 and is expected to comprise 2.0% of the total population in these same service areas by 2023. The number of people age 85 or older living in the United States is 2.1% and 2.2% for these respective periods. 
 Hospital Consolidation Trends
 Various sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry are experiencing consolidation activity. We believe that consolidation activity in the hospital care category will continue to be a trend of the U.S. healthcare industry in the future. Reasons for this consolidation activity generally include the following:

• | desire to enhance the quality of care and breadth of local healthcare service lines available in communities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | need for additional recruitment of specialty care and primary care physicians or other medical staff;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economies of scale, such as those that can be achieved through contracting for medical and drug supply purchase agreements and professional and general liability insurance coverage as a combined hospital system;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing market share in the communities they serve;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | mitigating risks associated with ongoing changes in reimbursement rates available from both governmental and non-governmental third-party payors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes to healthcare reimbursement payment models that more closely tie reimbursement rates to the cost-effective delivery of patient services and the quality of care administered to patients; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other ongoing regulatory changes within the U.S. healthcare industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Hospital companies are acquiring an increasing number of physician practices and other outpatient service facilities as part of their physician alignment strategies to position themselves for readmissions, payment bundling and other payment restructuring models. Similarly, commercial and non-governmental managed care third-party payors have been consolidating and, in some cases, acquiring complementary service providers in an effort to offer more competitive programs.
 Payment Trends
 In recent years, the Affordable Care Act and the consolidation activity within the U.S. healthcare industry, among other factors, have resulted in higher deductible and co-payment requirements due from patients, which in turn have increased financial risk for hospitals. The amount of uncollectible patient account balances is expected to increase in response to rising medical prices and to greater financial burden on insured patients. These increases have been partially offset by the reduction in costs associated with 
 7

previously uninsured patients benefiting from Medicaid expansion due to the Affordable Care Act. However, it is unclear whether these effects will continue due to uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act and other health reform initiatives.
 Outpatient Services Trends
 In recent years, hospital companies have generally experienced an increase in the percentage of total revenues associated with outpatient healthcare services. This shift in revenues is primarily attributable to advances in medical technology, which have permitted more procedures to be performed in an outpatient setting. In addition, increased pressure from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, commercial health insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce the number of days a patient stays in the hospital has also contributed to the increase in outpatient healthcare services. Patients and third-party payors have been seeking lower cost service settings through outpatient service facilities on an increasing basis as the number of outpatient service facilities and the types of services available through outpatient service facilities increase. Certain third-party payors are imposing limitations and adjusting coverage of inpatient services for types of services currently available in outpatient settings. Further, recent changes to Medicare policy affecting the reimbursement methodology for certain items and services provided by off-campus provider-based hospital departments have generally resulted in reduced payment rates for hospital outpatient settings. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, outpatient healthcare services represented 55.9%, 55.0% and 55.4%, respectively, of our net patient revenues, before any implicit price concessions.
Health Insurance Coverage Trends
 The Affordable Care Act, as initially structured, mandated that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. In recent years, most of the states that have experienced the greatest reductions in rates of uninsured individuals have been those that expanded Medicaid coverage and established healthcare insurance exchanges at the state level. However, CMS has indicated that it intends to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including allowing states to condition Medicaid enrollment on work or other community engagement. Further, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act, making it difficult to predict future trends in health insurance coverage. The presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may impact the number of individuals who elect to purchase health insurance. In addition, the President signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially allowing for fewer plans that adhere to specific Affordable Care Act coverage mandates. Several private health insurers have limited their participation in or withdrawn from the healthcare insurance exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Government efforts to change, alter the implementation of, or repeal the Affordable Care Act, or otherwise influence financial and delivery systems within the healthcare industry, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.
Revenues
 Adoption of ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
 On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts existing on January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605. The key impacts on our consolidated financial statements include the following: 

• | Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, a significant portion of our allowance for doubtful accounts related to amounts due from self-pay patients, as well as co-pays and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. Under ASC 606, the estimated allowance for these patient accounts are generally considered a direct reduction to net operating revenues rather than as previously reported as provision for bad debts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, our presentation and disclosure of net revenue by payor included the portion of the revenue related to co-pays and deductibles as third-party revenues. Under ASC 606, the co-pays and deductibles portions of net revenue are classified as self-pay after insurance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue Recognition
 We generate revenues by providing healthcare services at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities to patients seeking medical treatment. Hospital revenues depend on, among other factors, inpatient occupancy and acuity levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated reimbursement rates for the healthcare services provided. Our primary sources of payment for patient healthcare services are third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, commercial insurance companies, other managed care programs, workers’ compensation carriers and employers. Self-pay and self-pay after insurance revenues are the portion of our revenues generated from providing healthcare services to patients who do not have health insurance coverage as well as the patient responsibility portion of charges that are not covered for an individual by a health insurance program or plan. We generate revenues related to our QHR business when hospital 
 8

management advisory and healthcare consulting services are provided. We generate other non-patient revenues primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.
 Amounts we collect for medical treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental third-party payors are generally less than our standard billing rates. Our standard charges and reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of medical procedure performed and the geographical location of the hospital. Differences in our standard billing rates and the amounts we expect to collect from third-party payors are classified as contractual adjustments. The reimbursements we ultimately receive as payments for services are determined for each patient instance of care, based on the contractual terms we negotiate with third-party payors or based on federal and state regulations related to governmental healthcare programs. Billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under transition services agreements (“TSAs”) that were put in place by CHS in connection with the Spin-off. Our contractual adjustments are impacted by the timing and ability of CHS to monitor the classification and collection of our patient accounts receivable. See Note 17 — Related Party Transactions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Except for emergency department services, our policy is to determine the payment methodology with patients prior to when the services are performed. Self-pay and other payor discounts are incentives offered to uninsured or underinsured patients or other payors to reduce their costs of healthcare services.
 The following table provides a summary of our net operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, by payor source (dollars in thousands):

 Revenues from Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs are included in Medicare and Medicaid revenues, respectively, in the table above. In addition, the table above includes a $21.0 million and a $22.8 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $21.0 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2017 was a result of our analysis of our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals as of December 31, 2017. The $22.8 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2016 was a result of increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program and the assessment of collectability of managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on our review of historical cash collections for these accounts.
 Reimbursement under Governmental Healthcare Programs
 We receive payments for a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare managed care plans, known as Medicare Advantage Plans, and the Medicaid managed care plans. Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance benefits to individuals age 65 and older, some disabled individuals and individuals with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal and state funded program, administered at the state level, which provides health insurance benefits and subsidies to individuals who are unable to afford to pay for healthcare services or health insurance on their own. All of our hospitals are certified as providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 The payments we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than the standard charges at our hospitals for the healthcare services provided. Furthermore, reimbursement payments under federally-funded healthcare programs are subject to across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. These sequestration cuts, as they are known, require reductions in reimbursement rates through federal fiscal year 2027. The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, also imposes significant reductions on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. The federal government updates reimbursement rates annually. Legislation or regulation may result in payment reductions in the Medicare or Medicaid programs that could negatively impact our business. Our ability to adapt to the ongoing regulatory changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs will be a significant factor in our ability to operate our hospitals and affiliated outpatient healthcare facilities successfully in the future. See “Item 1. Business — U.S. Healthcare Industry” for statistical information on U.S. population trends.

Medicare Reimbursement
 Under the Medicare program, we are paid for inpatient and outpatient healthcare services provided to qualifying Medicare beneficiaries at our hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Medicare is funded by the federal government under a series of individual programs. For example, the Part A program covers hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice care services and the Part B program covers physician services, preventive care, durable medical equipment, hospital outpatient services, laboratory tests, x-rays, mental health care and some home health and ambulance services. Medicare Advantage Plans, which is the customary term for the Part C program, are administered by private third-party payors that contract with the Medicare program to provide Medicare Part A and Part B benefits to participants. They include plans organized as health management organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), private fee-for-service plans, special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans. We are paid directly by the third-party payor that administers a Medicare Advantage Plan for the healthcare services we provide to patients enrolled in one of these plans. The regulations governing reimbursement under the Medicare program also generally apply to Medicare Advantage Plans.
 Inpatient Medicare Reimbursement. Reimbursement rates for inpatient acute care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are generally determined based on a prospective payment system. Under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”), our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount based on the patient’s diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a medical severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”) based upon the patient’s course of medical treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. The base MS-DRG payment rate does not consider the actual costs incurred by an individual hospital in providing a particular inpatient service. Each MS-DRG is assigned a relative weight that reflects the average amount of resources, as determined on a national basis, that are needed to treat a patient with that particular diagnosis compared to the amount of hospital resources that are needed to treat the average Medicare inpatient stay. The IPPS payment for each discharge is based on two national standardized base payment rates, one that covers hospital operating expenses and the other that covers hospital capital costs. The base MS-DRG payment rate for operating expenses is adjusted by a wage index to reflect geographical differences in labor costs. While a hospital generally does not receive additional reimbursement beyond the MS-DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an “outlier” payment when a patient’s medical treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold.
 CMS adjusts the MS-DRG payment rates annually, using the “market basket index” to account for changes to the costs of goods and services purchased by hospitals. For federal fiscal year 2019, which began on October 1, 2018, CMS increased the reimbursement rate by approximately 1.85% for hospitals that successfully report the quality measures of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (“IQR”) Program and are meaningful EHR users. This rate increase accounts for a projected market basket update of 2.9% and a 0.5% adjustment required by legislation which are negatively adjusted by the following percentage points: 0.8 for the multi-factor productivity measure and 0.75 as required by the Affordable Care Act. Hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program are subject to a 25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that are not meaningful EHR users are subject to an additional 75% reduction of the market basket update. Based on our current portfolio, we estimate that the CMS payment rate changes indicated above will increase our inpatient Medicare reimbursement by $4.7 million in 2019.
 The DRG payment rates are also adjusted pursuant to provisions of the Affordable Care Act that promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. For example, hospitals that meet or exceed defined quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement, while hospitals that do not satisfy the quality performance standards may receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospital’s own past performance. Similarly, hospitals that experience “excess readmissions” for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days of the patient’s date of discharge receive inpatient payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospital’s readmission performance to the readmission performance of hospitals in one of five peer groups. In addition, CMS incentivizes hospitals to improve Hospital Acquired Condition (“HAC”) rates by reducing total inpatient Medicare payments by 1% for hospitals that rank among the lowest-performing 25% with respect to HACs. 
 Outpatient Medicare Reimbursement. CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients without Part A coverage) under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”). Other items and services, such as physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, and clinical diagnostic laboratory services, are reimbursed pursuant to fee schedules.
 Hospital outpatient services paid under the OPPS are grouped into ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. CMS has established a payment rate for each APC, and it updates these rates annually on a calendar year basis. For calendar year 2019, CMS issued a final rule that it estimates will result in a 1.35% payment increase for hospitals paid under the OPPS. This reflects a market basket increase of 2.9%, with a negative 0.8 percentage point multi-factor productivity adjustment and the 0.75 percentage point reduction required by the Affordable Care Act, along with other policy changes. For calendar year 2019, these policy changes include an update to ASC payment rates to be based on the hospital market basket rate as opposed to the CPI-U for calendar years 2019-2023. CMS also is updating ASC rates for calendar year 2019 by 2.1%. This change will help promote site neutrality between hospitals and ASCs. In addition to these broad OPPS-wide adjustments, hospitals that fail to meet quality data reporting requirements are subject to a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market 
 10

basket update. Based on our current portfolio, we estimate that the cumulative changes to OPPS payments will increase our outpatient Medicare reimbursement by $1.5 million in 2019.
 CMS has implemented a site-neutral Medicare reimbursement policy that limits reimbursement under the OPPS for items and services that are provided at certain off-campus outpatient provider-based departments (“off-campus OPBDs”) of hospitals. Items and services that are subject to the policy are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). However, the site-neutral payment policy does not apply to items and services rendered in a dedicated emergency department. Further, with the exception of clinic visits, the site neutral policy does not apply to items or services furnished at off-campus OPBDs that are located within 250 yards of a remote location of a hospital, or to grandfathered off-campus OPBDs, which include those that were billing Medicare for outpatient hospital services prior to November 2, 2015.
 Medicare Bundled Payments. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which is part of CMS, works to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare services that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. Some of the current and proposed initiatives involve bundled payments, which link payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. Generally, providers participating in a bundled payment arrangement agree to receive one payment for services provided to patients for certain medical conditions or during each episode of care. In contrast to the traditional fee-for-service model, bundled payments are intended to align incentives for providers, encouraging more effective and efficient care.
 Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS requires hospitals located in certain geographic areas to participate in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, a mandatory bundled payment initiative focused on knee and hip replacements. We operate one hospital within the geographical areas currently being tested. CMS has indicated that it is developing more bundled payment models. Our experience to date with the CJR model has not materially impacted our overall financial statements.
 Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program. The Medicare program also makes reimbursement rate adjustments under a Medicare-Dependent Hospital program that applies to low admission volume hospitals, referred to as rural extenders, to ensure hospital access for rural Medicare beneficiaries. The budget bill signed into law in February 2018 extended the Medicare-Dependent Hospital program through federal fiscal year 2022. If future legislation is not passed to further extend the Medicare-Dependent Hospital program, we could experience a reduction in our net operating revenues at certain of our hospitals that currently qualify for participation in this program.
 Medicare Physician Services Payments. Physician services provided to Medicare patients are reimbursed based on the MPFS, which is adjusted annually based on certain factors. Under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), one of those factors is an adjustment factor of 0.5%. MACRA also established the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians are required to participate in the QPP through one of two tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in 2017 will affect Medicare payments in 2019 and performance data collected in 2018 will affect payments in 2020. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS, such as certain ACO models or a Medicare Shared Savings Program. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment between 2019 and 2024 and will be exempt from reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) if the provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Providers who choose the MIPS track initially will be subject to a performance-based reimbursement rate increase or decrease of up to 4% of the provider’s Medicare payments based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities and meaningful use of EHR. The adjustment percentage will increase incrementally, up to 9%, by 2022. MIPS consolidated components of three previously established incentive programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program.
 Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments. In addition to making payments related to specific patient services, Medicare provides financial support to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients. These Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payments are determined annually based on statistical information required by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and are paid as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments. The Affordable Care Act reduced Medicare DSH payments to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would have been paid is earmarked for an uncompensated care payment pool that is adjusted each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the rate of coverage for the previously uninsured population, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is then paid, out of the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. The IPPS final rules for federal fiscal years 2019 and 2018 established the uncompensated care amounts to be distributed to qualifying hospitals in these years as nearly $8.3 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. Medicare DSH payments received in the aggregate by our hospitals for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $10.3 million, $8.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively. We estimate the amount to be received for 2019 to be approximately $9.9 million.
 11

Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) in 12 defined jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Medicare Part A and Part B providers within its given jurisdiction. In connection with past consolidation efforts, CMS gave chain providers the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC. Although we elected to use one MAC, CMS has not yet transitioned all of our hospitals to one MAC and has not provided a clear timeline for doing so. MAC transitions impact Medicare claims processing, which could delay reimbursement payments and adversely affect our cash flow. MAC transitions may also be prompted by the periodic re-soliciting by CMS of MAC bids in a jurisdiction.
 Medicaid Reimbursement
 Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states to provide healthcare benefits to certain low-income individuals. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a prospective payment system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid programs are often significantly less than the hospital’s standard charges for the services provided. State Medicaid agencies may also fund Medicaid Managed Care Plans, which provide for the delivery of Medicaid health benefits and additional services through contracted arrangements between state Medicaid agencies and managed care organizations (MCOs) that accept a set per member per month payment for these services. We are paid directly by the MCO for the healthcare services we provide to patients enrolled in one of these plans. The regulations that govern the reimbursement rates of the Medicaid programs also generally apply to Medicaid managed care plans. 
 The Affordable Care Act requires states to expand Medicaid coverage by adjusting eligibility requirements such as income thresholds. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. Seven of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals have expanded coverage under their state Medicaid programs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities located in these seven states generated 76.5% of our total net patient revenues, before implicit price concessions, excluding our divested hospitals and affiliated outpatient services facilities. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act, including its Medicaid expansion provisions. In addition, budget pressures have prompted many states to consider reducing Medicaid funding, as Medicaid is often the state’s largest program. Some states have adopted or are considering legislation intended to reduce coverage, increase enrollment in managed care programs or otherwise finance the system. Several states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS has indicated that it intends to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including approving waivers that allow states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement. However, the Affordable Care Act, as enacted, requires that states maintain certain eligibility standards for children until October 1, 2019. The Affordable Care Act also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to patients to treat HACs. 
 Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital and Supplemental Payments. Currently, most states, including 13 of the 14 states in which we operate, utilize supplemental payment programs, including disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) programs, for the purpose of providing additional payments for services to providers, such as our hospitals, to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and funded with a combination of federal and state resources, including, in certain states, taxes, fees or other program costs (collectively, “provider taxes”) levied on the providers participating in the programs. Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. States then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals, as determined in each state. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. Under the budget bill signed into law in February 2018, Medicaid DSH funding will be reduced by $4 billion in federal fiscal year 2020 and by $8 billion per year in federal fiscal years 2021 through 2025. In addition to DSH payments, some states operate programs that provide for supplemental payments to bridge the gap between hospital operating costs and Medicare reimbursement. Various federal policy changes are focused on limiting the use of other types of supplemental payments. For example, CMS began limiting “pass-through payments” to Medicaid managed care plans in 2016 and will ultimately prohibit such payments by 2027.
 We recognize the reimbursement payments due to us from state supplemental payment programs in the periods amounts are estimable and revenue collection is reasonably assured. These amounts are recorded in operating revenues as favorable contractual allowances and the costs we incur under these programs are recorded as other operating expenses.

 Several states in which we operate face budgetary challenges that have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Continuing pressure on state budgets and other factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments, payment delays or additional provider taxes being assessed on hospitals participating in these programs.

 The California Department of Health Care Services implemented the Hospital Quality Assurance Fee (“HQAF”) program, imposing a fee on certain general and acute care California hospitals. Revenues generated from these fees provide funding for the non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California’s Medicaid (“Medi-Cal”) and uninsured patients. Under this program we recognized $25.9 million, $22.0 million and $34.4 million of operating revenues, net of provider taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in the table above.
 TRICARE
 TRICARE is the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for members of the armed forces. Under the TRICARE program, hospitals and other healthcare providers are reimbursed for healthcare services provided to qualifying patients using an inpatient DRG-based payment system and an outpatient prospective payment system similar to those used to make reimbursement payments under the Medicare program.
 Reimbursement under Non-Governmental Plans and Programs
 Managed Care and Commercial Plans 
 In addition to governmental healthcare reimbursement programs, we are paid for a portion of the healthcare services we provide to patients by private third-party payors, including commercial health insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, other managed care companies, workers’ compensation carriers and employers. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between the standard charges for our services and the contracted payment amounts that we receive from non-government third-party payors, but are responsible for the portions of the payment for services that are not covered by programs or plans under contract. These amounts generally consist of the deductibles and co-payment obligations of their coverage. The deductible and co-payment obligations due 
 13

from patients, which we include in the self-pay payor category, have increased in recent years in response to the increasing numbers of individuals and employers who purchase insurance plans with high deductibles and high co-payments. 
 Commercial health insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies generally attempt to manage their costs by seeking discounted fee structures or fixed fee charge arrangements with providers to reduce their payouts below the provider’s standard charges or the charges initially billed to them. They also utilize other strategies, such as narrowing the provider options in their networks, to restrict the pool of providers that insured patients may utilize under their coverage. Consolidation within the payor industry, including vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies imposed by large employer groups and their affiliates may increase these challenges. To remain competitive, we actively engage in the negotiation of discounts or fixed fee charge arrangements with commercial health insurance and other private managed care companies. The negotiated discounts and fixed fee charge arrangements are typically less than the reductions in reimbursement rates imposed on us by governmental payors. If an increasing number of private third-party payors succeed in negotiating discounted or fixed fee structures with us or if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contractual terms with these payors and therefore do not participate in some or all of the commercial health insurance and managed care networks in our markets, our results of operations or cash flows may be adversely impacted. 
 Under current law, commercial health insurance companies that participate on the health care exchanges (the “Exchanges”), which were established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, are required to offer a set of minimum coverage benefits and a minimum number of levels of plans that vary depending on the percentage of total premium costs to be paid by the insured individual. Our hospitals participate in the provider networks of various insurers offering plan options on the Exchanges. However, in 2017, the President signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially permitting the sale of short-term health insurance plans and coverage that does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s minimum requirements. In addition, several insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the Exchanges, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces.
 Accountable Care Organizations
 With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs are gaining traction in both the public and private sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry. An ACO is a network of providers, including hospitals, physicians and other designated healthcare-related professionals, which work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency initiatives. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program that seeks to promote accountability through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion in determining key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. 
The Affordable Care Act
 The Affordable Care Act, as initially structured, mandated that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. However, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the future of the Affordable Care Act, as the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the law, its implementation and its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, in June 2018, the Department of Labor issued a final rule expanding availability of association health plans, which are not required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. This change may result in individuals purchasing less comprehensive coverage. In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the Exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Further, in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas issued a decision finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, Texas v. U.S., N.D. Tex., No. 4:18-cv-00167 (Dec. 14, 2017). While the decision is expected to be appealed, it creates further uncertainty about the future of the law.
 California 2017-2019 Hospital Quality Assurance Fee Program
 The HQAF program provides funding for supplemental payments to hospitals that serve Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. Revenues generated from fees assessed on certain general and acute care California hospitals fund the non-federal supplemental payments to California’s safety-net hospitals while drawing down federal matching funds that are issued as supplemental payments to hospitals for care of Medi-Cal patients. In November 2016, California voters approved a state constitutional amendment measure that extends indefinitely the statute that imposes fees on California hospitals seeking federal matching funds.
 The fourth phase of the HQAF program expired on December 31, 2016. The California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) submitted the Phase V HQAF program package to CMS on March 30, 2017 for approval of the overall program structure and the fees or provider tax rates for the program period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, and the fee-for-service inpatient and 
 14

outpatient upper payments limits (“UPL”) for each of the state fiscal years in the period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019. CMS issued formal approval of Phase V HQAF on December 15, 2017. The approvals included the inpatient and outpatient fee-for-service supplemental payments and the overall tax structure. The California Hospital Association will work with the DHCS to develop an implementation schedule and update the draft model to reflect the CMS-approved amounts. However, CMS has not yet issued a decision on the managed care components of the Phase V HQAF program and, therefore, the payment amounts in the draft model are preliminary. Furthermore, the supplemental Medi-Cal managed care payments made through the new directed payment mechanism have been estimated using inpatient utilization data publicly reported to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development for the fiscal year ending in 2015. However, in actuality, the directed payments will be made for inpatient and outpatient services provided to in-network patients during the current state fiscal year. Phase V of California’s HQAF program expires on June 30, 2019. Although a state constitutional amendment indefinitely extended the program, CMS is required to approve the next phase of the program, Phase VI, which begins July 1, 2019 and is expected to be 24 to 36 months, but is unknown at this time. The CMS approval process can be lengthy, and we are unable to recognize revenue until CMS approves each phase of the program. We cannot provide any assurances of the amount of revenues our hospitals may receive from or the timing of CMS’ approval of the next phase of the HQAF program, the timing of the related cash flows, or that the program will be approved at all.
 Of the total supplemental payments received by all hospitals, our portion represents 0.50%. We are estimating that our net impact over the 30-month period will be $56.8 million. While uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of payments under the HQAF program exist, our estimates of future cash collections at this time, net of any provider taxes, including those related to previous programs, are $22.3 million in 2019, $12.7 million in 2020 and $7.7 million in 2021.
 Illinois 2018 Hospital Assessment Program Redesign
 The Illinois Hospital Assessment program provides funding for supplemental payments to hospitals, particularly those that serve higher proportions of Medicaid and uninsured patients in Illinois. Revenues generated from fees assessed on certain general and acute care Illinois hospitals draw down federal matching funds that are issued as supplemental payments to hospitals for care of Medicaid patients. The program was redesigned to modernize payment methodologies and satisfy certain CMS requirements. The “new” program received CMS approval to begin effective July 1, 2018. Among other changes, the program includes updated base year data and requires a greater percentage of funds to hospitals to be delivered at the paid claims level rather than through lump sum payments. 
 According to the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, the total funding available to hospitals under the redesigned program will approximate the old program. However, funding allocations may vary with the updated base year data and other changes in payment methodology. The most recent models provided by the Illinois Health and Hospital Association show our hospital payments being reduced by approximately $7.9 million annually.
 Other Government Laws and Regulations
 Licensure, Certifications and Accreditations
 Hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to laws and regulations regarding licensing, certification or accreditation, and may be subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local governmental agencies evaluating compliance and performance with such requirements. In addition, healthcare providers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in order to continue to qualify for participation in these programs. 
 Regulations imposed on healthcare facilities for licensure, certification and accreditation address compliance areas such as the following:
  
• | the adequacy of medical care, equipment and staff;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | operating policies and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------


• | billing and coding for services, including classifying the acuity level of care provided;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proper handling of reimbursement overpayments;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | preparing and filing of Medicare and Medicaid annual cost reports;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | relationships between referral sources and recipients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining adequate compliance records;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | utilization reviews of services provided at our facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | standard charges for patient services;
--+---------------------------------------


• | compliance with building codes;
--+--------------------------------


• | environmental protection; and
--+------------------------------


• | patient privacy and security.
--+------------------------------

Failure to comply with applicable licensure, certification, and accreditation standards may result in criminal penalties, civil sanctions, loss of operating licenses, or restrictions on our ability to participate in certain government programs. All of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities are currently licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in both federal and state Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 Federal and state governments have enacted various laws intended to prevent and reduce healthcare fraud and abuse, which continue to be a top enforcement priority. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index and were recently increased under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
 Federal False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits knowingly making false claims or statements to the U.S. government, including submitting false claims for reimbursement under government programs. The FCA broadly defines the term “knowingly.” Although simple negligence does not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute “knowingly” submitting a false claim and result in liability. The FCA can be used to prosecute fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, and submitting false cost reports. Its reach extends to payments involving federal funds in connection with the Exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. Violations of other statutes, such as the Stark Law and Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can serve as a basis for liability under the FCA.
 Among the potential bases for liability under the FCA are knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and knowingly failing to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding annual cost report is due, whichever is later. Overpayments are deemed to have been “identified” when a provider has, or should have, through reasonable diligence determined that a reimbursement overpayment was received and quantified such overpayment.
 A provider that is determined to be liable under the FCA is required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the federal government, plus a substantial mandatory civil penalty for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe calculation of damages. The FCA also contains “qui tam” or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to file a complaint or otherwise report actions alleging the defrauding of the federal government by a provider. If the federal government intervenes, the individual that filed the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the federal government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue its allegation independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private individual brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally is not made aware of the lawsuit until the federal government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene.
 Any provider that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid reimbursement payments is required to distribute and make available to all employees, contractors and any other agents detailed information about its policies related to false claims, false statements and whistleblower protection under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws.
 Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“Anti-Kickback Statute”), a subsection of the Social Security Act, makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce patient referrals or business that is reimbursable under any federal healthcare program. Violations under the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs and the imposition of criminal and civil fines, including the payment of damages up to three times the total dollar amount involved. The civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Further, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false claim under the FCA.
 The HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs. As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG has published regulations that set forth “safe harbors” protecting certain payment and business practices, outlining activities and business relationships that are deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by the OIG or other governmental enforcement agencies.
 The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as presenting a substantial risk of fraud and abuse, and, if the requisite intent is present, could therefore violate the Anti-Kickback Statute:
  
• | payment of any incentive by a hospital to a physician when the physician makes a patient referral to the hospital or to a healthcare facility that benefits the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment to physicians to entice them to locate in close
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16

 
proximity to the hospital;
--------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other medical and administrative staffing services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free training for a physician or a physician’s medical and office staff, including management and laboratory training, but excluding compliance training;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of guarantees that provide that if a physician’s income falls below a predetermined level, the hospital will pay the remainder to them;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans that may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment for services to a physician, in which such services require few, if any, substantive duties to be performed by the physician or that are in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coverage of a physician on the hospital’s group health insurance plan at an inappropriately low cost to the physician;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchases from a physician made by a hospital for goods and services at prices in excess of their fair market value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rental of space to physicians at prices below fair market value; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engaging in relationships with physician-owned entities, often referred to as physician-owned distributorships (“PODs”), which derive revenues from the sale or arrangement for sale of implantable medical devices whereby the physician orders such medical devices and then uses them for their own patients in surgeries or procedures performed at the hospital or other outpatient service facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a variety of financial arrangements with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in some of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation packages, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans. Although we strive to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, taking into account available guidance from the OIG including the “safe harbor” regulations, we cannot make assurances that the OIG or other regulatory agencies may not view a financial arrangement as a potential violation. If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties or may become excluded from eligibility to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs.
 The Stark Law
 The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements if the entity provides certain “designated health services.” These types of referrals are commonly known as “self-referrals.” The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid from billing these programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services.
 Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of reimbursement payments under federal healthcare programs, substantial civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Stark Law provides for a penalty of up to $161,692 for engaging in activities intended to circumvent the Stark Law prohibitions. These civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibitions under the Stark Law. For example, one exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if such entity is located in a rural area, as defined under the Stark Law. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, the federal government has issued regulations that interpret the provisions included in the Stark Law.
 Another Stark Law exception, known as the “whole hospital” exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds stock, debt or other types of investment arrangements in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly traded securities that meet certain conditions. CMS regulations impose various restrictions and disclosure requirements on physician-owned hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request to the public. Each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospital’s medical staff must agree, as a condition of their inclusion on the medical staff and their admitting privileges at the hospital, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their ownership interest, or an immediate family members’ ownership interest, in the hospital. 
 17

The Affordable Care Act narrowed the “whole hospital” exception to the Stark Law. Although existing physician investments in a whole hospital may continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital from the percentage that existed as of March 23, 2010. In addition, the Affordable Care Act restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the aggregate number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds beyond that for which the hospital was licensed as of March 23, 2010. If a physician-owned hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could be required to repay Medicare payments related to referrals from its physician investors and possibly lose its Medicare provider agreement and be unable to participate in Medicare. Tracking the required elements of the “whole hospital exception” is critical to maintaining these entities in compliance with the Stark Law.
 Other Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Under various federal laws and regulations, any individual or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including both governmental and private healthcare programs and plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”) imposes substantial civil penalties on providers that, for example, knowingly present or cause to be presented a claim for services not provided as claimed, offer remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a healthcare provider, or bill Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges. Notably, the CMP Law requires a lower burden of proof than some other fraud and abuse laws. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including engaging in certain gainsharing arrangements or contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal healthcare program. 
 Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from federal healthcare programs any investors, officers, and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud, even if those individuals had no knowledge of the fraud.
 State Laws
 A number of states, including states in which we operate hospitals, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private individual or entity may file a civil lawsuit in a state court. Federal laws provide an incentive to states to enact false claims laws at the state level that are comparable to the FCA.
 In addition, many states in which we operate have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payor for the healthcare services provided. These statutes at the state level typically include criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure, for violations. There is little precedent for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
 Program Integrity
 CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection efforts to identify improper reimbursement payments. Most non-governmental managed care programs require similar utilization reviews. Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”), for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for the delivery of healthcare goods and services to Medicare beneficiaries that are considered reasonable and necessary courses of treatment and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Among other responsibilities, QIOs are tasked with conducting short stay inpatient hospital reviews to evaluate compliance with the two midnight rule. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with Medicare payment policies may be referred by a QIO to a Recovery Audit Contractor.
 Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with third parties nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis, based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS recently reduced the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year.
 The RAC program’s scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform reviews and post-payment audits of Medicaid claims to identify potential overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic jurisdictions within the United States. Besides MICs, other approved contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities of Medicaid payments.
 We maintain policies and procedures to respond to RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.

Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2017 was approximately three years. To ease the backlog of appeals, CMS has announced two new settlement initiatives.
 Annual Cost Reports
 Hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. MS-DRG outlier payments have been and continue to be a subject of CMS audit and adjustment. The OIG is also actively engaged in audits and investigations into alleged abuses of the MS-DRG outlier payment system. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded net favorable (unfavorable) contractual allowance adjustments in net operating revenues of $(0.3) million, $2.0 million and $(5.8) million, respectively, related to previous program reimbursement estimates and final cost report settlements.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) Administrative Simplification provisions and their implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain healthcare claims and transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the U.S. healthcare industry. HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction.
 HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and implementing regulations extensively regulate the use, disclosure, confidentiality, availability and integrity of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and provide for a number of individual rights with respect to such information. These requirements apply to health plans and most health care providers, which are known as “covered entities.” Vendors, known as “business associates,” that handle protected health information, on behalf of covered entities must also comply with most HIPAA requirements. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. In order to comply with HIPAA, covered entities must, among other things, maintain privacy and security policies, train workforce members, maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, enter into confidentiality agreements with business associates, and permit individuals to access and amend their protected health information. In addition, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured (unencrypted) protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery date of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to report on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised. 
 HIPAA violations may result in criminal penalties and substantial civil penalties per violation. These civil penalties are subject to annual updates to reflect changes to the consumer price index. State attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages up to $25,000 for violations of the same requirement in a calendar year in response to HIPAA violations that affect their state residents. HHS has the discretion in many cases to resolve HIPAA violations through informal means without the imposition of penalties. However, HHS is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect and can and has imposed significant penalties. HHS also conducts compliance audits, which could lead to further compliance reviews or to enforcement actions. 
 Our healthcare facilities continue to remain subject to other applicable federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, which could result in additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities whose inadequate data security programs may expose consumers to fraud, identity theft and privacy intrusions, including the security programs of entities subject to HIPAA regulation. Various state laws and regulations require entities that maintain individually identifiable information (even if not health-related) to report data breaches to affected individuals and, in some cases, state regulators. In connection with our corporate compliance program, we have implemented a comprehensive set of privacy and security policies and procedures. We expect compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and security standards to continue to impose significant costs on our hospitals and operations.
 State Certificate of Need Laws
 In some states where we operate hospitals and outpatient service facilities, the construction or expansion of healthcare facilities, the acquisition of healthcare facilities, the transfer or change of ownership related to healthcare facilities and the addition of new licensed beds or healthcare service lines at healthcare facilities may be subject to review, prior approval or notification with a state regulatory agency under a certificate of need (“CON”) program. Such laws are generally in place for the reviewing state regulatory agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services in a specific market. As of December 
 19

31, 2018, we operated 19 hospitals in 9 states that have adopted CON programs. See “Item 2. Properties” for a table that denotes the states where we operate hospitals in which CON programs are present. The failure to provide required notification and obtain necessary approval in states having a CON program can result in the inability to expand, acquire or change ownership related to healthcare facilities in a particular market. Violations of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a hospital’s licenses. 
 In addition, some states in which we operate do not require a CON for the purchase, construction or expansion of healthcare facilities or services. Additionally, from time to time, statutes with existing requirements may repeal or limit the scope of the CON programs for future entry. In these cases, our competing healthcare providers could face lower barriers to entry and expansion into certain states where we operate hospitals. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 8 hospitals in 5 states that have not adopted CON programs.
 Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
 Some states have adopted laws that prohibit unlicensed individuals or business entities from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit unlicensed individuals or business entities from making direct or indirect payments to physicians or that prohibit these parties from engaging in fee-splitting arrangements. Physicians that violate these laws are subject to sanctions, including loss of licensure, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. Laws, such as these, vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or state regulatory agencies. We structure our arrangements with employed physicians to comply with the state laws where we operate. We can give no assurance that governmental agencies responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we are in violation of these laws. These laws could also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations. See “—Employees and Medical Staff — Physicians” below for additional information on our employed physicians.
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual that enters the hospital’s emergency department seeking treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition, including active labor, requires the hospital to either stabilize the patient’s condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another healthcare facility that can handle the condition. The obligation of the hospital to examine and stabilize emergency medical conditions or otherwise make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another suitable healthcare facility exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. Outpatient service facilities that lack emergency departments or otherwise do not treat emergency medical conditions are not generally subject to EMTALA; however, they are required to have policies and procedures that address the handling of situations in which an individual presents at their facility seeking emergency medical treatment, such as transferring the patient to the closest hospital with an emergency department. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition to these penalties, a harmed patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil lawsuit against that other hospital.
Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform
 Laws related to medical malpractice liability have historically been maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical malpractice liability lawsuits. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in medical malpractice lawsuits and many states have established caps on the damage awards or attorney fees permissible in such lawsuits. Recently, many states have introduced legislation to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Medical malpractice reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
Supply Contracts
 We purchase medical supplies, equipment, pharmaceuticals and certain other items under an agreement with a group purchasing organization (“GPO”) that covers all of our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities. By participating in a group purchasing organization, we believe that we can procure items at more competitively priced rates than we would pay for similar items without such agreement. In addition, we provide a service opportunity to our QHR hospital clients to contract with us for purchases that we make on their behalf under the terms of our agreement with this group purchasing organization.

Agreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off
 In connection with the Spin-off and effective as of April 29, 2016, we entered into certain agreements with CHS that allocated between us and CHS the various assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) that were previously part of CHS. In addition, these agreements govern certain relationships and activities between us and CHS for a definitive period of time after the Spin-off date, as specified by each individual agreement.
 A summary of these agreements follows:
  
• | Separation and Distribution Agreement. This agreement governed the principal actions of both QHC and CHS that needed to be taken to effect the Spin-off. It sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of our relationship with CHS following the Spin-off.

• | Employee Matters Agreement. This agreement governs certain compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the employees and non-employee directors of QHC and CHS. It also allocated liabilities and responsibilities relating to employment matters, employee compensation, employee benefit plans and other related matters as of the Spin-off date.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the agreements referenced above, we entered into certain transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements with CHS defining agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to certain or all of our hospitals, as determined by each agreement, commencing on the Spin-off date. The agreements generally have terms of five years.
 A summary of the major transition services agreements follows:
  
• | Shared Service Centers Transition Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS related to billing and collections utilizing CHS shared services centers. Services include, but are not limited to, billing and receivables management, statement processing, denials management, cash posting, patient customer service, and credit balance and other account research. In addition, it provides for patient pre-arrival services, including pre-registration, insurance verification, scheduling and charge estimates. Fees are based on a percentage of cash collections each month.

• | Receivables Collection Agreement (“PASI”). This agreement defined services to be provided by CHS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, PASI, which served as a third-party collection agency to us related to accounts receivable collections of both active and bad debt accounts of QHC hospitals, including both receivables that existed as of the Spin-off date and those that occurred during the operating period since the Spin-off date. Services included, but were not limited to, self-pay collections, insurance follow-up, collection letters and calls, payment arrangements, payment posting, dispute resolution and credit balance research. Fees were based on the type of service and were calculated based on a percentage of recoveries. Effective October 1, 2018, by mutual agreement of both companies, each of the parties’ obligations under this transition services agreement to the other were terminated. We replaced the services provided by CHS with external service providers and internal resources.

employees responsible for screening patients for program eligibility were transferred to QHC, which terminated the obligations of both parties under this transition services agreement.

 We recorded total expenses under transition services agreements with CHS following the Spin-off combined with the allocations from CHS for these same services prior to the Spin-off of $51.2 million, $63.5 million and $66.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. CHS initiated arbitration proceedings against us in regard to fees they alleged were due to them under the SSC TSA, and we filed counterclaims for damages related to CHS’s performance of the TSAs and other claims. In January 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final award which resolved our dispute with CHS related to the transition services agreements. For additional information regarding our arbitration with CHS, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Commercial Litigation and Other Lawsuits.”
 Compliance Program
 We recognize that our compliance with laws and regulations impacting our business depends on individual employee actions as well as company-wide operations. We adopted a compliance program following the Spin-off for our entire business (the “Compliance Program”). Our Compliance Program focuses on aligning compliance responsibilities with operational functions and is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business. Our hospital and corporate office management teams manage and oversee compliance among the employees within our hospitals and outpatient services facilities, QHR and all other departments within our company.
 Our Compliance Program contains the following requirements, among others:
  
• | oversight of management at all levels;
--+---------------------------------------


• | a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”);
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | policies and procedures that address specific risk areas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | employee education and training programs;
--+------------------------------------------


• | an internal system available to employees and affiliates to report concerns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | auditing and monitoring programs; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | policies related to the enforcement of the Compliance Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the above, our Compliance Program includes policies and procedures related to the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security. It also includes procedures specific to claims preparation and submission, including procedures for coding, billing and annual cost reports. It addresses policies related to financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, compliance with the FCA, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. The program includes policies specific to our compliance with EMTALA related to the treatment of hospital emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay. We continuously review our Compliance Program and make necessary updates or changes to be compliant with new laws and regulations or industry standards impacting our business.
 Our written Code of Conduct applies to all persons and businesses associated with our company, including directors, officers, employees and consultants. We have a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and all business associates with whom we work, including our accounting, financial reporting and asset management departments. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.quorumhealth.com.
 Corporate Integrity Agreement
 On August 4, 2014, CHS became subject to the terms of a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG arising from a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of their affiliated hospitals. The OIG has required us to be bound by the terms of the CHS CIA commencing on the Spin-off date and applying to us for the remainder of the five-year compliance term required of CHS, which terminates on August 4, 2019.
 The compliance measures and the reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIA include:
  
• | continuing the duties and activities of the Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate Compliance Work Group, and Facility Compliance Officers and committees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining a written Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to full compliance with all statutes, regulations, and guidelines applicable to federal healthcare programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining written policies and procedures addressing matters included in our Compliance Program, including adherence to medical necessity and admissions standards for inpatient hospital stays;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing general compliance training;
--+----------------------------------------

• | providing specific training for employees and affiliates handling our billing, case management and clinical documentation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing the Confidential Disclosure Program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing the screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare program; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of the corporate Compliance Program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A material, uncorrected violation of the CIA could lead to our exclusion or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties if we fail to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification by us or any individual or entity on behalf of us in connection with reports required under the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we are required to provide to the federal government regarding our healthcare practices and our compliance with federal regulations. We believe that we are currently operating our business in compliance with the CIA and are unaware of any historical actions on our part that could represent a violation under the terms of the CIA.
 Insurance Reserves
 Professional and General Liability Insurance and Workers’ Compensation Liability Insurance Reserves
 As part of the business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we maintain insurance exceeding a self-insured retention level for these types of claims. Our self-insurance reserves reflect the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based on actuarial calculations as of period end. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future due to updated facts and circumstances. Insurance expense in the statements of income includes the actuarially determined estimates for losses in the current year, including claims incurred but not reported, the changes in estimates for losses in prior years based on actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections, the insurance premiums for losses related to policies obtained to cover amounts in excess of our self-insured retention levels, the administrative costs of the insurance programs, and interest expense related to the discounted portions of these liabilities. Our reserves for professional and general liability and workers’ compensation liability claims are based on semi-annual actuarial calculations, which are discounted to present value and consider historical claims data, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The liabilities for self-insured claims are discounted based on our risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self-insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid.
 A portion of our reserves for workers’ compensation and professional and general liability claims included on our balance sheets relates to incurred but not reported claims prior to the Spin-off. These claims were fully indemnified by CHS under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result, we have a corresponding receivable from CHS related to these claims on our balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had total liabilities of $129.0 million and $126.1 million related to insurance for professional and general liabilities and workers’ compensation liability, respectively, of which $68.3 million and $83.4 million, respectively, were the indemnified portions for which we have offsetting receivables from CHS.
 Under our current insurance arrangements, our self-insured retention level for professional and general liability claims is $5 million per claim. Additionally, we maintain a $0.5 million per claim, high deductible program for workers’ compensation. We maintain a separate insurance arrangement for professional and general liability related to QHR, due to the differing nature of this business. The self-insured retention level for QHR is $6 million for professional and general liability insurance.
 Employee Health Benefits
 We are self-insured for substantially all of the medical benefits of our employees. We maintain a liability for our current estimate of incurred but not reported employee health claims based on historical claims data provided by third-party administrators. The undiscounted reserve for self-insured employee health benefits was $10.4 million and $8.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Expense each period is based on the actual claims received during the period plus any adjustment to the liability for incurred but not reported employee health claims.

Employees and Medical Staff
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 11,600 employees, including approximately 3,000 part-time employees. We are subject to various federal and state laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. We maintain a number of different employee benefit plans.
Physicians
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Our ability to generate revenues from our hospital operations business is impacted by the number, quality and specialty areas of practice of physicians providing healthcare services at our facilities, and additionally the scheduling and admitting of patients by these physicians. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 259 employed physicians at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities. Some physicians provide services in our healthcare facilities pursuant to a contract with us. These contracts generally describe the types of healthcare services that the physician is contracted to perform, establish the duties and obligations of the physician, require certain performance criteria be met by the physician and fix the compensation arrangements for the services performed by the physician. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the board of directors of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve the physician’s acceptance to the medical staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals that we do not own and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. It is essential to our hospital operations business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialty care service areas required to support our hospital operations business and that we maintain good relationships with our physicians. In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain desired specialty care service areas and are affected by the difficulty that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance.
Unions and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,200 employees, including approximately 800 part-time employees, at our seven hospitals represented by labor unions. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages that had a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.
