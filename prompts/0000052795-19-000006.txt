ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Company Overview
Anixter International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Anixter" or the "Company") and sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "we", "our", "us", or "ourselves", founded in 1957, is headquartered near Chicago, Illinois and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AXE. The Company was formerly known as Itel Corporation which was incorporated under Delaware law in 1967. Through Anixter Inc. and its subsidiaries, we are a leading distributor of network and security solutions, electrical and electronic solutions, and utility power solutions.
Through our global presence, technical expertise and supply chain solutions, we help our customers reduce the risk, cost and complexity of their supply chains. We add value to the distribution process by providing approximately 130,000 customers access to innovative inventory management programs, nearly 600,000 products and over $1.0 billion in inventory, 316 warehouses/branch locations with over 9 million square feet of space, and locations in over 300 cities across approximately 50 countries. We are a leader in providing advanced inventory management services including procurement, just-in-time delivery, material management programs, turn-key yard layout and management, quality assurance testing, component kit production, storm/event kitting, small component assembly and e-commerce and electronic data interchange to a broad spectrum of customers. 
Our customers are international, national, regional and local companies, covering a broad and diverse set of industry groups including manufacturing, resource extraction, telecommunications, internet service providers, finance, education, healthcare, retail, transportation, utilities (both public power and investor owned), defense and government; and include contractors, installers, system integrators, value-added resellers, architects, engineers and wholesale distributors. Our customer base is well-diversified with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of sales.
Our differentiated operating model is premised on our belief that our customers and suppliers value a partner with consistent global product offerings, technical expertise (including product and application knowledge and support) and customized supply chain solutions, all supported by common business practices that ensure the same "look, touch and feel" worldwide.
Our growth strategy is driven by constant refresh and expansion of our product and solution offerings to meet marketplace needs. This organic growth approach extends to a constantly evolving set of supply chain services that are designed to lower the customer’s total cost of procuring, owning and deploying the products we sell. We have identified security solutions, emerging markets, utilities, professional audio/visual, and wireless as growth opportunities we are pursuing. Organic growth will periodically be supplemented with acquisitions where the benefits associated with geographic expansion, market penetration or new product line additions are weighted in favor of "buying versus building."
Business Segments and Products
We have identified Network & Security Solutions ("NSS"), Electrical & Electronic Solutions ("EES") and Utility Power Solutions ("UPS") as reportable segments. The following is a brief description of each of our reportable segments and business activities.
Within our segments, we are also organized by geographies. Our geographies consist of North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Emerging Markets, which includes Asia Pacific and Central and Latin America ("CALA").
Network & Security Solutions ("NSS")
The Network & Security Solutions segment, with sales in approximately 55 countries, supplies products and customized Supply Chain Solutions to customers in a diverse range of industries including technology, finance, telecommunications service providers, transportation, education, government, healthcare and retail. NSS sells these products directly to end users or through various channels including data communications contractors, security, network, professional audio/visual and systems integrators, and directly to end users. NSS has a broad product portfolio that includes copper and fiber optic cable and connectivity, access control, video surveillance, intrusion and fire/life safety, cabinets, power, cable management, wireless, professional audio/video, voice and networking switches and other ancillary products.

Anixter's Infrastructure as a Platform and ipAssuredSM programs help customers make intelligent buying decisions around network and security infrastructure and improve efficiency to meet their sustainability goals.
Electrical & Electronic Solutions ("EES")
The Electrical & Electronic Solutions segment, with sales in approximately 40 countries, supplies a broad range of wire and cable, control, power/gear, lighting and core electrical products and customized supply chain solutions to the Commercial and Industrial ("C&I") and Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") markets. The C&I group supplies products for the transmission of power and signals in industrial applications to customers in key markets including oil, gas and petrochemical, alternative energy, utility, power generation and distribution, transportation, commercial, industrial, natural resource and water and wastewater treatment. It sells directly to end users or through channels including electrical contractors, security and automation integrators, and engineering, procurement and construction firms. The OEM group supplies products used in the manufacturing of automotive, industrial, medical, transportation, marine, military and communications equipment, selling to OEM and panel, cable and harness shops. The product portfolio in this global business includes electrical and electronic wire and cable, shipboard cable, support and supply products, low-voltage cable, instrumentation cable, industrial communication and control products, security cable, connectors, industrial Ethernet switches, and voice and data cable. Value-added services, including supply chain management services and technical support, are tailored to position us as a specialist in fast growing emerging markets, OEMs and industrial verticals.

Suppliers
We source products from thousands of suppliers, with approximately one-third of our annual dollar volume purchases sourced from our five largest suppliers. An important element of our overall business strategy is to develop and maintain close relationships with our key suppliers, which include the world’s leading manufacturers of communication cabling, connectivity, support and supply products, electrical wire and cable, and utility products. Such relationships emphasize joint product planning, inventory management, technical support, advertising and marketing. In support of this strategy, we generally do not compete with our suppliers in product design or manufacturing activities. We do sell a small amount of private label products that carry a brand name exclusive to us.

Our typical distribution agreement generally includes the following significant terms:


• | a non-exclusive right to resell products to any customer in a geographical area (typically defined as a country, with the exception of our UPS business which is typically defined as a county or state);


• | cancelable upon 60 to 90 days notice by either party for any reason;


• | no minimum purchase requirements, although pricing may change with volume on a prospective basis; and


• | the right to pass through the manufacturer’s warranty to our customers.

Distribution and Service Platform 
We cost-effectively serve our customers’ needs through our computer systems, which connect the majority of our warehouses and sales offices throughout the world. The systems are designed for sales support, order entry, inventory status, order tracking, credit review and material management. Customers may also conduct business through our e-commerce platform.
We operate a series of large, modern, regional distribution centers in key geographic locations in North America, EMEA and Emerging Markets that provide for cost-effective, reliable storage and delivery of products to our customers. We have designated 21 warehouses as regional distribution centers. Collectively, these facilities store approximately 30% of our inventory. In certain cities, some smaller warehouses are also maintained to maximize transportation efficiency and to provide for the local needs of customers. Our network of regional distribution centers, local distribution centers, service centers, branch locations and sales offices consists of 250 locations in the United States, 31 in Canada, 26 in the United Kingdom, 23 in Continental Europe and the Middle East, 32 in Latin America, 12 in Asia and 15 in Australia and New Zealand. 
We have developed close relationships with certain freight, package delivery and courier services to minimize transit times between our facilities and customer locations, as well as a dedicated delivery fleet of over 500 vehicles in our UPS segment. The combination of our information systems, distribution network and delivery partnerships allows us to provide a high level of customer service while maintaining a reasonable level of investment in inventory and facilities.
Employees
At December 28, 2018, we employed over 9,300 people. Approximately 50% of the employees are engaged in sales or sales-related activities, approximately 35% are engaged in warehousing and distribution operations, and approximately 15% are engaged in support activities, including inventory management, information services, finance, human resources and general management. We do not have any significant concentrations of employees subject to collective bargaining agreements within any of our segments.
Competition
Given our role as an aggregator of many different types of products from many different sources and because these products are sold to many different industry groups, there is no well-defined industry group against which we compete. We view the competitive environment as highly fragmented with hundreds of distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly or through multiple distribution channels to end users or other resellers. There is significant competition within each end market and geography served that creates pricing pressure and the need for excellent service. Competition is based primarily on breadth of products, quality, services, relationships, price and geographic proximity. We believe that we have a significant competitive advantage due to our comprehensive product and service offerings, global distribution network, technically-trained sales team and customized supply chain solutions. We believe our global distribution platform provides a competitive advantage to serving multinational customers’ needs. Our operations and logistics platform gives us the ability to ship orders from inventory for delivery within 24 to 48 hours to all major global markets. 
We enhance our value proposition to both key suppliers and customers through our technical expertise, global standards participation testing and demonstration facilities and numerous quality assurance certification programs such as ISO 9001:2015 and ISO/TS 16949:2009. Our NSS, EES and UPS segments leverage our certified Infrastructure Solutions Lab located at our suburban Chicago headquarters to support customers with technology needs related to enterprise networks, data centers, physical security, building technologies and industrial communications and control. At this lab, we evaluate performance and interoperability to help customers reduce risk through informed purchasing decisions. Our Solutions Briefing Centers, premier technology education and demonstration facilities located in various regions around the globe, focus on providing our customers with the necessary information to make informed decisions around complex, end-to-end technology solutions.

Contract Sales and Backlog
We have a number of customers who purchase products under long-term contractual arrangements. In such circumstances, the relationship with the customer typically involves a high degree of material requirements planning and information systems interfaces and, in some cases, may require the maintenance of a dedicated distribution facility or dedicated personnel and inventory at, or in close proximity to, the customer site to meet the needs of the customer. Such contracts do not generally require the customer to purchase any minimum amount of goods from us, but would require that materials acquired by us, as a result of joint material requirements planning between us and the customer, be purchased by the customer. Backlog orders represent approximately five to six weeks of sales and the majority of these orders ship to customers within 30 to 60 days from order date. 
Seasonality
The operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal fluctuations except for the impact resulting from variations in the number of billing days from quarter to quarter. Our EES and UPS segments experience some seasonality as weather can restrict project work. Consecutive quarter sales from the third to fourth quarters are generally lower due to the holidays and lower number of billing days as compared to other consecutive quarter comparisons. There were 253 billing days in both 2018 and 2017 and 254 billing days in 2016.
