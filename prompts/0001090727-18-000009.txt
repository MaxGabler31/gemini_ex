Item 1. | Business

Overview
United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”) was founded in 1907 as a private messenger and delivery service in Seattle, Washington. Today, we are the world’s largest package delivery company, a leader in the U.S. less-than-truckload industry and a premier provider of global supply chain management solutions. We deliver packages each business day for 1.5 million shipping customers to 9.0 million receivers ("consignees") in over 220 countries and territories. In 2017, we delivered an average of 20.0 million pieces per day, or a total of 5.1 billion packages. Total revenue in 2017 was $65.872 billion.
We serve the global market for logistics services, which includes transportation, distribution, contract logistics, ground freight, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage, insurance and financing. We have three segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Supply Chain & Freight, all of which are described below. For financial information concerning our segments and geographic regions, refer to note 12 of our audited consolidated financial statements.
Strategy
Our market strategy is to provide customers with advanced logistics solutions made possible by a broad portfolio of differentiated services and capabilities expertly assembled and integrated into our customers’ businesses. This approach, supported by our efficient and globally balanced multimodal network, enables us to deliver value to our customers and thereby build lasting partnerships with them.
Customers leverage our broad portfolio of logistics capabilities comprised of: our balanced global presence in North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America; reliability; industry-leading technologies and solutions expertise for competitive advantage in markets where they choose to compete. We continue to invest to expand our integrated global network and service portfolio. In 2017, we formed and received approval for a joint venture with SF Express, China’s leading small package company, which will ultimately provide millions of potential customers in China with improved access to buyers and sellers around the world. We acquired Freightex, Ltd. ("Freightex") to extend our platform-based freight transportation capabilities into both the U.K. and European markets. The acquisition of Eirpost Group Unlimited Company ("Nightline") vaulted UPS to a leading market position in Ireland. We added shipping centers and healthcare and distribution facilities in Mexico, Colombia and India. In 2017, we also acquired STTAS Global Holdings, Inc. ("Sandler & Travis Trade Advisory Services" or "STTAS"), the world’s largest dedicated global trade compliance management company.

We are increasing our capital expenditures to meet increasing global demand. Within our facilities, we are expanding automated capacity, driving greater efficiencies and providing additional network flexibilities. We also continue to invest in our air network capacity through aircraft acquisitions. In 2017, we announced investments in four new regional facilities in the Indianapolis, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Dallas areas, with the previously announced regional facility in Atlanta, Georgia continuing to move toward completion.
We have a long history of sound financial management and our consolidated balance sheet reflects financial strength. Cash generation is a significant strength of UPS, giving us ample capacity to service our obligations and allowing for distributions to shareowners, reinvestment in our business and the pursuit of growth opportunities.
Reporting segments and products & services
Global Small Package
Our global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. We serve more than 220 countries and territories around the world along with domestic delivery service in over 50 countries. We handle packages that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth as well as palletized shipments weighing more than 150 pounds. All of our package services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies.
We handle all levels of service (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through one global integrated pickup and delivery network. We combine all packages within our network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables one UPS driver to pick up customers’ shipments for any of our services at the same scheduled time each day. Compared to companies with single service network designs, our integrated network uniquely provides operational and capital efficiencies while being more environmentally friendly.
We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages upon request. Customers can schedule pickups for one to five days a week, based on their specific needs. Additionally, our wholly-owned and partnered global network offers more than 150,000 entry points where customers can tender a package to us at a location or time convenient to them. This combined network includes UPS drivers who can accept packages provided to them, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Some of these locations offer a full array of services, including pickup, delivery and packing options, while others are drop-off locations only.
The continued growth of online and mobile shopping has increased our customers’ needs for efficient and reliable returns, resulting in our development of a robust selection of returns services that are available in more than 145 countries. The portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label options and a vast network of consumer drop points, as well as a selection of return technologies that promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. These options vary based on customer need and country and include solutions such as UPS Returns®, as well as more-specialized services such as UPS Returns® Exchange. Our technologies promote systems integration, client ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise, which help reduce costs and improve efficiency of our merchants' reverse logistics processes. The newly launched UPS Returns® Manager is an excellent example of this value. 
We operate one of the largest airlines in the world, with global operations centered at our Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky. Worldport sort capacity has expanded over the years due to volume growth and centralization efforts. Our European air hub is located in Cologne, Germany, and we maintain Asia Pacific air hubs in Shanghai, China; Shenzhen, China and Hong Kong. Our regional air hub in Canada is located in Hamilton, Ontario and our regional air hub for Latin America and the Caribbean is in Miami, Florida.
Our U.S. regional air hubs in Dallas, Texas; Ontario, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Rockford, Illinois support Worldport. This network design creates cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous U.S.

U.S. Domestic Package reporting segment
We are a leader in time-definite, money-back guaranteed, small package delivery services in the U.S. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed ground and air package transportation services. 

• | Customers can select from same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives. UPS’s Air portfolio offers options enabling customers to specify a time-of-day guarantee for their delivery (e.g., by 8:00 A.M., 10:30 A.M., noon, end of day, etc.).


• | Customers can also leverage our extensive ground network to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service that serves every U.S. business and residential address. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of 14.1 million, most within one to three business days.


• | We also offer UPS SurePost, an economy residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. UPS SurePost is a contractual residential ground service that combines the consistency and reliability of the UPS Ground network with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service. We utilize our operational technology to identify multiple package delivery opportunities and redirect UPS SurePost packages for final delivery, improving time in transit, customer service and operational efficiency.

International Package reporting segment
Our International Package reporting segment includes small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America, and the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa ("ISMEA"). We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day and time-definite international shipping services. We offer more guaranteed time-definite express options (Express Plus, Express and Express Saver) than any other carrier.

• | In 2017, we continued expansion of our Express time-definite portfolios:


◦ | We expanded UPS WorldWide Express to five new countries around the globe.


◦ | UPS Express now reaches 124 countries with guaranteed mid-day delivery and 56 countries with guaranteed morning delivery with Express Plus.


◦ | Express Saver reaches 220 countries and territories with guaranteed end-of-day delivery.


◦ | Express Freight Midday is available from all 67 WorldWide Express Freight origin countries to 35 destination countries.


• | For international package shipments that do not require Express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. The service is available from more than 80 origin countries to more than 220 countries and territories.


• | For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada and between the U.S. and Mexico.

Europe, our largest region outside of the U.S., accounts for approximately half of international revenue and is one of the primary drivers of our growth. To accommodate the strong potential for growth in small package exports, we made a series of enhancements to both our ground and air networks that help reduce transit time by one to two days and will result in improved exporting opportunities for customers in Europe. These expansions and enhancements are part of our commitment to invest nearly $2 billion in our European infrastructure.
Asia Pacific remains a strategic market due to growth rates in intra-Asia trade and the expanding Chinese economy. To capitalize on these opportunities, we are bringing faster time-in-transit to customers focused on intra-Asia trade and reducing transit time from Asia to the U.S. and Europe. Through added flight frequencies, we provide our customers the ability to ship next day to more places in the U.S. and Europe - guaranteed - than any other express carrier. We serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement company-owned operations. Our new joint venture with SF Express combines SF’s extensive Chinese network with UPS’s delivery capabilities in the U.S. and Europe to increase our market presence and help provide Chinese enterprises with greater global access. 
Additional international highlights include several air network enhancements, improving time in transit and better addressing growing markets. A new direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai improves time in transit to key destinations in the ISMEA region for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and the Americas. Europe added flight segments in Lithuania, Poland and Spain, while a dedicated chartered flight from Cologne to Casablanca continues our investment strategy in Morocco, an emerging market.

Supply Chain & Freight segment
The Supply Chain & Freight segment consists of our forwarding and logistics services, truckload freight brokerage, dedicated contract carriage truckload services, less-than-truckload (“LTL”) services and our financial offerings through UPS Capital. Supply chain complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation, distribution and international trade and brokerage services, with complementary financial and information services. Outsourcing of non-core logistics activity is a strategy more and more companies are pursuing. With increased competition and growth opportunities in new markets, businesses require flexible and responsive supply chains to support their business strategies. We meet this demand by offering a broad array of supply chain services in more than 200 countries and territories.
Freight Forwarding
We are one of the largest U.S. domestic air freight carriers and among the top international air freight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global air freight services. Additionally, as one of the world’s leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full-container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world.
Truckload Freight Brokerage 
In 2015, we acquired Coyote Logistics Midco, Inc. ("Coyote"), a U.S.-based truckload freight brokerage company. We successfully integrated this large-scale truckload freight brokerage and transportation management services operation into our Supply Chain & Freight segment and have seen significant synergies in the areas of purchased transportation, backhaul utilization, technology systems and industry best practices. Coyote's access to our UPS fleet, combined with its broad carrier network, has created a customized capacity solution for all markets, customers and situations. Moreover, Coyote creates access to UPS services (such as air freight, customs brokerage and global freight forwarding) for its customer base.
In January 2017, UPS acquired U.K.-based freight brokerage firm, Freightex. The acquisition of Freightex adds a full-scale truckload brokerage and transportation management solution to UPS’s European portfolio, creating a one-stop shop for shippers throughout Europe with freight ranging from parcel to full truckload. The combination of Coyote’s technology and business model with Freightex’s market knowledge and established customer and carrier base complements UPS’s North American truckload brokerage business, as many international shippers know and trust the Coyote truckload product.
Global Logistics and Distribution
We provide value-added logistics services to customers through our global network of company-owned and leased distribution centers and field stocking locations. We leverage a global network of more than 900 facilities in more than 100 countries around the globe to ensure products and parts are in the right place, at the right time.
Our distribution centers are strategically located near UPS air and ground transportation hubs for rapid delivery to consumer and business markets. In 2017, UPS began piloting a new integrated transportation-fulfillment solution for small business e-commerce merchants, enabling them to rapidly expand and grow their offerings without additional capital investment. 
UPS Post Sales relies on central and field stocking sites to support installed and delivered equipment and devices. In 2017, we integrated UPS Access Point locations into our network, offering greater flexibility, more convenience and improved service for our customers. We also began piloting GPS tracking capabilities and are converting our primary transportation couriers across the U.S. and Canada, which will continue in 2018.
Since its acquisition in late 2016, Maze 1 Limited ("Marken") has served as the clinical trials logistics subsidiary of UPS. Marken strengthened its position as the only patient-centric supply chain organization 100 percent dedicated to the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. Marken expanded into new facilities, acquiring Touchdown International Logistics Co., Ltd. in Taiwan, and launching a new hybrid service that leverages the strength and reach of UPS’s global network. The focus in 2017 was on accelerating revenue growth through new business wins and realizing cost synergies in areas such as IT purchasing, air transportation and insurance premiums.
UPS Express Critical provides urgent, secure transportation for time-sensitive and high-value goods. The service complements UPS's core parcel and air freight services. It includes same-day, next-flight-out and door-to-door ground services, including specialized charter and hand-carry services for both lightweight and heavyweight shipments. In 2017, UPS focused on serving fast-growing industries such as life sciences and aerospace and we will continue this focus in 2018.

UPS Freight
UPS Freight offers regional, inter-regional and long-haul LTL services in all 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Mexico. UPS Freight provides reliable LTL service backed by a day-definite, on-time guarantee at no additional cost. UPS Freight also provides dedicated contract carriage truckload services to select clients. Additionally, user friendly shipping, visibility and billing technology offerings, including UPS WorldShip®, Quantum View and UPS Billing Center, allow freight customers to create electronic bills of lading, monitor shipment progress and reconcile shipping charges.
Customs Brokerage
We are among the world’s largest customs brokers by both the number of shipments processed annually and by the number of dedicated brokerage employees worldwide. In addition to customs clearance services, we also provide trade management and consulting services. In 2017, we acquired STTAS, the world’s largest dedicated global trade compliance management company. STTAS will help us reach our vision of becoming the global broker of choice by expanding the depth of services we provide, as well as our geographic coverage.
UPS Capital
UPS Capital provides financial, insurance and payment services to leverage cash and help protect companies from risk in their supply chains. With services available in more than 21 countries, UPS Capital and its affiliates support all aspects of the order-to-cash cycle, including financing inventory warehoused overseas, insuring shipments and providing payment solutions. The UPS Capital suite of insurance services, trade finance and payment solutions helps customers protect their assets and keeps their businesses running smoothly. With the acquisitions of Parcel Pro™ and the Insured Parcel Services business of G4S International Logistics in 2015, UPS Capital now offers insured transportation of high value goods including loose stones, finished jewelry and wristwatches.
Our People
The strength of our company is our people, working together with a common purpose. We had more than 454,000 employees (excluding temporary seasonal employees) as of December 31, 2017, of which 374,000 are in the U.S. and 80,000 are located internationally. Our global workforce includes approximately 81,000 management employees (40% of whom are part-time) and 373,000 hourly employees (49% of whom are part-time). 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 280,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). During 2014, the Teamsters ratified a national master agreement with UPS that will expire on July 31, 2018. 
We have approximately 2,700 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association ("IPA"), which runs through September 1, 2021. The economic provisions in the agreement included pay increases, signing bonuses and enhanced pension benefits.
Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable November 1, 2013. We are currently in negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727. In addition, approximately 3,100 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”) that will expire on July 31, 2019.
Competition
UPS is a global leader in logistics. We offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and compete with many different local, regional, national and international logistics providers. Our competitors include worldwide postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others, including startups that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. Through our supply chain service offerings, we compete with a number of providers in the supply chain, financial services and information technology industries.

Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths include:
Global Network.   We believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery service network. We also have extensive air freight, ocean freight, ground freight and logistics networks that provide additional capabilities in the global transportation and logistics market. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis. 
Global Presence.   We serve more than 220 countries and territories around the world. We have a significant presence in all of the world’s major economies.
Cutting-Edge Technology.    We are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency.
Technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform. Customer need drives our technology offerings. We offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own businesses not only to send, manage and track their shipments conveniently, but also to provide their customers with better information services. We provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated UPS tools directly into their own websites.
Broad Portfolio of Services.    Our portfolio of services helps customers choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements. Increasingly, our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many UPS services beyond package delivery. For example, our supply chain services – such as freight forwarding, truckload brokerage, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management – help improve the efficiency of the supply chain management process.
Customer Relationships.    We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. We serve 1.5 million shipping customers and 9.0 million delivery customers daily. Cross selling small package, supply chain and freight services across our customer base is an important growth mechanism for UPS.
Brand Equity.    We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality service, reliability and service innovation. The distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.
Distinctive Culture.    We believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our distinctive “employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership tradition dates back to 1927, when our founders, who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, first offered stock to employees. To encourage employee stock ownership, we maintain several stock-based compensation programs.
Financial Strength.    Our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale; to invest in employee development, technology, transportation equipment and facilities; to pursue strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth; to service our obligations and to return value to our shareowners in the form of dividends, share repurchases and steady share growth.
Government regulation
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in connection with our package and non-package businesses in the countries in which we operate. Certain of these laws and regulations are summarized below.
Air Operations
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), have regulatory authority over United Parcel Service Co.’s (“UPS Airlines”) air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.
6

The DOT’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as insurance requirements, discriminatory pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the authority of the President of the United States, international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation regulations imposed by foreign governments in the countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. UPS Airlines has international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.
The FAA’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In 1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable FAA regulations. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.
UPS aircraft maintenance programs and procedures, including aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals, are approved for all aircraft under FAA regulations. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition, age and the enactment of additional FAA regulatory requirements.
The TSA regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the TSA mission statement to “protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.” UPS Airlines, and specified airport and off-airport locations, are regulated under TSA regulations applicable to the transportation of cargo in an air network. In addition, personnel, facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with TSA regulations.
UPS Airlines, along with a number of other domestic airlines, participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Our participation in the CRAF program allows the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) to requisition specified UPS Airlines wide-body aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency. The DOD compensates us for the use of aircraft under the CRAF program. In addition, participation in CRAF entitles UPS Airlines to bid for military cargo charter operations.
Ground Operations
Our ground transportation of packages in the U.S. is subject to regulation by the DOT and its agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”) and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service for drivers. We are subject to similar regulation in many non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the U.S. Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government, and created the Postal Rate Commission, an independent agency, to recommend postal rates. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 amended the 1970 Act to give the re-named Postal Regulatory Commission revised oversight authority over many aspects of the Postal Service, including postal rates, product offerings and service standards. We sometimes participate in the proceedings before the Postal Regulatory Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services.
Our ground operations are subject to compliance with various cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including regulation by the TSA.
Customs
We are subject to the customs laws in the countries in which we operate, regarding the import and export of shipments, including those related to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, the TSA, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission and the DOT. 
7

Environmental
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our business units. These laws and regulations cover a variety of processes, including, but not limited to: proper storage, handling and disposal of waste materials; appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks; complying with laws regarding clean air, including those governing emissions; protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders. We have established site- and activity-specific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant. In addition, we have created numerous programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations.
Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Our aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. Our international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain countries in which we operate. 
Communications
Because of our extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in our aircraft and ground transportation operations, we are subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses our activities pertaining to satellite communications.
