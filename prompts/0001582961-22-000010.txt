ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
Our mission is to simplify cloud computing so that developers and businesses can spend more time building software that changes the world. 
DigitalOcean is a leading cloud computing platform offering on-demand infrastructure and platform tools for developers, start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs. We were founded with the guiding principle that the transformative benefits of the cloud should be easy to leverage, broadly accessible, reliable and affordable. Our platform simplifies cloud computing, enabling our customers to rapidly accelerate innovation and increase their productivity and agility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 609,000 individual and business customers using our platform to build, deploy and scale software applications. Our users include software engineers, researchers, data scientists, system administrators, students and hobbyists. Our customers use our platform across numerous industry verticals and for a wide range of use cases, such as web and mobile applications, website hosting, e-commerce, media and gaming, personal web projects, and managed services, among many others. We believe that our focus on simplicity, community, open source and customer support are the four key differentiators of our business, driving a broad range of customers around the world to build their applications on our platform. 
Cloud computing is revolutionizing how companies across the globe develop and deploy applications. The cloud offers lower upfront cost and superior flexibility, extensibility and scalability as compared to on-premise software development environments. These benefits are especially valuable for start-ups and SMBs, as they typically have more limited financial resources, operational expertise and IT personnel. As software and cloud-based technologies have become essential across industries and businesses of all sizes, the number of software developers and their strategic importance to organizations are both increasing significantly. According to IDC, the number of developers globally was 26.2 million in 2020 and is expected to grow to 43.2 million by 2025. 
Improving the developer experience and increasing developer productivity are core to our mission. Our developer cloud platform was designed with simplicity in mind to ensure that software developers can spend less time managing their infrastructure and more time turning their ideas into innovative applications to grow their businesses. Simplicity guides how we design and enhance our easy-to-use-interface, the core capabilities we offer our customers and our approach to predictable and transparent pricing for our solutions. We offer mission-critical infrastructure solutions across compute, storage and networking, and we also enable developers to extend the native capabilities of our cloud with fully managed application, container and database offerings. In just minutes, developers can set up thousands of virtual machines, secure their projects, enable performance monitoring and scale up and down as needed. Our pricing is consumption-based and billed monthly in arrears, making it easy for our customers to track usage on an ongoing basis and optimize their deployments. 
The global developer and open source communities are fundamental to our business, and a key source of ideas and innovations that support our sustained growth. Our developer-centric approach has helped us foster a large and loyal following. We attract approximately 6 million monthly unique visitors to our websites, host what we believe is the largest hackathon in the world, and offer a comprehensive library of high-quality technical tutorials and community-generated questions and answers. Developers and SMBs especially value open source technology as it allows them greater choice, affordability and flexibility, and our platform is designed to take advantage of open source technology to provide our customers with a much more efficient way to work. Our participation in and support of the open source community further enhance the attractiveness, depth and scalability of our offering. 
Our customers depend on us for their critical business needs, and we are passionate about providing superior 24x7 customer support to all of our customers, regardless of size. We believe our customer support, coupled with our easy-to-use self-help resources and active developer community, has created tremendous brand loyalty amongst our growing customer base. Our customers become great advocates for DigitalOcean and are a common source of new customer referrals. 
We have a highly efficient self-service customer acquisition model, which we complement with a targeted sales force focused on inside sales, outside sales and partnership opportunities to drive revenue growth. Our sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 12%, 11% and 12% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The efficiency of our go-to-market model and our focus on the needs of the individual and SMB markets have helped us build a global customer base that continues to grow. We had approximately 609,000 customers as of December 31, 2021, up from approximately 573,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 543,000 as of December 31, 2019. We have a growing number of 
customers with higher spending levels, and these larger customers are expanding their business with us at a faster rate than our overall customer base. We had approximately 99,000 customers paying more than $50 per month as of December 31, 2021, up from approximately 80,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 68,000 as of December 31, 2019. Our customers are spread across over 185 countries, and around two-thirds of our revenue has historically come from customers located outside the United States. Revenue from customers paying more than $50 per month as a percentage of total revenue grew from 74% in 2019 to 78% in 2020 to 82% in 2021. Our average revenue per customer (which we refer to as ARPU) has increased significantly, from $40.16 in 2019 to $47.78 in 2020 to $59.96 in 2021. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics” for additional information. 
Our Solution 
DigitalOcean was founded with the guiding principle that the transformative benefits of the cloud should be easy to leverage, broadly accessible, reliable and affordable. We pioneered the developer cloud platform to simplify cloud computing, enabling developers and developer teams to quickly deploy and scale applications, collaborate efficiently and improve business performance. Empowered by an easy-to-use self-service model, intuitive control panel and highly predictable pricing, our customers are able to rapidly accelerate innovation and increase their productivity and agility. 
•Simple and Intuitive. Our platform is engineered to take a user from inquiry to deployment within minutes, without any specialized training or heavy implementation. We abstract away the complexity that is generally found across legacy cloud providers to provide a compelling, intuitive interface with click-and-go options. Our platform provides users with a deployment interface that is comparable to interfaces provided by consumer internet leaders and is designed to minimize the number of steps to deployment. 
•Designed by Developers for Developers. Our platform was built with a developer-first mentality and is designed for a wide range of use cases, such as web and mobile applications, website hosting, e-commerce, media and gaming, personal web projects, and managed services, among many others. Our innovative cloud platform is designed to eliminate the complexity and obstacles associated with deploying in and managing the cloud. Simplicity starts with our Droplets, which have revolutionized the way developers and teams deploy in the cloud. Droplets are our virtual machines that can be spun up in less than a minute, enabling developers to spend less time managing infrastructure and more time innovating. 
•Built to Help Businesses Scale. Our highly-curated set of solutions, including compute, storage and networking offerings, managed databases and developer and management tools, are all designed to address the needs of start-ups and SMBs as they scale their businesses and require more cloud capabilities. Our managed services, including our Managed Database, Managed Kubernetes and App Platform services, are specifically focused on enabling our SMB customers—regardless of business type or geography—to scale their operations on our platform. 
•Open Source. Our participation in and support of the open source software community enhances the attractiveness, depth and scalability of our offering. It increases the transparency of our technology and allows our customers to more efficiently write their own integrations. We give back to the community by sponsoring projects to create content and tools that help developers build great software and hosting events that are focused on driving the growth of open source, such as our Hacktoberfest, which we believe is the largest hackathon in the world. 
•Differentiated Customer Support. We offer expert 24x7 technical support and customer service, with support staff spanning various time zones to ensure our customers quickly achieve their objectives and overcome challenges. Developers and engineers are a key part of our customer support team, and our technical support is—and always has been—available free of charge to all customers. Customers cite our attentive support as a key driver of their decision to start and grow their businesses on our platform. 
•Broad-Based Community Ecosystem. We have built one of the world’s largest developer learning communities, with more than 6,000 high-quality developer tutorials and approximately 30,000 community-generated questions & answers. The strength and continued growth of our community ecosystem, which is managed by our internal developer relations and editorial teams, is predicated on differentiated content on our community education website, which attracts approximately 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. As our community grows and generates more valuable content for our platform, we are able to attract more users, which ultimately increases our customer base and reinforces our highly efficient self-service model. 
•Transparent and Predictable Pricing. Our approach to billing and pricing is simple, intuitive and transparent. Our pricing is consumption-based and renewable monthly, making it easy for our customers to optimize their 
deployments. We provide detailed monthly invoices, irrespective of the customer’s size or number of products purchased, making it easy to track usage on an ongoing basis. We enable our customers to completely control their spending and ensure there are no hidden charges that appear at the end of the month. Like everything we do, we approach billing with a customer-first focus, enabling our customers to spend more time developing and deploying innovative applications rather than interpreting and navigating convoluted invoices. 
•Security and Data Protection. Maintaining the security and integrity of our platform is a critical focus for us, as well as for our customers who rely on us for their critical business needs. We invest significantly in securing the computing infrastructure foundation upon which our customers build and scale their projects. We remove the complexity of securing infrastructure for our customers and make it simple for them to build the security layers required for their use cases. We are also committed to customer data privacy and utilize best-in-class access, encryption and data protection technologies and processes. 
•Built for Collaboration. Our platform enables secure and efficient collaboration across developer teams to manage and scale infrastructure and applications. We support thousands of developer teams on our platform and provide them with easy-to-use tools to better manage their workflows.

Our Market Opportunity 
The Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) markets are two of the largest and fastest growing markets across all industries. According to IDC, the worldwide IaaS and PaaS markets for individuals and companies with less than 500 employees are estimated to be approximately $72.0 billion in the aggregate in 2022. The 2022 IaaS market, which is comprised of compute, storage and networking, is estimated to be $47.0 billion. The 2022 PaaS market, which includes database management systems, application platforms and other platform services, is estimated to be $25.0 billion. According to IDC, these combined IaaS and PaaS markets are expected to grow to $144.6 billion in 2025, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. 
We believe the individual developer, start-up and SMB markets are underserved, and we expect our massive addressable market to continue to grow rapidly. The key drivers of this growth come from the increasing technological innovation which drives cloud adoption combined with the growing number of developers and SMBs worldwide. According to IDC, the global developer population is expected to grow from 26.2 million in 2020 to 43.2 million by 2025. 
Our Growth Strategies 
We are driving significant growth by executing on the following key strategies: 
•Growing Our Customer Base. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to further expand our customer base. We have historically attracted customers by offering a low-friction, self-service cloud platform combined with a highly-efficient self-service marketing model. We are investing in strategies that we believe will continue to drive new customer adoption, especially among SMB customers, including new marketing initiatives that further optimize our self-service revenue funnel and targeted expansion of our sales teams, including in select international locations. 
•Increasing Usage by Our Existing Customers. Our customer base of approximately 609,000 customers represents a significant opportunity for further sales expansion through increased usage of our platform and adoption of additional product offerings. Our ARPU, which in part reflects increased usage by our existing customers, has increased significantly in recent years, from $40.16 in 2019 to $47.78 in 2020 to $59.96 in 2021. We expect to continue to increase our ARPU through the introduction of new products tailored to our customer base and an expanded go-to-market initiative focused on larger customers and specific use cases, both of which will drive enhanced usage of our platform and product offerings by our existing customers. 
•Investing in Our Platform and Product Offerings. We have a history of, and will continue to invest significantly in, delivering innovative products, features and functionality targeted at our core customer base. We believe the market opportunity for serving developers, start-ups and SMBs is very large and goes far beyond providing the core IaaS services of compute, storage and networking. We have successfully attracted new customers to our platform and driven expansion with existing customers through new product launches, such as our Managed Kubernetes offering in 2018, our Managed Database offering in 2019, our App Platform service in 2020 and our Premium Droplet offering in 2021. 
•Augmenting Our Platform through Opportunistic Strategic Acquisitions. We believe that strategic partnerships and acquisitions will allow us to accelerate our key platform, product and marketing initiatives. For example, we acquired Nimbella in the third quarter of 2021, which added a serverless compute offering to our suite of products, and we believe that additional acquisition opportunities will supplement our organic growth strategy. Likewise, we believe that strategic opportunities provide an attractive avenue to expand our product portfolio and customer base. In 2021, we launched DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB, a new, fully-managed database as a service offering in partnership with MongoDB. We intend to actively pursue both strategic partnerships and acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our business, accelerate customer acquisition, increase usage of our platform and/or expand our product offerings in our core markets. 
•Growing and Engaging Our Community. Approximately 6 million unique visitors interact with our websites, including our developer community, each month to learn, share and educate others. We are committed to supporting and expanding this community of innovators and technologists through high-quality content and expanded developer-focused programs and events around the world. We had approximately 140,000 participants in our Hacktoberfest event in 2021. In April 2020, we established our Hollie’s Hub For Good initiative, to provide infrastructure credits to non-profit companies that need resources to pursue charitable and philanthropic ambitions. Supporting and educating the developer community is one of our core values, but it also drives brand loyalty, expands our customer base and drives increased adoption of our products. 
Our Platform and Product Offerings 
We have designed our global cloud platform to ensure a simple, reliable and affordable cloud computing experience for our customer base of individual developers, start-ups and SMBs. This entails maintaining a high-performance global infrastructure, offering a highly curated set of solutions and providing a superior customer experience. The combination of these three elements enables our customers to focus their time and attention on building and running their applications or businesses rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. 
Our Global Infrastructure & Technology Network 
Our global infrastructure and technology network, built on the foundation of open source scalable cloud-native technologies, allows us to deliver an exceptional developer experience and suite of infrastructure and software solutions to our approximately 609,000 customers spread across the globe. Our infrastructure is offered to our customers across 14 data centers worldwide that are connected by a high-speed private backbone, enabling our customers to deploy their solutions across eight different geographic regions. We lease data centers in the New York City and San Francisco metropolitan areas, as well as in India, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and Singapore. These site locations were selected for their close proximity to key customer markets and allow access to global internet exchange points to provide consistent low-latency connectivity to large end-user networks. This allows our customers to choose where best to deploy the solution to optimize performance and minimize latency for their users. We lease data center space from leading providers to provide us the flexibility to quickly enter new markets and align our global footprint with our go-to-market strategy. 
We work closely with hardware manufacturers when designing our server platforms to continue to reduce acquisitions costs while at the same time optimizing reliability and performance for our customers. Our hardware engineering team works closely with CPU manufacturers to align our long-term server strategy to future technology advancements. We staff our data center operations team to ensure that we can provide the physical security, reliability and 
availability necessary for our customers—and that team additionally manages the physical server capacity to ensure that we are able to meet our customers’ demands. Our network engineering team manages the global backbone to ensure that we are making the best connectivity peering agreements to get customer traffic to the destination via the best available path. Our operations team actively monitors the cloud environment, responding to network incidents to ensure that customer impact is minimized and service availability is managed. 
We focus heavily on securing our network, products and customer data from potential security threats with a dedicated team of security professionals. We continually monitor our infrastructure network for vulnerabilities and risk through our security observability platform. The backend components of our network have been built with a view towards security using layers of multi-factor authentication, authorization and role-based access and are monitored for abnormal behaviors or intrusions. Security architecture and design is embedded in our product development lifecycle, and we continually test our products and infrastructure for security flaws. In addition, we apply rigorous privacy standards to all the customer data we protect in accordance with applicable privacy laws and best practices. We have put measures in place to collect personal data only to the extent necessary to service our customers and we protect customer content data through limited access.
In combination, our infrastructure and network provide our customers with a reliable, highly-performant and cost-effective platform to confidently build, deploy and scale their optimal solution, from single node based applications to globally distributed systems. 
Our Product Portfolio 
We provide a variety of cloud products and services that are specifically designed to address the needs of individual developers, start-ups and SMBs. We listen carefully to our customers’ feedback so we understand what they want and need to simplify cloud computing for them. Our goal is to address the core needs of this underserved customer base instead of offering thousands of complex products and services that are more suited to large enterprise companies or companies looking to move from an on-premise environment to the cloud. This focus has allowed us to expand our ARPU, especially among our larger customers, while maintaining very attractive customer retention metrics. 
Our initial product, launched in 2012, was the Droplet, a virtual machine that provides flexibility to build, test, secure and grow customers’ applications from start-up to scale. Since then, we have successfully launched many new products, which honor our commitment to always provide a simple, reliable and affordable experience for our core customer base. We have expanded our product portfolio with product innovations such as Dedicated Droplets, Premium Droplets, Spaces, Managed Kubernetes, Managed Databases and App Platform, which have proven our ability to successfully launch many new products to market and serve our customers’ needs. We have developed a product roadmap that will expand our managed and software offerings and enhance our ability to offer secure, scalable and reliable solutions for customers to grow their applications or businesses. 
Compute Offerings. Our compute offerings provide “simplicity with choice” so that developers can build and release scalable applications faster in the cloud. We provide flexible server configurations sized for any application, attractive price-to-performance and highly predictable pricing that is the same across regions and usage volumes. Our current compute offerings include: 
•Droplets (Virtual Machines): Developers can spin up the virtual machine of their choice in under a minute. We offer basic Droplets and Dedicated Droplets, such as general purpose, CPU-optimized, memory-optimized or storage-optimized configurations, which provide flexibility to build, test, secure and grow any application from start-up to scale. In 2021, we began offering Premium Droplets, which provide enhanced speed and memory performance, while maintaining our commitment to simplicity.
While developers love simplicity, they also value choice. With our product portfolio, we strive to give our customers the optionality they desire. Droplets provide developers with full control over their infrastructure, and with our new compute offerings, we manage the infrastructure for them, such as Managed Kubernetes and App Platform.
•Managed Kubernetes and Container Registry: In late 2018, we launched our easy-to-use Managed Kubernetes service that provides scalability and portability for cloud-native applications. Customers can get started at just $10 per month and scale-up and save with our free control plane and inexpensive bandwidth. Our Managed Container Registry offering lets customers easily store and manage private container images for rapid deployment to our Managed Kubernetes service. 
•App Platform: App Platform, launched in October 2020, is a PaaS offering that allows customers to build, deploy and scale applications quickly using a simple, fully-managed solution. We handle the infrastructure, application runtimes and dependencies so that developers can push code to production in just a few clicks, enabling them to deliver applications to market faster and on a global scale. 
•Serverless: In September 2021, we acquired Nimbella, a serverless platform provider. Serverless computing has become a popular trend in cloud application development because it allows for freedom from server management and the ability to pay only for what you use. We intend to leverage our App Platform product to launch an integrated serverless compute offering in 2022, which will simplify the cloud programming experience and help developers and SMBs focus more on application development and business outcomes and less on managing the underlying infrastructure.
Storage Offerings. Our storage solutions allow our customers to store and quickly access any amount of data reliably in the cloud. We offer several kinds of storage offerings, depending on the customer’s needs, including: 
•Spaces (Object Storage): Our object storage with a built-in content delivery network (CDN) makes scaling easy, reliable and affordable. Our simple and predictable pricing makes this offering very attractive compared to established public cloud providers. 
•Volumes (Block Storage): Our block storage product allows customers to add more storage space and mix and match compute and storage to suit their database, file storage, application, service, mobile and backup needs. This provides supplemental storage beyond the generous local solid-state drive (SSD) offered with our compute offerings. 
•Backups: Our automatically-created disk images of Droplets provide peace of mind and a sense of security to our customers. Our Backups offering allows weekly system-level backups, providing our customers with the ability to revert to an older state or create new Droplets. 
Networking Offerings. We provide a suite of networking capabilities to secure and control the traffic to our customers’ applications. Data transfer costs can quickly become a major expense for the developer of any reasonably complex cloud application. At DigitalOcean, we provide a generous amount of bandwidth with each successive Droplet purchase. This bandwidth is pooled for the customer’s account and shared by all applications or resources running in their account, which we believe is a key differentiator for us in the marketplace. Our key networking product offerings include: 
•Cloud Firewalls: Software service that allows customers to quickly secure their infrastructure from common vulnerabilities and define what services are visible on their infrastructure. Cloud Firewalls are free to our customers and are used for staging and production deployments of software. 
•Managed Load Balancers: Software service that allows customers to load balance traffic to their software applications located on multiple Droplets, enabling them to scale their applications and improve availability, security and performance across their infrastructure in a few clicks with affordable pricing. In late 2020, we launched a new version of this product that targets customers with larger-scale applications. 
•Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Private network interface for DigitalOcean resources collections. VPC networks provide a more secure connection between resources because the network is inaccessible from the public internet and other VPC networks, enabling our customers to manage their information and data traffic between applications without exposure to the public internet. Unlike many cloud providers, VPCs, including floating IP addresses, are available at no additional cost to our customers. 
Managed Databases. In 2019, we launched our Managed Database solution, which provides a fully-managed database. Managed Databases provide our customers with the application performance they need without the operational demands that come with building and running a database server. We currently offer managed offerings for relational databases (SQL) such as PostgreSQL & MySQL, as well as in-memory key-value data structure stores such as Redis. In addition, we offer DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB, a fully-managed database as a service offering in partnership with MongoDB.
The Developer Experience 
We believe that providing a differentiated developer experience is a critical element of our success. To ensure a positive developer experience, we provide rich content resources focused on optimizing cloud usage, a powerful and easy-to-use interface, and a variety of technology tools. This enables our customers to get started on DigitalOcean very quickly and easily and seamlessly expand their usage of our products and services as their needs evolve and scale. We believe this 
focus on helping our customers onboard and better utilize our products and services builds brand loyalty and generates referrals by our customers who are strong advocates for DigitalOcean around the world.
Our community education website contains thousands of detailed, high-quality technical tutorials written, edited and/or updated by our editorial team. These tutorials cover a wide range of topics relevant to developers, including programming how-tos for specific technical hurdles and guidance on the latest techniques to secure their computing environment. 
Our easy-to-use user interface enables customers to be up and running in the cloud in as little as three clicks and in less than a minute. We utilize intuitive application programming interfaces (APIs), command line interface (CLI) and plugins/integrations which automate interactions with our cloud platform. This allows customers to use popular tools like terraform to automate infrastructure as code to provision and manage their DigitalOcean deployments. All DigitalOcean products come with detailed product and technical documentation to help our customers deploy to our cloud platform more quickly. 
We provide management and collaboration tools to enable our customers to monitor and manage both their software and their team. We currently offer these tools free of charge to our customers as it drives brand loyalty and customer retention across our customer base. Our management and collaboration products include:
•Insights for Monitoring: Provides a turnkey visibility solution to seamless infrastructure monitoring. Customers can collect metrics to monitor Droplet performance and can receive alerts if infrastructure issues arise—with no configuration required.
•Projects: Allows our customers to organize their DigitalOcean resources (including Droplets, Spaces and Managed Load Balancers) into groups that fit the way they work. Customers can create projects that align with the applications, environments and clients they host on DigitalOcean. 
•Teams: Allows customers to securely and efficiently collaborate on projects with unlimited users, two-factor authentication and a single bill for all projects. 
We operate the DigitalOcean Marketplace, a platform where developers can find pre-configured applications and solutions quickly. Our Marketplace contains highly curated everyday applications and cutting-edge technologies, providing customers access to the most efficient tools to build their businesses while removing the time and expense of research, configuration and manual setup. We work closely with partners to deliver a truly seamless experience for customers, creating the ability for developers to deploy thoroughly tested app environments with the click of a button on Droplets and Kubernetes clusters. More than 200 preconfigured one-click applications are available in the Marketplace, including WordPress, LAMP, Docker, Grafana, and Plesk, among others.

We have been very successful in increasing our customer base and ARPU as we expand our product portfolio and optimize our sales, marketing and customer success and support initiatives. We had approximately 609,000 customers as of December 31, 2021, up from approximately 573,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 543,000 as of December 31, 2019. We had approximately 99,000 customers paying more than $50 per month as of December 31, 2021, up from approximately 80,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 68,000 as of December 31, 2019. Our ARPU has increased significantly, from $40.16 in 2019 to $47.78 in 2020 to $59.96 in 2021.
We have no material customer concentration, as our top 25 customers made up 10%, 9% and 10% of our revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Our Community 
We focus heavily on building a large highly engaged community that can connect and educate developers across the globe. Our developer community enables students, hobbyists and experienced developers alike the tools to learn new skills and technologies and create and deliver new applications. 
The DigitalOcean community is based on forging genuine relationships through a series of meaningful and memorable interactions. We foster our community through numerous initiatives, and believe these initiatives drive brand loyalty amongst a fast-growing developer community. We also believe that our focus on community engagement spurs our community followers to become advocates for us and our platform. 
Our community efforts are focused on educating, engaging and connecting the global developer and entrepreneurial communities, and can be grouped into three key categories: 
•Education: We operate a community education website which has grown significantly over the past few years, and attracts approximately 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. We offer more than 6,000 high-quality technical tutorials and a forum with approximately 30,000 questions and answers that guide developers in creating and delivering modern applications—not just focused on DigitalOcean products and services, but relevant to any cloud service. Our approach of giving back to the community “more than you receive” helps drive strong brand loyalty for DigitalOcean across the global developer community. 
•Events & Sponsorships: We support community learning, networking and interaction via targeted industry and customer events, as well as well as technical talks, regional events (which we call Tide conferences) and a virtual 24-hour conference (which we call Deploy). We have hosted Tide conferences in the U.S, India and Europe over the past several years and our third Deploy conference was held virtually in November 2021. In addition to these events, we honor and strengthen our commitment to the open source community via sponsorships that empower aspiring and evolving developers. Each year we host Hacktoberfest, which we believe is the largest hackathon in the world, with approximately 140,000 developers participating in 2021. We distribute our regular Currents market surveys to anyone who seeks market research trends about cloud and open source developments, whether they are a DigitalOcean customer or not. 
•Start-up Enablement: We also support entrepreneurs and start-ups more directly as they begin their journey. We operate the “Hatch by DigitalOcean” program, which furnishes high-potential start-ups with a robust set of benefits to help them succeed. We partner with some of the most prominent start-up incubators in the world and also accept direct applications to the Hatch program. The benefits we provide our Hatch companies include free infrastructure products and services, free technical support, and membership in our Hatch community that allows founders to collaborate and share learnings. Many of our Hatch participants graduate from the program and become loyal DigitalOcean customers. 
Marketing and Sales 
Our marketing and sales teams work together closely to drive awareness and adoption of our platform, accelerate customer acquisition and expand our revenue from existing customers. We believe we have built an incredibly efficient customer acquisition and expansion model. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our sales and marketing expense was approximately 12%, 11% and 12% of our revenue, respectively.
We have historically generated almost all of our revenue from our efficient self-service marketing model, which enables customers to get started on our platform very quickly and without the need for assistance. We focus heavily on enabling a self-service, low-friction model that makes it easy for users to try, adopt and use our products. By reducing the friction that typically accompanies the purchase of business software and eliminating the need for complicated and costly implementation and training, we have grown our customer base while avoiding the expensive customer acquisition costs typical of high-touch enterprise sales models. 
Our approach focuses on the self-service revenue funnel where we attract, convert and retain customers. By creating an intentional marketing experience for a prospect to travel through different stages of the funnel, we are able to anticipate their needs in real-time at each step. We attract visitors to our website through a combination of high-quality content, developer outreach and highly-targeted paid demand generation campaigns. We monitor and measure monthly unique visitors to our website based on the number of devices, such as a browser or a terminal, for which a unique and anonymous identifier (typically a first-party cookie) is sent with respect to each visit to our website in a given month. We convert those visitors to paying customers through website optimizations and experimentation. For existing customers, we conduct a variety of campaign strategies to ensure we retain and expand those customers. Our marketing department is broken into distinct areas: revenue marketing, which is responsible for generating self-service revenue through management of the funnel; product/programs marketing, which is responsible for marketing our products, developer relations and community engagement; content, which is responsible for managing the community and editorial teams; and social impact, which supports social impact initiatives through infrastructure credits, donations and community outreach. 
We complement our efficient self-service customer acquisition model with a small, targeted inside sales team that is focused on responding to inbound inquiries, outbound prospecting targeting specific use cases, volume expansion of our self-service customers, expanding our revenue in specific international markets and seeking partnership opportunities to drive revenue growth. We utilize a process-oriented and data-driven approach to sales that includes tracking numerous metrics such as sales conversion rates, velocity and time-to-close, and size of sales pipeline. Our sales team includes experienced sales engineers who fashion technical solutions for customers to convert their workloads from other cloud providers. Our marketing team supports lead generation efforts for sales by creating downloadable guides, tech talks and other content, and creating campaigns to nurture leads through our marketing funnel.
We intend to continue to invest in our marketing and sales capabilities to capitalize on our large and global market opportunity, while remaining very efficient in terms of marketing and sales expense as a percentage of revenue. 
Our Customer Support and Service 
Providing unparalleled customer support has been a passion and priority since our founding, and we believe it is a strategic differentiator for us. Our goal is to help all of our customers achieve their objectives—whether they are an individual developer working on a personal project or an SMB launching a sophisticated new application. Customers cite our attentive support focus as a key driver of their decision to start and grow their business on our platform. 
Our customer success and support team is organized into two main teams: customer support and customer success. These teams provide 24x7 service and are also stationed in various time zones to provide uninterrupted support to our truly global customer base. 
The customer support team addresses account-related questions and provides high-quality technical advice and troubleshooting. Developers and engineers are a key part of the customer support team, and our technical support is—and always has been—available free of charge to all customers. The customer engagement with this customer support team also serves as an important feedback loop to our product and technology teams, helping us better understand the specific needs of individual developers and SMBs. This feedback has influenced, and will continue to influence, our product roadmap, the content strategy for our community tutorials and other business decisions. 
Once our customers reach a certain spending level with us, we support them with dedicated customer success advocates to ensure their satisfaction and expand their usage of our platform. Our customer success professionals focus on customer retention and customer expansion by adding value throughout the customer lifecycle as customers scale and expand their usage of our product portfolio. For example, if a customer supplements their Droplets usage and initiates a Managed Database, our automated data science tool triggers an internal notification to our customer success advocates. In turn, a customer success advocate will directly contact the customer to determine if there are ways for us to augment their database with an additional service such as Managed Kubernetes. 
We closely track various metrics to ensure we are providing exceptional customer support. Our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which we measure by conducting a randomized survey of our paid customers in which customers could 
respond with a rating of 0 to 10 regarding their willingness to recommend us, averaged 63 during 2021. This NPS score is comparable to some of the world’s most beloved brands. We also internally monitor our customer satisfaction score, or CSAT, to gauge the quality of our interactions with customers and our ability to increase loyalty. We also have specific monthly service-level objectives (SLOs) for response and resolution times to ensure we maintain a high level of customer satisfaction. 
Competition 
The markets that we serve are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. With the introduction of new technologies and innovations, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense. 
We believe that the principal factors on which we compete include: 
•ease of use and operation; 
•speed of deployment; 
•price, total cost of ownership and transparency; 
•customer experience, support and service; 
•community engagement and education; 
•features, functionality and quality of tools; 
•performance, reliability, scalability and security; 
•brand awareness and reputation; 
•geographic reach; and 
•open source support. 
We compete primarily with large, diversified technology companies that focus on large enterprise customers and provide cloud computing as just a portion of the products and services that they offer. The primary vendors in this category include Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), Google (GCP), IBM and Oracle. These competitors are large, well-known public companies with greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources, and they possess considerably more customer awareness than we do. 
We also compete with smaller and/or niche cloud service providers that typically target individuals and smaller businesses, simple use cases and/or narrower geographic markets. Examples in this category include OVH, Vultr, Heroku and Linode. 
Despite the competitive intensity, we believe we compete successfully on the basis of the factors listed above. We focus solely on solutions for individual developers, start-ups and SMBs—and combine the power of simplicity, love for the developer community, an obsession for customer service and the advantages of open source. This differentiates us dramatically from the enterprise cloud competitors. At the same time, our ability to address complex use cases that allows customers to scale with us as they grow differentiates us from the many niche competitors who have less robust and extensible offerings. 
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality provision, non-disclosure agreements with third parties and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand. We use open source software in our services. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned nine registered trademarks in the United States and nine registered trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. We have filed applications for registration for one additional trademark in the United States and six additional trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we own one International Registration through the World Intellectual Property Organization, which has been extended to registrations in three additional jurisdictions and could be extended in another six jurisdictions. All of the foregoing applications were pending as of December 31, 2021. As we further expand internationally, we may be unable to register or obtain the right to use the DigitalOcean trademark in certain jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, we owned two issued patents and had three 
patent applications pending for examination in the United States, as well as a non-U.S. PCT application. The issued patents are each scheduled to expire in 2039 and the pending patent applications, if issued, would be scheduled to expire in 2039 and 2040. In addition, we license third-party software and use open source software and other technologies that are used in the provision of or incorporated into some elements of our services. Many parts of our business utilize proprietary technology and/or licensed technology, including open source software. 
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors and partners. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers, vendors and other partners. Our use of open source software, and participation in open source projects, may also limit our ability to assert certain of our intellectual property and proprietary rights against third parties, including competitors, who access or use software or technology that we have contributed to such open source projects. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property, including our use of open source software. 
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees and the culture we have established are critically important to our success. In order to continue to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. To support these objectives, we strive to maintain our company culture, offer competitive compensation and benefits, support the health and well-being of our employees, foster an inclusive, diverse and engaged workforce, and develop talent.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 786 employees, with 605 based in the United States and 181 located across Canada, Germany, India, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our Culture
We believe our culture is critical to our success and has delivered tangible financial and operational benefits for our customers, our employees and our stockholders. Our values guide our business, our product development, our practices and our brand. In 2021, we were recognized in Inc. Magazine’s annual list of Best Workplaces for 2021 and as one of Newsweek’s Most Loved Workplaces list for 2021. As our company continues to evolve and grow, our core values remain constant:
•Our community is bigger than just us. The global community of software developers and entrepreneurs have been the foundation and inspiration for everything we do.
•Simplicity in all we DO. Simplicity is a core value to us because it is a reminder to keep our customers top of mind in everything we do.
•We speak up when we have something to say and listen when others DO. With a focus on transparency and inclusivity, we want DigitalOcean to be a place where employees know where we stand and no matter a person’s background or experiences, employees can find their voice and their place here. 
•We are accountable to deliver on our commitments. Our customers, employees and investors place enormous trust in us, and we have to be accountable to deliver to all of you.
•Love is at our core. The love for our customers and for what we do in our jobs makes DigitalOcean a special place – you hear it in the voices of our customers and our employees every time they talk about DigitalOcean.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees globally. Our compensation package includes base salary, cash bonuses, commissions (for our sales team), and long-term equity awards. We offer all full-time employees equity at the time of hire and the ability to earn additional equity through promotion and annual grants, and provide employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan, to foster a strong sense of ownership and align our employees’ interests with our long-term success. We maintain a global compensation program that is intended to promote a pay-for-performance culture that is both internally equitable as well as externally competitive.
In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees a wide array of benefits designed to be aligned with local reward practices and competitive with those offered by companies that we compete with for talent. In the United States, these include health insurance, unlimited vacation, retirement benefits, a generous parental leave program, and additional resources to support employees' overall well-being. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits may vary in other countries due to local regulations and preferences.
Remote-Friendly Work
Since our inception, we have fostered a remote-friendly work culture that enables us to recruit and retain skilled professionals wherever they are located. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, our remote workforce represented a majority of our total employee base and an even higher percentage across our technology personnel. Operating remotely allows us access to a global talent pool that enables us to hire talented team members, regardless of location, providing a strong competitive advantage. Since March 2020, our entire workforce has operated remotely and our history and experience with managing a remote workforce has allowed us to continue to operate effectively and without interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, while we intend to remain a remote-first company, we have recently entered into an arrangement with a third party to allow employees the opportunity to access a shared work space to engage with other employees or customers. 
Health, Safety and Well-Being
We believe the health, safety and well-being of our employees is vital to our success. We have prioritized employee safety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to do so, ensuring all employees are set up to work remotely and providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines. In addition, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we promoted new and existing resources related to mental health and implemented a number of additional measures to support our employees, such as company-wide days off. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We have a strong commitment to building a diverse workforce that reflects our values and the needs of our global customer base. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce brings a diversity of perspectives, which in turn fosters innovation and helps drive better business outcomes. 
We have launched multiple initiatives to further our goal of being more diverse and inclusive and supporting a sense of belonging within our current workforce, including launching employee resource groups, or ERGs, which are employee-led, voluntary groups that support professional development, strengthen our business and advance our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace. We currently have ERGs to support women, LGBTQIA+, military and veterans, and early career professionals. We also focus on creating a diverse pipeline of candidates for open roles and partner with organizations including Out in Tech, Techqueria and Black Tech Pipeline to ensure our job postings reach a wide audience.
DigitalOcean is committed to pay equity, regardless of gender, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience and their job performance. 
In 2021, we published our first-ever diversity, equity, and inclusion report that highlighted our employee workforce data for 2020. Our goal is for our employee population to reflect the communities that we service from the perspective of race/ethnicity and gender, and ensuring equal total rewards opportunities for all employees regardless of gender identity, ethnicity, location, sexual orientation, disability status and more. We are committed to publishing our diversity numbers annually, as well as making improvements against our targets over time.
Talent Development
Talent development is a key aspect of the attraction and retention of our talent. We believe that employee growth is essential, and provide a number of resources and programs to support that commitment. Semi-annually, we facilitate employee review cycles where employees have development conversations with their managers. In addition, we provide new manager training to better equip managers to support their teams. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development.
Engagement
We conduct anonymous global engagement surveys regularly to help us understand the employee experience, identify areas of strength and development opportunities among teams, and measure the effectiveness of our people and culture initiatives, including relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These surveys are managed by a third-party vendor to encourage candor. The results are reviewed by senior management, who analyzes areas of progress or deterioration and works with their teams to determine which actions to take based on survey results.
Social Responsibility
In connection with our IPO in March 2021, we joined the Pledge 1% movement and committed to allocating $50 million over ten years to expand our social impact initiatives. We also recently hired a Vice President of Social Impact to develop our social impact strategy and to oversee and implement our social impact initiatives.
Our social impact framework is designed to improve the world through our products, our philanthropy and our focus on sustainability. The three key priorities across these areas are as follows:
•Product. Harness DigitalOcean technology, open source and technical expertise to support non-profit organizations, educational institutions, open source initiatives and others who are working to advance social good.
•Philanthropy. Make cash grants to organizations whose work is complementary to the DigitalOcean social impact framework, as well as launch a pilot employee volunteering program.
•Planet. Focus on environmental initiatives, such as reducing our carbon footprint and those of our partners and vendors over time.
