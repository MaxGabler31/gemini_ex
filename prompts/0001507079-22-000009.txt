Our Company
Founded in 2000, Floor & Decor is a high growth, differentiated, multi-channel specialty retailer and commercial flooring distributor of hard surface flooring and related accessories with 160 warehouse-format stores and two small design studios across 33 states. We believe that we offer the industry’s broadest in-stock assortment of tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, and natural stone flooring along with decorative and installation accessories and adjacent categories at everyday low prices positioning us as the one-stop destination for our customers’ entire hard surface flooring needs. We appeal to a variety of customers, including professional installers and commercial businesses (“Pro”), Do it Yourself customers (“DIY”), and customers who buy the products for professional installation (“Buy it Yourself” or “BIY”). We believe the majority of our BIY customers are homeowners. Our Pro customers are loyal, shop often and help promote our brand. The combination of our category and product breadth, low prices, in-stock inventory in project-ready quantities, proprietary credit offerings, integrated website and app, free design services, free storage options and dedicated customer service positions us to gain share in the attractive Pro customer segment. We believe our DIY customers spend significant time planning their projects while conducting extensive research in advance. We provide our customers with the education and inspiration they need before making a purchase through our differentiated online and in-store experience.
Our warehouse-format stores, which average approximately 78,000 square feet, are typically larger than any of our specialty retail flooring competitors’ stores. Other large format home improvement retailers only allocate a small percentage of their floor space to hard surface flooring and accessories. When our customers walk into a Floor & Decor store for the first time, we believe they are amazed by our visual presentation, our store size, our everyday low prices and the breadth and depth of our merchandise. We believe that our inspiring design studios, creative and informative visual merchandising, and accessible price points greatly enhance our customers’ experience. Our stores are easy to navigate and designed to interactively showcase the wide array of designs and product styles a customer can create with our flooring and decorative accessories. We engage our customers both through our trained store associates and designers who can assist in narrowing choices and making the process of home renovation easier, as well as our staff dedicated to serving Pro customers. By carrying a deep level of in-stock hard surface flooring inventory and wide range of tools and accessories, we seek to offer our customers immediate availability on everything they need to complete their entire flooring or remodeling project. In addition to our stores, our website FloorandDecor.com showcases our products, offers informational training and design ideas and has our products available for sale, which a customer can pick up in-store or have delivered. Our ability to purchase directly from manufacturers through our direct sourcing model enables us to be fast to market with a balanced assortment of bestseller and unique, hard to find items that are the latest trend-right products. We believe these factors create a differentiated value proposition for Floor & Decor and drive customer loyalty with our Pro, DIY and BIY hard surface flooring customers in our markets, as evidenced by our track record of consistent comparable store sales growth, which has averaged 12.6% over the last five years. Based on these characteristics, we believe Floor & Decor is redefining and expanding the addressable market size of the hard surface flooring category and that we have an opportunity to significantly expand our warehouse-format store base to at least 500 stores nationwide over the next 8 to 10 years, as described in more detail below.
Our Company was founded in 2000 by our Vice Chairman Vincent West, who opened the first Floor & Decor store in Atlanta, Georgia, with the vision of being the low-price leader for hard surface flooring. As we have grown, we have implemented a customer-focused and decentralized approach to managing our business. We provide our store leadership and regional operating teams with regular training and sophisticated information technology systems. We also train and incentivize our store associates to deliver a superior experience to our customers. Taken together, these elements create a customer-centric culture that helps us achieve our operational and financial goals.
Over the last several years, we have invested significant resources across our business and infrastructure to support innovation and growth. We believe that these investments will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and further differentiate Floor & Decor from our competition, positioning us for continued market share gains. We have made significant investments in product innovation across all categories, improving our assortment and seeking to provide more value to our Pro, DIY and BIY customers. We have also invested in e-commerce, technology and personnel to support our stores. We believe that our investments in our business will continue to improve our customer value proposition, differentiating us and strengthening our competitive advantage.
We believe our strong financial results are a reflection of our consistent and disciplined culture of innovation and reinvestment, creating a differentiated business model in the hard surface flooring category, as evidenced by the following:
•thirteen years of comparable store sales growth averaging 14.2% per year (and averaging 12.6% per year for fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021) with a 27.6% increase in fiscal 2021 compared to 5.5% for fiscal 2020;
•store base expansion from 83 warehouse-format stores at the end of fiscal 2017 to 160 warehouse-format stores and two small-format design studios at the end of fiscal 2021, representing a warehouse-format store compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17.8%; we added 27 warehouse-format stores during fiscal 2021, which was a 20% growth in warehouse-format stores compared to fiscal 2020;
•total net sales growth from $1.38 billion to $3.43 billion from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021, representing a CAGR of 25.5%; 
•net income growth from $102.8 million to $283.2 million from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021, representing a CAGR of 28.8%;
For additional discussion of our fiscal 2021 financial results, see Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our strengths, described below, set us apart from our competitors and are the key drivers of our success.
Unparalleled Customer Value Proposition. Our customer value proposition is a critical driver of our business. The key components include:
•Differentiated Assortment Across a Wide Variety of Hard Surface Flooring Categories. Our stores are generally larger than those of our specialty retail flooring competitors, and we allocate substantially more square footage to hard surface flooring and accessories than other large format home improvement retailers. We believe we have the most comprehensive in-stock, trend-right product assortment in the industry within our categories with on average approximately 4,200 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) in each store which, based on our market experience, is a far greater in-stock offering than any other flooring retailer. Additionally, we customize our product assortment at the store level for the regional preferences of each market. We have an ongoing product line review process across all categories that allows us to identify and interpret emerging trends in hard surface flooring. We work with our suppliers to quickly introduce new products and styles in our stores. We appeal to a wide range of customers through our “good/better/best” merchandise selection, as well as through our broad range of product styles from classic to modern, as well as new trend-right products. We consistently innovate with proprietary brands and products that appeal to certain customers with over 60 proprietary brands, including AquaGuard®, DuraLux®, and NuCore®.
•Low Prices. We provide everyday low prices in the retail hard surface flooring market. Our merchandising and individual store teams competitively shop each market so that we can offer our flooring products and related accessories at low prices. We also work with our vendors to identify and create new, affordable products in categories traditionally considered high-end to further democratize hard surface flooring by providing a greater number of options to a larger customer base. We believe we are unique in our industry in employing an “everyday low price” strategy, where we strive to offer our products at consistently everyday low prices throughout the year instead of engaging in frequent promotional activities. Our ability to provide these low prices is supported by our direct-sourcing model, which strives to eliminate third-party intermediaries and shortens time to market. We believe this strategy creates trust with our Pro, DIY and BIY customers because they consistently receive low prices at Floor & Decor without having to wait for a sale or negotiate to obtain the lowest price.
•One-Stop Project Destination with Immediate Availability. We carry an extensive range of products, including flooring and decorative accessories, as well as installation accessories such as thin set, underlayment, grout and tools, to fulfill a customer’s entire flooring project. More recently, we added adjacent categories such as vanities, bathroom accessories, frameless glass in the bathroom, and customized countertops for the kitchen. Our large in-stock assortment, including decorative and installation accessories, differentiates us from our competitors. Our stores stock job-size quantities to immediately fulfill a customer’s entire flooring project. In the instance where a product is not available in the store, our four regional distribution centers and neighboring stores can quickly ship the product to meet a customer’s needs. On average, each warehouse-format store carries approximately 4,200 SKUs, which equates to 1.1 million square feet of flooring products or $2.3 million of inventory at cost. Customers also have access to all of our inventory for in-store pick up or delivery through FloorandDecor.com.
Unique and Inspiring Shopping Environment. Our stores average approximately 78,000 square feet and are typically designed with warehouse features including high ceilings, clear signage, bright lighting and industrial racking and are staffed with knowledgeable store associates. We offer an easy-to-navigate store layout with clear lines of sight and departments organized by our major product categories of tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, natural stone, decorative accessories and installation accessories and smaller, adjacent categories for the bathroom and kitchen. We believe our unique signage, which clearly displays individual product features and benefits, improves the ease of shopping and facilitates customer decision making. We invest heavily in large, visually inspiring merchandise displays that showcase our assortment as well as point of sale marketing throughout our stores to highlight product features, benefits and design elements. These features educate and enable customers to visualize how the product would look in their homes or businesses. Furthermore, we encourage customers to interact with our merchandise, to experiment with potential designs and to see the actual product they will purchase, an experience that is not possible in flooring stores that do not carry in-stock inventory in project-ready quantities. The majority of our stores have design studios, with multiple different vignettes that showcase project ideas to further inspire our customers, and we employ experienced designers in all of our stores to provide free design consulting. Additionally, we provide a robust online experience for potential customers on FloorandDecor.com. For our DIY customers, we also offer weekly “how-to” installation classes on Saturdays. We believe inspiring and educating customers within our stores and on our website provides us with a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers.
Extensive Service Offerings to Enhance the Pro Customer Experience. Our focus on meeting the unique needs of the Pro customer, and by extension the BIY customer, drives our sales mix for Pro and BIY customers, which we believe represents a higher percentage than our competitors. We generate approximately 70% of our sales from homeowners and 30% of our sales from Pros; however, when looking at who determines where to shop, the Pro influences approximately 40% of our sales while homeowners influence approximately 60% our sales. We also estimate that approximately 85% of these flooring purchases will involve a Pro installation. We provide an efficient one-stop shopping experience for our Pro customers, offering low prices on a broad selection of high-quality flooring products, deep inventory levels to support immediate availability of our products, financial credit, free storage for purchased inventory, the convenience of early store hours and, in most stores, separate entrances for merchandise pick-up. We also offer Design Services to our Pro customer to support them in servicing their customers. Additionally, each store has a dedicated Pro sales force with technology to service our Pro customer more efficiently. We have a Pro loyalty rewards program, which provides business-building tools and awards points based on purchases. We believe rewarding our Pro customers through this program improves their loyalty to Floor & Decor, and by serving the needs of Pro customers, we drive repeat and high-ticket purchases, customer referrals, and brand awareness from this attractive and loyal customer segment. We offer commercial credit terms to some of our larger Pro customers, and in late 2020, we added a unique commercial credit card offering for our Pros'.
Decentralized Culture with an Experienced Store-Level Team and Emphasis on Training. We have a decentralized culture that empowers managers at the store and regional levels to make key decisions to maximize the customer experience. Our store managers, who carry the title Chief Executive Merchant (“CEM”), have significant flexibility to customize product mix, pricing, marketing, merchandising, visual displays and other elements in consultation with their regional leaders. We create or implement localized assortments that are not only trend forward but often create trends in the industry, which we believe differentiates us from our national competitors that tend to have standard assortments across markets. Throughout the year, we train all of our employees on a variety of topics, including product knowledge, sales strategies, leadership and store operations. Our store managers and store department managers are an integral part of our company, and many have over 15 years of relevant industry experience in retail. We have made important investments in the training and development of our people, including the creation of a full time training department. Approximately 70% of our new store management positions are filled through internal promotions, including 96% of our CEMs. We also have incentive compensation programs and an employee stock purchase plan for all employees, regardless of position or title. We train prospective store managers at our CEM Leadership Workshop, which is part of an extensive training program. Once a year, we hold a multiple day training session with our senior management, regional directors and CEMs, where we focus on the upcoming year’s strategic priorities to keep our entire business aligned. We believe our decentralized culture and coordinated training foster an organization aligned around providing a superior customer experience, ultimately contributing to higher net sales and profitability.
Sophisticated, Global Supply Chain. Our merchandising team has developed direct sourcing relationships with manufacturers and quarries in 24 countries. Through these relationships, we believe we understand the best places to procure our various product categories. We currently source our products from more than 240 vendors worldwide and have developed long-term relationships with many of them. We often collaborate with our vendors to design and manufacture products for us to address emerging customer preferences that we observe in our stores and markets. We procure the majority of our products directly from the manufacturers, which eliminates additional costs from exporters, importers, wholesalers and distributors. We believe direct sourcing is a key competitive advantage, as many of our specialty retail flooring competitors are too small to have the scale or the resources to work directly with suppliers. We have established a Global Sourcing and Compliance Department to, among other things, enhance our policies and procedures with respect to addressing compliance with appropriate regulatory bodies, including compliance with the requirements of the Lacey Act of 1900 (as amended, the “Lacey Act”), the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our Compliance Department also addresses compliance with Floor & Decor’s supplier compliance policies, such as specifications and packaging of the products we purchase. We also utilize third-party consultants for audits, testing and surveillance to ensure product safety and compliance. Additionally, we have invested in technology and personnel to collaborate throughout the entire supply chain process to support our direct sourcing model, which has improved our ability to find, manage and source trend-right merchandise quickly and at lower costs, allowing us to offer products at low prices while maintaining attractive gross margins.
Highly Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record. Led by our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Taylor, our management team brings substantial expertise from leading retailers and other companies across various core functions, including store operations, merchandising, marketing, real estate, e-commerce, supply chain management, finance, legal and information technology. Tom Taylor, who joined us in 2012, spent 23 years at The Home Depot, where he served as Executive Vice President of Merchandising and Marketing with responsibility for all stores in the United States and Mexico. Over the course of his career at The Home Depot, Tom Taylor helped expand the store base from fewer than 15 stores to over 2,000 stores. Our President, Lisa Laube, plans to retire this year after a successful career of over 30 years in retail, including the last 10 years at Floor & Decor, where she has led an experienced and successful team of merchants and other leaders. Our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Trevor Lang, brings more than 25 years of accounting and finance experience, including 20 years of Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance experience at public companies, including the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer of Zumiez Inc. Our entire management team drives our organization with a focus on strong merchandising, superior customer experience, expanding our store footprint, and fostering a strong, decentralized culture. We believe our management team is an integral component of our achieving strong financial results.
Our Growth Strategy
We expect to continue to drive our strong net sales and profit growth through the following strategies:
Open Warehouse-Format Stores in New and Existing Markets. We believe there is an opportunity to significantly expand our warehouse-format store base to at least 500 in the United States over the next 8 to 10 years from 160 as of December 30, 2021 based on our internal research with respect to housing density, demographic data, competitor concentration and other variables in both new and existing markets. We plan to target new store openings in both new and existing, adjacent and underserved markets. We have a disciplined approach to new store development, based on an analytical, research-driven site selection method and a rigorous real estate approval process. We believe our new store model delivers strong financial results and returns on investment, targeting net sales on average of $14 million to $16 million and a minimum of $2.5 million in four-wall adjusted EBITDA before pre-opening expenses in the first year, pre-tax payback in approximately two and a half to three and a half years and cash-on-cash returns of approximately 50% in the third year. Over the past several years, we have made significant investments in personnel, information technology, supply chain, warehouse infrastructure, Pro, commercial, design and connected customer strategies to support our current growth and the expansion of our stores. We intend to grow our store base by approximately 20% annually for the next several years. The performance of our new stores opened over the last three years, the performance of our older stores over that same time frame, our disciplined real estate strategy, and the track record of our management team in successfully opening retail stores support our belief in the significant store expansion opportunity.
Increase Comparable Store Sales. We expect to grow our comparable store sales by continuing to offer our customers a dynamic and expanding selection of compelling, value-priced hard surface flooring and accessories while maintaining strong service standards for our customers. We regularly introduce new products into our assortment through our category product line review process, including collaboration with our vendors to bring to market innovative products such as waterproof rigid core vinyl and water-resistant laminates. Because almost 60% of our stores have been opened for less than five years, we believe they will continue to drive comparable store sales growth as newer stores ramp up to maturity. We believe that we can continue to enhance our customer experience by focusing on service, optimizing sales and marketing strategies, investing in store staff and infrastructure, remodeling existing stores and improving visual merchandising and the overall aesthetic appeal of our stores. We also believe that growing our proprietary credit offering, Pro and designer strategies, further integrating connected customer strategies, and enhancing other key information technology, will contribute to increased comparable store sales. As we increase awareness of Floor & Decor’s brand, we believe there is a significant opportunity to gain additional market share, especially from independent flooring retailers and large format home improvement retailers. We have also added adjacent categories that align with flooring projects like vanities, bathroom accessories, frameless glass in the bathroom, and customized countertops for the kitchen. We believe the combination of these initiatives plus the expected growth of the hard surface flooring category described in more detail under “Our Industry” below will continue to drive comparable store sales growth.
Expand Our “Connected Customer” Experience. Floor & Decor’s online experience allows our Pro, BIY and DIY customers to explore our product selection and design ideas before and after visiting our stores and offers the convenience of making online purchases for delivery or pick up in-store. We believe our online platform reflects our brand attributes and provides a powerful tool to educate, inspire and engage our consumers, and we view our website and multi-channel strategies as leading our brand. Our research indicates that approximately 80% of customers who shopped at Floor & Decor in the last two years have visited our website. We continuously invest in our connected customer strategies to improve how our customers experience our brand. For example, we regularly enhance our website, which provides our customers with inspirational vignettes, videos, products, a room visualizer, education, and a faster online shopping experience. Additional initiatives include: (i) implementing our new Customer Relationship Management software ("CRM") to obtain a single view of our customers, (ii) developing personalized content based on location, purchase and browsing history, (iii) developing more relevant content and improved search and purchasing tools to help customers add decorative and installation accessories and (iv) creating frequently asked questions to help customers choose the best product for their jobs. We believe this reinforces our unique customer value proposition and ultimately drives sales. Our e-commerce sales represented approximately 16% of our total net sales for fiscal 2021. While the hard surface flooring category has a relatively low penetration of e-commerce sales due to the nature of the product, we believe our connected customer presence represents an attractive growth opportunity to drive consumers to Floor & Decor.
Continue to Invest in the Pro Customer. We believe our differentiated focus on Pro customers has created a competitive advantage for us and will continue to drive our net sales growth. We will invest in gaining and retaining Pro customers due to their frequent and high-ticket purchases, loyalty, and propensity to refer other potential customers. We have made important investments in the Pro services regional team, including the additional Regional Pro Directors, to better recruit and train the Pro services team in each store. We have also invested in technology, such as an integrated CRM, to help us further penetrate and grow our Pro business, dedicated phone lines for our Pro customers to call and text, commercial credit and open account terms, jobsite delivery, a dedicated website for Pro customers, a growing and successful Pro loyalty program, training on technical flooring installation solutions, and tools to facilitate large commercial jobs sourced throughout the store. We plan to further invest in initiatives to increase speed of service, financing solutions, leverage technology, elevate our Pro branding, dedicate additional store staffing to support Pro customers, and enhance the in-store experience for our Pro customers. We continue to invest in refreshing and expanding our Pro Premier Service area in the store to better facilitate our growing Pro business. Additionally, we communicate our value proposition and various Pro-focused offerings by hosting Pro networking events. In 2021, we made a concerted effort to better align our Pro and Design Services offering with technology and personnel. We believe Pro customers will continue to be an integral part of our sales growth.
Expand Our Sales Growth in Commercial Flooring. Building on our success in serving the Pro customer, in 2016, we entered the adjacent commercial sales channel, thereby increasing the size of the addressable market we serve. We believe the same attributes that have allowed us to be successful in selling residential retail hard surface flooring, which include high quality, trend-right hard surface flooring sourced at a low cost directly from the manufacturer, will allow us to grow in the commercial flooring market. We estimate our domestic addressable commercial flooring market, inclusive of installation categories, to be approximately $16 billion. We estimate that approximately 60% of the commercial market utilizes architectural and design firms as the primary decision maker for their hard surface flooring purchasing decisions, while the other 40% are owners, builders, developers, general contractors, and commercial flooring installers that make the primary decisions for hard surface flooring purchases. Prior to 2021, Floor & Decor sales representatives targeted corporate customers, large scale multi-family developers, large home builders, hotels, restaurants, and retailers and focused primarily on the 40% of the market described above. On June 4, 2021, we acquired Spartan Surfaces, Inc. (“Spartan”), a commercial specialty hard-surface flooring distribution company. Spartan focuses primarily on the architectural and design market mentioned above. We intend to continue to add commercial sales representatives to address the entire commercial flooring market.
Continue to Invest in Design Services. Our Design Services offer a unique to large format retail experience, which leads our customers through a seamless, inspirational design process to complete their projects. Our research tells us when a designer is involved, customer satisfaction is higher, the average ticket is approximately three times higher compared with customers who do not use a designer, and design appointments close at a higher rate than typical transactions. We position our designers as experts through our inspirational content and promote design services through all channels. We intend to continue to invest in recruiting top design talent, training, tools and technology. Design-focused training is a priority to ensure our teams are knowledgeable and prepared to deliver a start-to-finish consultative selling experience. We believe the planned rollout of our CRM technology to our design teams this year will enhance communication and workflow, from initial customer interaction through securing the close of the sale and beyond. Recent realignment within the regional store leadership organization to support design is expected to amplify the effectiveness of influence and high-level strategic execution. Additionally, we intend to continue to test advanced service options in various markets to further set us apart.
Enhance Margins Through Increased Operating Leverage. Since 2011, we have invested significantly in our sourcing and distribution network, integrated IT systems and corporate overhead to support our growth. Over time, we expect to leverage these investments as we grow our net sales. Additionally, we believe operating margin improvement opportunities will include enhanced product sourcing processes and overall leveraging of our store-level fixed costs, existing infrastructure, supply chain, corporate overhead and other fixed costs resulting from increased sales productivity. We anticipate that the planned expansion of our store base and growth in comparable store sales will also support increasing economies of scale over the long-term.
Our Industry
Floor & Decor operates in the large, growing and highly fragmented $24 billion U.S. floor coverings market (in manufacturers’ dollars) based on internal and external research, including 2021 reports by Market Insights, LLC, and Catalina Research, Inc., leading providers of market research for the floor coverings industry. We estimate that, after retail markup, the addressable hard surface flooring market for Floor & Decor is approximately $30 billion. Inclusive of installation materials and tools, which we internally estimate at $11 billion, our combined total addressable market (“TAM”) is approximately $41 billion. We estimate that the $41 billion TAM comprises approximately $25 billion in residential remodel and repair spending and $16 billion in commercial spending. The TAM does not include adjacent categories, which we estimate could represent another $8 billion to $13 billion. 
We believe we benefit from growth in the overall hard surface flooring market, which increased on average 4% per year from 2016 to 2021. The market declined about 2% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The market is estimated to grow on average 4% through 2026, assuming supportive housing and economic metrics remain intact. We believe that growth in the hard surface flooring market will continue to be driven by several home remodeling demand drivers. These include a large supply of aging homes, millennials entering their household formation years, existing-home sales growth from the low supply of housing inventory, rising home equity values, and the secular shift from carpet to hard surface flooring. In addition, we believe we have an opportunity to increase our market share as many of our competitors are unable to effectively compete with our combination of price, service, and broad in-stock assortment. The competitive landscape of the hard surface flooring market includes big-box home improvement centers, national and regional specialty flooring retailers, and independent flooring retailers. We estimate we represented approximately 8% of the TAM in 2021, increasing from approximately 6% in 2020.
Over the last decade, hard surface flooring has consistently taken market share from carpet as a percentage of the total floor coverings market, increasing from 50% in 2016 to 57% in 2021. Historically, the mix shift towards hard surface flooring has been driven by product innovation, changing consumer preferences, better hygiene qualities, increasing ease of installation, and higher durability. Product innovation, which has been aided by the increasing use of technology such as inkjet tile printing, waterproof wood-look flooring, and water-resistant laminates, and non-traditional uses of hard surface flooring including walls, fireplaces, and patios, has increased the size of the hard surface flooring market.

2016 | 2021

    
We believe we have an opportunity to continue to gain share in the hard surface flooring market with the largest selection of tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, natural stone, decorative accessories, and installation materials. Our strong focus on the customer experience drives us to remain innovative and locally relevant while maintaining low prices and in-stock merchandise in a one-stop shopping destination.
Our Products
We offer an assortment of tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, and natural stone flooring along with decorative accessories and wall tiles, installation materials, and adjacent categories at everyday low prices. Our objective is to carry a broad and deep in-stock product offering in order to be the one-stop destination for our customer’s entire project needs. We seek to showcase products in our stores and online to provide multiple avenues for inspiration throughout a customer’s decision-making process.
Our strategy is to fulfill the product needs of our Pro, DIY and BIY customers with our extensive assortment, in-stock inventory and merchandise selection across a broad range of price points. We offer bestseller products in addition to the more unique, hard to find items that we believe our customers have come to expect from us. We source our products from around the world, constantly seeking new and exciting merchandise to offer our customers. Our goal is to be at the forefront of hard surface flooring trends in the market, while offering low prices given our ability to source directly from manufacturers and quarries.
We utilize a regional merchandising strategy in order to carry products in our stores that cater to the preferences of our local customer base. This strategy is executed by our experienced merchandising team, which consists of category merchants and regional merchants, who work with our individual stores to ensure they have the appropriate product mix for their location. Our category merchants are constantly seeking new products and following trends by attending trade shows and conferences, as well as by meeting with vendors around the world. We schedule regular meetings to review information gathered and make future product decisions. This constant connectivity between our stores, regional merchants, category merchants, and our vendors allows us to quickly bring new, innovative, and compelling products to market.

Stores
We operate 160 warehouse-format stores across 33 states and two small-format design studios. Most of our stores are situated in highly visible retail and industrial locations. Our warehouse-format stores average approximately 78,000 square feet and carry on average approximately 4,200 flooring, decorative and installation accessory SKUs, which equates to approximately 1.1 million square feet of flooring products or $2.3 million of inventory at cost.
Each of our stores is led by a store manager who holds the title CEM and is supported by an operations manager, product category department managers, a design team, and a Pro sales and support team. Our store management focuses on providing superior customer service and creating customized store offerings that are tailored to meet the specific needs of their stores. Beyond the store managers, each store is staffed with associates, the number of whom vary depending on sales volume and size of the store. We dedicate significant resources to training our new store managers through our CEM Training Workshop and in the field across all product areas, with store-level associates receiving certification on specific product areas. Ongoing training and continuing education are provided for all employees throughout the year.
We believe there is an opportunity to significantly expand our store base in the United States from our 160 warehouse-format stores currently to at least 500 nationwide over the next 8 to 10 years based on our internal research with respect to housing density, demographic data, competitor concentration and other variables in both new and existing markets. For the next several years, we plan to grow our store base by approximately 20% per year, with a mix being opened in existing geographies and the others being opened in new markets. We have developed a disciplined approach to new store development, based on an analytical, research-driven method to site selection and a rigorous real estate review and approval process. By focusing on key demographic characteristics for new site selection, such as aging of homes, length of home ownership and median income, we expect to open new stores with attractive returns.
When opening new stores, inventory orders are placed several months prior to a new store opening. Significant investment is made in building out or constructing the site, hiring and training employees in advance, and advertising and marketing the new store through pre-opening events to draw the flooring industry community together. Each new store is thoughtfully designed with store interiors that include interchangeable displays on wheels, racking to access products and stand-up visual displays to allow ease of shopping and an exterior highlighted by a large, bold Floor & Decor sign. The majority of our stores have design studios that showcase project ideas to further inspire our customers, and, in all of our stores, we employ experienced designers to provide design consulting to our customers free of charge. Additionally, we have rolled out “Pro Zones”, which are dedicated areas offering a variety of services to Pro customers, in a majority of our stores.
Our new store model targets a store size of 70,000-80,000 square feet, total initial net cash investment of approximately $8 million to $10 million, which could increase as we have the ability to own and self-develop more new stores, net sales on average of $14 million to $16 million and a minimum of $2.5 million in four-wall adjusted EBITDA before pre-opening expenses in the first year, pre-tax payback in approximately two and a half to three and a half years and cash-on-cash returns of approximately 50% in the third year. We believe the success of our stores across geographies and vintages supports the portability of Floor & Decor into a wide range of markets. The performance of our new stores is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that our new stores will achieve our target results.
Connected Customer
We aim to elevate the total customer experience through our website FloorandDecor.com. Growing our e-commerce sales provides us with additional opportunity to enhance our connected customer experience. Home renovation and remodeling projects typically require significant investments of time and money from our DIY customers, and they consequently plan their projects carefully and conduct extensive research online. FloorandDecor.com is an important tool for engaging our DIY customers throughout this process, educating them on our product offerings and providing them with design ideas. Our Pro customers use the website and our Pro app to browse our broad product assortment, to continually educate themselves on new techniques and trends and to share our virtual catalogue and design ideas with their customers and utilize tools such as our calculators to aid with shopping. In addition, sales associates at our call center are available to assist our customers with their projects and questions. We designed the website to be a reflection of our stores and to promote our wide selection of high quality products and low prices. To this end, we believe the website provides not only the same region-specific product selection that customers can expect in our stores, but also the opportunity to extend our assortment by offering our entire portfolio of products.
In addition to highlighting our broad product selection, we believe FloorandDecor.com offers a convenient opportunity for customers to purchase products online and pick them up in our stores. Approximately 79% of our e-commerce sales are picked up in-store. As we continue to grow, we believe connected customer will become an increasingly important part of our strategy, and the investments we made in our connected customer strategy were particularly beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Marketing and Advertising
We use a multi-platform approach to increasing Floor & Decor’s brand awareness, while historically maintaining a low average advertising to net sales ratio of approximately 3%. We use traditional advertising media, combined with social media and online marketing, to share the Floor & Decor story with a growing audience. We take the same customized approach with our marketing as we do with our product selection; each region has a varied media mix based on local trends and what we believe will most efficiently drive sales. To further enhance our targeting efforts, our store managers have input into their respective stores’ marketing spend.
A key objective of our messaging is to make people aware of our stores, products and services. Based on our internal research, we estimate the conversion rate from a customer visiting one of our stores or our website to purchasing our products is 84%.
As part of our focus on local markets, our stores have events that promote Floor & Decor as a hub for the local home improvement community. We feature networking events for Pro customers, giving them a chance to meet our sales teams, interact with others in the home improvement industry and learn about our newest products. For DIY customers, we regularly offer how-to classes on product installation. We believe these events serve to raise the profile of the Floor & Decor stores in our communities while showcasing our tremendous selection of products and services.
We want our customers to have a great experience at their local Floor & Decor store. Through our TV and radio commercials, print and outdoor ads, in-store flyers, online messaging and community events, we show our customers that we are a trusted resource with a vast selection, all at a low price.
Sourcing
Floor & Decor has a well-developed and geographically diverse supplier base. We source our industry leading merchandise assortment from over 240 suppliers in 24 countries. Our largest supplier accounted for 17% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, while no other individual supplier accounted for more than 6% of our net sales. We are focused on bypassing agents, brokers, distributors, and other middlemen in our supply chain in order to reduce costs and lead time. We believe that our direct sourcing model and the resulting relationships we have developed with our suppliers are distinct competitive advantages. The cost savings we achieve by directly sourcing our merchandise enable us to offer our customers low prices.
We have established a Global Sourcing and Compliance Department to, among other things, develop and implement policies and procedures in order to address compliance with appropriate regulatory bodies, including compliance with the requirements of the Lacey Act, CARB, and the EPA. We utilize third-party consultants for audits, testing, and surveillance to ensure product safety and compliance. We have invested in technology and personnel to collaborate throughout the entire supply chain process. Additionally, our close relationships with suppliers allow us to collaborate with them directly to develop and quickly introduce innovative and quality products that meet our customers’ evolving tastes and preferences at low prices.
Distribution and Order Fulfillment
Merchandise inventory is our most significant working capital asset and is considered “in-transit” or “available for sale”, based on whether we have physically received the products at an individual store location or in one of our four distribution centers. In-transit inventory generally varies due to contractual terms, country of origin, transit times, international holidays, weather patterns and other factors, but approximately 25% of our inventory is in-transit, while roughly 75% is available for sale in our stores or at one of our four distribution centers.
We have invested significant resources to develop and enhance our distribution network. We have four distribution centers strategically located across the United States in port cities near Savannah, Georgia; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Baltimore, Maryland. Third-party brokers arrange the shipping of our international and domestic purchases to our distribution centers and stores and bill us for shipping costs according to the terms of the purchase agreements with our suppliers. We are typically able to transport inventory from our distribution centers to our stores in less than one week. This turnaround time enhances our ability to maintain project-ready quantities of the products stocked in our stores. All of our distribution centers are Company-operated facilities, and we have implemented a warehouse management and transportation management system tailored to our unique needs across all four distribution centers. We believe this system helps service levels, reduces shrinkage and damage, helps us better manage our inventory, and allows us to better implement our connected customer initiatives.
We began operating a 1.5 million square foot leased distribution center in Baltimore, Maryland in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We completed the relocation of our existing distribution center near Houston, Texas to a larger distribution center in the Houston area in January of fiscal 2022. We plan to continue to seek further opportunities to enhance our distribution capabilities and align them with our strategic growth initiatives.
Management Information Systems
We believe that technology plays a crucial role in the continued growth and success of our business. We have sought to integrate technology into all facets of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, store operations, point-of-sale, e-commerce, finance, accounting and human resources. The integration of technology allows us to analyze the business in real time and react accordingly. Our sophisticated inventory management system is our primary tool for forecasting, placing orders and managing in-stock inventory. The data-driven platform includes sophisticated forecasting tools based on historical trends in sales, inventory levels and vendor lead times at the store and distribution center level by SKU, allowing us to support store managers in their regional merchandising efforts. We rely on the forecasting accuracy of our system to maintain the in-stock, project-ready quantities that our customers rely on. In addition, our employee training certifications are entirely electronic, allowing us to effectively track the competencies of our staff and manage talent across stores. We believe that our systems are sufficiently scalable to support the continued growth of the business.
Competition
The retail hard surface flooring market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from large home improvement centers, national and regional specialty flooring chains and independent flooring retailers. Some of our competitors are organizations that are larger, are better capitalized, have existed longer, have product offerings that extend beyond hard surface flooring and related accessories, and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. In addition, while the hard surface flooring category has a relatively low threat of new internet-only entrants due to the nature of the product, the growth opportunities presented by e-commerce could outweigh these challenges and result in increased competition in this portion of our connected customer strategy. Further, because the barriers to entry into the hard surface flooring industry are relatively low, manufacturers and suppliers of flooring and related products, including those whose products we currently sell, could enter the market and start directly competing with us.
We believe that the key competitive factors in the retail hard surface flooring industry include:
•product assortment;
•product innovation;
•in-store availability of products in project-ready quantities;
•product sourcing;
•product presentation;
•customer service;
•store management;
•store location; and
•low prices.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors by providing a highly diverse selection of products to our customers, at an attractive value, in appealing and convenient retail stores.
Our Structure
Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in October 2010 in connection with the acquisition of Floor & Decor Outlets of America, Inc. (“F&D”) in November 2010 by our previous sponsor owners.
The following chart illustrates our current corporate structure:
Human Capital
We have built a strong team of employees to support our continued success. Each of our stores is led by a CEM and is supported by an operations manager, product category department managers, a design team, a Pro sales and support team, and a number of additional associates. Outside of our stores, we have employees dedicated to corporate, store support, infrastructure, e-commerce, call center and similar functions as well as support for our distribution centers and sourcing office. We dedicate significant resources to training our employees and believe they are key to our success. Our Chief Human Resources Officer, supported by the entire executive team, is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent and the design of associate compensation and benefits programs.
As of December 30, 2021, we had 10,566 employees, 7,986 of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of the total employees, 9,201 work in our stores, 921 work in corporate, store support, customer care or similar functions, 432 work in distribution centers, and 12 work in our Asia sourcing office in Shanghai, China. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
We look at a variety of measures and objectives related to the development, attraction, safety, engagement, and retention of our employees, including:
•Store Staffing. In order to provide the level of customer service that we expect, it is important that we adequately staff our stores with trained employees. During fiscal 2021, we faced challenges recruiting staff for certain of our stores due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a challenging labor market. In response, we invested in Divisional Managers of Workforce & Talent to focus on supporting our stores in their staffing needs. As of December 30, 2021, the majority of our stores were staffed at a level that we deem appropriate.
•Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. We are mindful of the benefits of diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of the employment cycle and believe they are key to our culture and long-term success. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective talents, striving to ensure that all associates are treated with dignity and respect. In 2021, we significantly expanded the size of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team to lead our diversity and inclusion efforts.
•Training. We believe that training associates is also important to ensuring appropriate levels of customer service. We have a Learning Department, and in 2021, associates engaged in approximately 162,360 hours of training.
•Internal Advancement Opportunities. We believe our growth opportunities are a critical way to attract and retain employees, and we encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit. In 2021, 1,674 employees were promoted to more senior positions.
•Safety. Maintaining a safe shopping environment is very important to us. We have worked to ensure our stores are safe environments for both our customers and employees and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced various safety measures and protocols consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and state and local health authorities.
•Rewards. We believe in rewarding our associates for their hard work on behalf of Floor & Decor and provide a variety of incentives to allow associates to share in the Company’s success, including (i) incentive compensation plans for all associates, (ii) a 401(k) plan with Company-sponsored match, (iii) health care benefits for full-time associates, (iv) an employee stock purchase plan that facilitates purchases of Company stock by eligible associates, and (v) other benefits such as an employee assistance program.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to employment, the environment, protection of natural resources, import and export, advertising, labeling, public health and safety, product safety, zoning and fire codes. We operate our business in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not historically had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results; however, the effect of compliance in the future cannot be predicted.
Our operations and properties are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the environment, environmental protection of natural resources and health and safety, including the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and wastes and relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties. Except to the extent of the capital expenditures related to our initiatives described below, compliance with these laws and regulations has not historically had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results, but we cannot predict the effect of compliance in the future.
In particular, certain of our products are subject to laws and regulations relating to the importation, exportation, acquisition or sale of certain plants and plant products, including those illegally harvested (which is prohibited by the Lacey Act), and the emissions of hazardous materials (which in California is governed by regulations promulgated by CARB and federally by regulations promulgated by the EPA). We have established a Global Sourcing and Compliance Department to, among other things, address these requirements, and we work with third-party consultants to assist us in designing and implementing compliance programs relating to the requirements of the Lacey Act, CARB and the EPA. Further, we could incur material compliance costs or be subject to compliance liabilities or claims in the future, especially in the event new laws or regulations are adopted or there are changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation.
Our suppliers are also subject to the laws and regulations of their home countries, including in particular laws regulating forestry and the environment. We also support social and environmental responsibility among our supplier community and endeavor to enter into vendor agreements with our suppliers that contain representations and warranties concerning environmental, labor and health and safety matters.
Insurance and Risk Management
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, team member healthcare benefits, and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in workers’ compensation and general liability premiums and deductibles, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Legal Proceedings
We are engaged in various legal actions, claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims related to breach of contracts, products liabilities, intellectual property matters and employment related matters resulting from our business activities. As with most actions such as these, an estimation of any possible and/or ultimate liability cannot always be determined. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
Trademarks and other Intellectual Property
As of February 24, 2022, we have 76 registered marks and several pending trademark applications in the United States. We regard our intellectual property, including our over 60 proprietary brands, as having significant value, and our brand is an important factor in the marketing of our products. Accordingly, we have taken, and continue to take, appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property.
