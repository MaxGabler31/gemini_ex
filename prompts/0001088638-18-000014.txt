 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available.
 The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, will, should and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guaranties of future performance. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions. We are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions include those discussed under Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis and Business. Although we have sought to identify the most significant risks to our business, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized, nor can there be any assurance that we have identified all possible issues which we might face. For all of these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law. We urge readers to review carefully the risk factors described in this Annual Report and in the other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can read these documents at www.sec.gov.
 Where we say we, us, our, Company or CoConnect, we mean CoConnect, Inc.
 Corporate History
 The Company was originally incorporated in Alabama in December 1997. Our original business plan was to take over the assets of businesses involved in reorganizations through bankruptcies. In 1997, we acquired Mobile Limited Liability Company as part of the confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. On August 6, 2000, we acquired all of the assets of Digital Wireless Systems, Inc. as part of the consummation of our confirmed Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Lack of funding forced us to abandon plans to revive the operations of both of these companies. In 2000, we acquired three operating subsidiaries: Daybreak Auto Recovery, Inc., Rap Group and Voltage Vehicles. In 2002, we rescinded these acquisitions, and in October 2004, we cancelled the common shares that were to be issued for the acquisitions, which shares had been held in escrow. During 2002 and 2003, we had no operations other than to continue our efforts to liquidate certain telecommunications licenses, our only assets, in order to pay creditors who had judgments arising out of the aforementioned bankruptcies. In August 2004, we reincorporated from Alabama to Nevada and changed our name to Advanced Wireless Communications, Inc. On October 5, 2004, we signed a definitive agreement with Heritage Communications, Inc. (Heritage) and acquired an exclusive license for the marketing and distribution of products over Heritages proprietary high-speed wireless network. On January 28, 2005, we executed a share exchange agreement with Heritage and its stockholders. The share exchange agreement closed on February 23, 2005 and superseded the exclusive license with Heritage by making Heritage our wholly owned subsidiary. In February 2005, we changed our name to CoConnect, Inc. On July 14, 2005, we rescinded the share exchange agreement with Heritage due to material omissions and misrepresentations that had been made by Heritage. As a result of the rescission, we cancelled the 30,000,000 shares of common stock previously issued to the stockholders of Heritage. On December 21, 2005, through our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Phoenix Asset Acquisition Corporation, we purchased selected assets of Phoenix Systems Corp. (Phoenix). The terms of the purchase included the issuance of 8,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 2,000,000 shares were being held in escrow until certain performance measures were achieved, a $50,000 cash payment, and the assumption of approximately $374,000 of Phoenix liabilities and approximately $49,000 in obligations related to real property leases. Effective December 31, 2005, the Phoenix transaction was rescinded by mutual agreement.  - 3 -     On December 12, 2008, a majority of the holders of our common shares voted to authorize a 1-for-12,000 reverse split of our common stock, which became effective on January 12, 2009. As a result of the reverse split, our trading symbol was changed to CCON effective March 10, 2009. Change-in-Control Transaction
 On February 14, 2018, we consummated a transactions pursuant to a Joint Venture Interest Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement) made and entered into as of February 14, 2018 by and among (i) CoConnect Inc., a Nevada Corporation (CoConnect), (ii) Mastermind Involvement Marketing, a Georgia joint venture (MIM), and (iii) Mastermind Marketing, Inc, a Georgia Corporation (MM Inc.), Digital Advize, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (Advize), and Villanta Corporation, a Georgia Corporation (Villanta, together with Advize and MM Inc., the Sellers).
 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement the Sellers contributed, transferred, assigned and conveyed to CoConnect all right, title and interest in and to one hundred percent (100%) of such joint venture interest in MIM (the Contributed Joint Venture Interest), together with any and all rights, privileges, benefits, obligations and liabilities appertaining thereto, reserving unto such Seller no rights or interests therein whatsoever, and (ii) CoConnect accepted the contribution of the Contributed Joint Venture Interest, and in consideration for such contribution the Sellers collectively were entitled to receive from CoConnect twenty-nine million two hundred thirty-six thousand seven hundred fifty-nine (29,236,759) of CoConnect s common stock, $.001 par value (the CoConnect Common Stock) representing eighty-five percent (85%) of the total outstanding CoConnect Common Stock after the issuance of the Contribution Consideration (the Contribution Consideration) with each Seller receiving for its respective percentage of Contributed Joint Venture Interest that same percentage of the Contribution Consideration (such transaction, the Business Combination). As a result of the Business Combination, the Sellers became the controlling shareholders of CoConnect and CoConnect became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the Business Combination, we were a shell company as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). As a result of the Business Combination, we ceased to be a shell company. The information contained in this Report constitutes the information necessary to satisfy the conditions contained in Rule 144(i)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). On February 22, 2018, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which fully describes the transaction set forth herein and is incorporated herein by reference.
 Business Operations Prior to Business Combination
 Prior to the Business Combination described above, which was consummated on February 14, 2018, we had no operations, and were engaged in efforts to identify an operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had no employees. Mr. Yankowitz has served as our sole officer and director from May 1, 2014 through February 14, 2018 and devoted approximately 10% of his time on an annual basis to managing our matters.
  Item 1A.
 Risk Factors
 The following risk factors apply to the business and operations of the Company. These risk factors are not exhaustive. Investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to the business, financial condition and prospects of the Company. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this Report. In particular, please refer to the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein.
 Risks Related to Capital Structure
 There is no assurance of an active established public trading market, which would adversely affect the ability of the Companys investors to sell their securities in the public market.
 Although the Companys common stock is registered under the Exchange Act and is traded on the OTC Market, an active trading market for the securities does not yet exist and may not exist or be sustained in the future. The OTC Market, also known as the Pink Sheets, is an over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than the NASDAQ Stock Market. Prices for securities traded solely on the OTC Market may be difficult to obtain and holders of common stock may be unable to resell their securities at or near their original offering price or at any price. Market prices for the Companys common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including:  · The Companys ability to obtain additional financing and the terms thereof;  - 4 -      · The Companys financial position and results of operations;  · Any litigation against the Company;  · Possible regulatory requirements on the Companys business;  · The issuance of new debt or equity securities pursuant to a future offering;  · Competitive developments;  · Variations and fluctuations in the Companys operating results;  · Change in financial estimates by securities analysts;  · The depth and liquidity of the market for the Companys common stock;  · Investor perceptions of the Company; and  · General economic and business conditions. Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock, as the future sale of a substantial amount of outstanding stock in the public marketplace could reduce the price of the Companys common stock.
 In excess of eighty-five percent (85%) of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding are owned by three stockholders who will be eligible to sell some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (Rule 144), subject to certain limitations commencing in one year. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities, without any limitations, by a non-affiliate that has satisfied a six-month holding period commencing one year after the Company is no longer a shell company. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock by creating an excessive supply. The Companys common stock is considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell.
 The Companys common stock is considered to be a penny stock since it meets one or more of the definitions in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-6 promulgated under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. These include but are not limited to the following: (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is NOT traded on a recognized national exchange; (iii) it is NOT quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per share; or (iv) it is issued by a company with net tangible assets less than $2.0 million, if in business more than a continuous three years, or with average revenues of less than $6.0 million for the past three years. The principal result or effect of being designated a penny stock is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the stock but must trade in it on an unsolicited basis. Additionally, Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15g-2 promulgated thereunder by the SEC require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investors account. Holders in the Companys common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be penny stock. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning its financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investors financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for holders of the Companys common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. The Company does not intend to pay dividends and stockholders may not experience a return on investment without selling their securities.
 The Company has never declared or paid, nor does it intend in the foreseeable future to declare or pay, any cash dividends on its common stock. Since the Company intends to retain all future earnings to finance the operation and growth of its business, stockholders will likely need to sell their securities in order to realize a return on their investment, if any.   - 5 -     As an emerging growth company under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave our stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.
 For as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act), we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to:  · not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  · taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;  · reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and  · exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies. The requirements of being a U.S. public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention.
 As a U.S. public company, we will be or become subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of NASDAQ, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that expressly authorized or required the SEC to adopt additional rules in these areas, such as an advisory shareholder vote to approve of our executives compensation (or Say on Pay), proxy access, and an advisory shareholder vote on how often we should include a Say on Pay proposal in our proxy materials for future annual shareholder meetings or any special shareholder meeting for which we must include executive compensation information in the proxy statement for that meeting. Our efforts to comply with these requirements are likely to result in an increase in expenses which is difficult to quantify at this time. As a result of disclosure in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert resources of our management and harm our business and operating results. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
 We are a development stage company with limited resources. Therefore, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For these reasons, we are considering the costs and benefits associated with improving and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, which includes (i) hiring additional personnel with sufficient U.S. GAAP experience and (ii) implementing ongoing training in U.S. GAAP requirements for our CFO and accounting and other finance personnel. If the results of these efforts are not successful, or if material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.
   - 6 -     Risks Relating to our Business and Industry
 A significant majority of our outstanding ordinary shares are held by a small number of shareholders, which may have significantly greater influence on us due to the size of their shareholdings relative to other shareholders.
 As of the date of this Report, MM Inc., Advize, and Villanta, beneficially own approximately 51%, 8.5%, 25.5%, respectively, of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. These major shareholders have significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and schemes of arrangement, election and removal of directors and other significant corporate actions. They may not act in our best interests or our minority shareholders interests. In addition, without the consent of these major shareholders, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us. This concentration of ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our ordinary shares. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders. Digital and Social Marketing is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. The econcomy affects corporate spending on digital and social marketing and any downturn could reduce the amount spent in these areas and our revenue.
 We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, and particularly from other companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising including companies that have in-house marketing groups. Currently, we consider our primary competitors to be Sapient Corporation d/b/a Sapient, Razorfish, DigitasLBi, and other digital/social agencies that work with fortune 500 brands. If our competitors are successful in providing similar or better services compared to ours, we could experience a significant decline in revenue.
 Additionally, many of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have more financial resources to develop new products and programs. Our business could be affected if one of our competitors or a new entrant to the market develops similar products and programs through similar marketing channels. This could result in lower sales as well as pricing competition which could adversely affect the Companys results from operations.
 Government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
 Government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
 Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. Any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
 Further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. The capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. Such market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.
 Volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can also create a challenging environment in which to raise or access debt capital. The reappearance of market conditions similar to those experienced from 2008 through 2009 for any substantial length of time could make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. The debt capital that will be available to us in the future, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than what we currently experience including being at a higher cost due to a rising rate environment. If we are unable to raise or refinance debt, then our equity investors may not benefit from the 
  - 7 -     potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or to fund existing commitments to our portfolio companies.
 Significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). Significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. Thus, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We operate in an ever-evolving industry and changes to it can have a material effect on our business model which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
 We derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of online marketing and media services, which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history. The industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly-changing Internet media, evolving industry standards, and changing user and client demands. Our business model is also evolving and is distinct from many other companies in our industry, and it may not be successful. As a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain. Although we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we may not be able to sustain current revenue levels or growth rates. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in an immature industry with an evolving business model such as ours. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to:
  ·
 maintain and expand client relationships;
  ·
 sustain and increase the number of visitors to our websites;
  ·
 sustain and grow relationships with third-party website publishers and other sources of web visitors;
  ·
 manage our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls;
  ·
 raise capital at attractive costs, or at all;
  ·
 acquire and integrate websites and other businesses;
  ·
 successfully expand our footprint in our existing client verticals and enter new client verticals;
  ·
 respond effectively to competition and potential negative effects of competition on profit margins;
  ·
 attract and retain qualified management, employees and independent service providers;
  ·
 successfully introduce new processes and technologies and upgrade our existing technologies and services;
  ·
 protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights; and
  ·
 respond to government regulations relating to the Internet, personal data protection, email, software technologies and other aspects of our business.
 If we are unable to address these risks, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer.
 If we do not effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients.
 We have experienced rapid growth in our operations and operating locations, and we expect to experience continued growth in our business, both through acquisitions and internal growth. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. In particular, continued rapid growth and acquisitions may make it more difficult for us to accomplish the following:
  ·
 successfully scale our technology to accommodate a larger business and integrate acquisitions;
  ·
 maintain our standing with key vendors, including Internet search companies and third-party website publishers;
  ·
 maintain our client service standards; and
  ·
 develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and maintain adequate reporting systems and procedures.
 In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations.   - 8 -     The improvements required to manage our growth will require us to make significant expenditures, expand, train and manage our employee base and allocate valuable management resources. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients, third-party website publishers and key personnel. We depend upon Internet search companies to attract a significant portion of the visitors to our websites, and any change in the search companies search algorithms or perception of us or our industry could result in our websites being listed less prominently in either paid or algorithmic search result listings, in which case the number of visitors to our websites and our revenue could decline.
 We depend in significant part on various Internet search and social media companies, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snap and others to distribute messaging and marketing of our clients. These websites typically allow for viral and paid distribution through algorithmic and paid listings. Algorithmic, or organic, postings/listings are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the respective social/search companies. Paid listings can be purchased and then are displayed if based on a users search/post. Placement on these services is generally not determined solely on the price, but also takes into account the search engines assessment of the quality of website featured in the paid listing and other factors. We rely on both algorithmic and paid results, as well as advertising on other websites, to direct a substantial share of the visitors to our websites.
 Our ability to maintain the number of visitors to our clients social properties and other websites is not entirely within our control. For example, Internet search websites frequently revise their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search result listings or to maintain their internal standards and strategies. Changes in the algorithms could cause our websites to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit our websites/social platforms. If visits/views to our websites/social platforms decrease, we may need to resort to more costly sources to replace lost visitors/engagement, and such increased expense could adversely affect our business and profitability.
 If we are unable to retain the members of our management team or attract and retain qualified management team members in the future, our business and growth could suffer.
 Our success and future growth depend, to a significant degree, on the continued contributions of the members of our management team. Each member of our management team is an at-will employee and may voluntarily terminate his or her employment with us at any time with minimal notice. We also may need to hire additional management team members to adequately manage our growing business. We may not be able to retain or identify and attract additional qualified management team members. Competition for experienced management-level personnel in our industry is intense. Qualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the Internet marketing industry, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. If we lose the services of any of our senior managers or if we are unable to attract and retain additional qualified senior managers, our business and growth could suffer.
 We need to hire and retain additional qualified personnel to grow and manage our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business and growth could be seriously harmed.
 Our performance depends on the talents and efforts of our employees specifically our CEO, Dan Dodson, EVP Michael Gelfond, and SVP Ricardo Rios. Our future success will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization and, in particular, in our engineering/technology, sales and marketing, media, finance and legal/regulatory teams. We plan to continue to grow our business and will need to hire additional personnel to support this growth. We have found it difficult from time to time to locate and hire suitable personnel. If we experience similar difficulties in the future, our growth may be hindered. Qualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the Internet marketing industry, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. Many of our employees have also become, or will soon become, substantially vested in their stock option grants. Employees may be more likely to leave us following our initial public offering as a result of the establishment of a public market for our common stock. If we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to succeed, our business and growth could be harmed.
 If we fail to compete effectively against other online marketing and media companies and other competitors, we could lose clients and our revenue may decline.
 The market for online marketing is intensely competitive. We expect this competition to continue to increase in the future. We perceive only limited barriers to entry to the online marketing industry. We compete both for clients and for limited high-quality advertising inventory. We compete for clients on the basis of a number of factors, including return on marketing expenditures, price, and client service.
 We compete with Internet and traditional media companies for a share of clients overall marketing budgets, including:
  ·
 online marketing or media services providers;
  ·
 offline and online advertising agencies;
  - 9 -      ·
 major Internet portals and search engine companies with advertising networks such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and AOL;
  ·
 other online marketing service providers, including online affiliate advertising networks and industry-specific portals or lead generation companies;
  ·
 website publishers with their own sales forces that sell their online marketing services directly to clients;
  ·
 in-house marketing groups at current or potential clients;
  ·
 offline direct marketing agencies; and
  ·
 television, radio and print companies.
 Competition for web traffic among websites and search engines, as well as competition with traditional media companies, could result in significant price pressure, declining margins, reductions in revenue and loss of market share. In addition, as we continue to expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of websites, clients and traditional media companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. Large Internet companies with brand recognition, such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and AOL, have significant numbers of direct sales personnel and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic that provide a significant competitive advantage and have significant impact on pricing for Internet advertising and web traffic. The trend toward consolidation in the Internet advertising arena may also affect pricing and availability of advertising inventory and web traffic. Many of our current and potential competitors also enjoy other competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger client bases, greater access to advertising inventory on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we fail to deliver results that are superior to those that other online marketing service providers achieve, we could lose clients and our revenue may decline.
 If the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop, our future growth may be limited and our revenue may decrease.
 The online marketing services market is relatively new and rapidly evolving, and it uses different measurements than traditional media to gauge its effectiveness. Some of our current or potential clients have little or no experience using the Internet for advertising and marketing purposes and have allocated only limited portions of their advertising and marketing budgets to the Internet. The adoption of Internet advertising, particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising, requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging information and evaluating new advertising and marketing technologies and services. In particular, we are dependent on our clients adoption of new metrics to measure the success of online marketing campaigns. We may also experience resistance from traditional advertising agencies who may be advising our clients. We cannot assure you that the market for online marketing services will continue to grow. If the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, our ability to grow our business may be limited and our revenue may decrease.
 Third-party website publishers can engage in unauthorized or unlawful acts that could subject us to significant liability or cause us to lose clients.
 We generate a significant portion of our web visitors from media advertising that we purchase from third-party website publishers. Some of these publishers are authorized to display our clients brands, subject to contractual restrictions. In the past, some of our third-party website publishers have engaged in activities that certain of our clients have viewed as harmful to their brands, such as displaying outdated descriptions of a clients offerings or outdated logos. Any activity by publishers that clients view as potentially damaging to their brands can harm our relationship with the client and cause the client to terminate its relationship with us, resulting in a loss of revenue. In addition, the law is unsettled on the extent of liability that an advertiser in our position has for the activities of third-party website publishers. We could be subject to costly litigation and, if we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves, damages for the unauthorized or unlawful acts of third-party website publishers.
 Poor perception of our business or industry as a result of the actions of third parties could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our websites and providing leads and clicks to our clients, which depends in part on our reputation within the industry and with our clients. There are companies within our industry that regularly engage in activities that our clients customers may view as unlawful or inappropriate. These activities, such as spyware or deceptive promotions, by third parties may be seen by clients as characteristic of participants in our industry and, therefore, may have an adverse effect on the reputation of all participants in our industry, including us. Any damage to our reputation, including from publicity from legal proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry, governmental proceedings, consumer class action litigation, or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse, could adversely 
  - 10 -     affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Because many of our client contracts can be cancelled by the client with little prior notice or penalty, the cancellation of one or more contracts could result in an immediate decline in our revenue.
 We derive our revenue from contracts with our Internet marketing clients, most of which are cancelable with little or no prior notice. In addition, these contracts do not contain penalty provisions for cancellation before the end of the contract term. The non-renewal, renegotiation, cancellation, or deferral of large contracts, or a number of contracts that in the aggregate account for a significant amount of our revenue, is difficult to anticipate and could result in an immediate decline in our revenue.
 Unauthorized access to or accidental disclosure of consumer personally-identifiable information that we collect may cause us to incur significant expenses and may negatively impact our credibility and business.
 There is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding website visitors, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract website visitors and attract and retain our clients, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and thereby harm our business and operating results. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
 If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position and business may suffer.
 Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our proprietary systems and technology. We rely on trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, technical measures and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We currently have one patent application pending in the United States and no issued patents. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent protection may not be available in all countries where we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Some of our systems and technologies are not covered by any copyright, patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that: (i) our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us; (ii) our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties; (iii) our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak; (iv) any of the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or abandoned; (v) competitors will not design around our protected systems and technology; or (vi) that we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others.
 If we are unable to price our services appropriately, our margins and revenue may decline.
 Our clients purchase our services according to a variety of pricing formulae, the vast majority of which are based on pay for performance, meaning clients pay only after we have delivered the desired result to them. Regardless of how a given client pays us, we ordinarily pay the vast majority of the costs associated with delivering our services to our clients according to contracts and other arrangements that do not always condition payment to vendors upon receipt of payments from our clients. This means we typically pay for the costs of providing our marketing services before we receive payment from clients. Additionally, certain of our marketing services costs are highly variable and may fluctuate significantly during each calendar month. Accordingly, we run the risk of not being able to recover the entire cost of our services from clients if pricing or other terms negotiated prior to the performance of services prove less than the cost of performing such services. We have experienced situations in the past where we incurred losses in the delivery of our services to specific clients. If we are unable to avoid recurrence of similar situations in the future through negotiation of profitable pricing and other terms, our results of operations will suffer.
 Changes in government regulation and industry standards applicable to the Internet and our business could decrease demand for our technologies and services or increase our costs.
 Laws and regulations that apply to Internet communications, commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent. These regulations could increase the costs of conducting business on the Internet and could decrease demand for our technologies and services.
 In the United States, federal and state laws have been enacted regarding copyrights, sending of unsolicited commercial email, user privacy, search engines, Internet tracking technologies, direct marketing, data security, childrens privacy, pricing, sweepstakes, promotions, intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, export of encryption technology, taxation and acceptable content and quality of goods. Other laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Laws and regulations, including those related to privacy and use of 
  - 11 -     personal information, are changing rapidly outside the United States as well which may make compliance with such laws and regulations difficult and which may negatively affect our ability to expand internationally. This legislation could: (i) hinder growth in the use of the Internet generally; (ii) decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications, commercial and advertising medium; (iii) reduce our revenue; (iv) increase our operating expenses; or (v) expose us to significant liabilities.
 The laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. While we actively monitor this changing legal and regulatory landscape to stay abreast of changes in the laws and regulations applicable to our business, we are not certain how our business might be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, libel, obscenity and export or import matters to the Internet advertising industry. The vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the Internet market. It may take years to determine how existing laws apply to the Internet and Internet marketing. Such uncertainty makes it difficult to predict costs and could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs.
 Limitations on our ability to collect and use data derived from user activities could significantly diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose clients and revenue.
 When a user visits our websites, we use technologies, including cookies, to collect information such as the users Internet Protocol, or IP, address, offerings delivered by us that have been previously viewed by the user and responses by the user to those offerings. In order to determine the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and to determine how to modify the campaign, we need to access and analyze this information. The use of cookies has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny and users are able to block or delete cookies from their browser. Periodically, certain of our clients and publishers seek to prohibit or limit our collection or use of this data. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection systems, as well as privacy concerns regarding the collection of user data, could also limit our ability to analyze data from our clients marketing campaigns. This risk is heightened when we deliver marketing services to clients in the financial and medical services client verticals. If our access to data is limited in the future, we may be unable to provide effective technologies and services to clients and we may lose clients and revenue.
 As a creator and a distributor of Internet content, we face potential liability and expenses for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute. If we are required to pay damages or expenses in connection with these legal claims, our operating results and business may be harmed.
 We create original content for our websites and marketing messages and distribute third-party content on our websites and in our marketing messages. As a creator and distributor of original content and third-party provided content, we face potential liability based on a variety of theories, including defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or other legal theories based on the nature, creation or distribution of this information. It is also possible that our website visitors could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance upon information provided on our websites. In addition, as the number of users of forums and social media features on our websites increases, we could be exposed to liability in connection with material posted to our websites by users and other third parties. These claims, whether brought in the United States or abroad, could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merit of these claims. In addition, if we become subject to these types of claims and are not successful in our defense, we may be forced to pay substantial damages.
 We rely on Internet bandwidth and data center providers and other third parties for key aspects of the process of providing services to our clients, and any failure or interruption in the services and products provided by these third parties could harm our business.
 We rely on third-party vendors, including data center and Internet bandwidth providers. Any disruption in the network access or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict. We exercise little control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We license technology and related databases from third parties to facilitate analysis and storage of data and delivery of offerings. We have experienced interruptions and delays in service and availability for data centers, bandwidth and other technologies in the past. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and services could adversely affect our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties.
 Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our services, which could cause us to lose clients and harm our operating results.
 Our delivery of marketing and media services depends on the continuing operation of our technology 
  - 12 -     infrastructure and systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our ability to deliver offerings quickly and accurately and/or process visitors responses emanating from our various web presences. Interruptions in our service could reduce our revenue and profits, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, break-ins, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, and similar events.
 Any constraints on the capacity of our technology infrastructure could delay the effectiveness of our operations or result in system failures, which would result in the loss of clients and harm our business and results of operations.
 Our future success depends in part on the efficient performance of our software and technology infrastructure. As the numbers of websites and Internet users increase, our technology infrastructure may not be able to meet the increased demand. A sudden and unexpected increase in the volume of user responses could strain the capacity of our technology infrastructure. Any capacity constraints we experience could lead to slower response times or system failures and adversely affect the availability of websites and the level of user responses received, which could result in the loss of clients or revenue or harm to our business and results of operations.
 Limitations on director and officer liability and our indemnification of our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director.
 Our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide, as permitted by Nevada corporation law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws require indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law.
