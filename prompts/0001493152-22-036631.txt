Corporate History
 
Flywheel Advanced Technology, Inc. (formerly known as Pan Global Corp.) (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 30, 2010, under the name of Savvy Business Support, Inc. (“Savvy”). Savvy’s business was offering general business services/support to start-up companies, small and medium business planning to expand, individuals, and other business and organizations. Savvy was considered to be a shell company.
On April 25, 2013, Savvy entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (the “Pan Asia Exchange Agreement”) with Pan Asia Infratech Corp. a Nevada corporation (“Pan Asia”). Pan Asia was incorporated in Nevada on July 13, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the Pan Asia Exchange Agreement, consummated on April 26, 2013, the stockholders of Pan Asia transferred to Savvy 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Pan Asia (consisting of 15,000 shares of common stock, no par value) in exchange for, on a pro rata basis, an aggregate of 90,000,000 shares of Savvy’s common stock (the “Pan Asia Exchange”). As a result of the Pan Asia Exchange, Pan Asia became a wholly owned subsidiary of Savvy, and the business of Pan Asia became the business of the Company.
 
On April 26, 2013, Savvy amended its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada thereby changing its name from “Savvy Business Support, Inc.” to “Pan Global, Corp.” On May 2, 2013, the OTCQB symbol of the Company’s common stock was changed from SVYB to PGLO.

(“Sparta”), wherein Sparta purchased 10,000,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “A-1 Preferred Shares”) of Company. As a result, Sparta became an approximately 90% holder of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, on a fully diluted basis, and became the controlling shareholder. Sparta is controlled by Tang Siu Fung.
 
At the effective date of transfer, David Lazar ceased to be the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of as Directors, and the Company appointed:

● | Cheng Sin Yi as Secretary, and Treasurer; 
● | Tin Sze Wai as Director;

On November 21, 2021, the Board of Directors and majority shareholder approved the change of the Company’s name to “Flywheel Advanced Technology, Inc.”, and the change of the Company’s trading symbol became effective on August 3, 2022.
 
On November 22, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock on a 1:100 basis.
 
On July 13, 2022, the Company was advised by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) that the 1:100 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock would become effective on July 14, 2022. The 1:100 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock became effective on July 14, 2022.
 
Following the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, there are currently 1,551,550 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as compared to 155,155,000 shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding prior to the reverse stock split.

Pursuant to the Preferred Stock Amendment, the conversion rate of the Preferred Stock was changed to provide that each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1.62 fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company’s common stock.

Also on September 15, 2022, Sparta provided notice to the Company to convert all of the issued and outstanding Preferred Stock into 16,200,000 shares of common stock.

The shareholders have a preemptive right on any shares to be issued by Blue Print. The shareholders also agreed not to directly or indirectly sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or in any other way encumber their shares in Blue Print except with the prior written approval of all of the shareholders. Each shareholder was granted a right of first offer to purchase any shares in Blue Print that a shareholder desires to transfer.
 
Blue Print appointed Yiu Chung Ho as its sole director. Mr. Ho graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He has broad experience as a senior mechanical engineer in a wide range of areas, including making automotive components design, creating automatics processes, and designing facilities for mass production. He also acted as a director of Goldman Technology and had registered two lighting technology patents. Mr. Ho is fully responsible for the development and execution of Blue Print’s business plan.

Blue Print agrees to pay ISCA a 10% commission based on all delivered and invoiced direct orders, provided that a purchaser fulfilled all its obligations of the sales agreement to Blue Print.

We have also had discussions with other businesses that are interested in exploring a transaction with us and we will continue to pursue those and other opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing any acquisition.
 
Competition and Market Conditions
 
Until we successfully close the QBS transaction, or another transaction, we will continue to face substantial competition to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
