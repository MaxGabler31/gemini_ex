ITEM 1. Business.
Current Mission Statement
 
Our mission is to build shareholder value through new business development within the parent Company and by maximizing the potential of the Company’s movie theater holdings. The CEO and Board are presently evaluating new business and investment concepts which may allow FullCircle Registry to add another dimension to the Company in addition to its theater business.
History
 
Our initial business began in 2000 with the formation of FullCircle Registry, Inc (“FullCircle” or the “Company”). At that time, FullCircle was a technology-based business that provided emergency document and health record retrieval services.
 
The Company’s records retrieval technology was sound, but our marketing strategy targeted individuals as our potential customers, not health-based companies. As the records and documents retrieval business model emerged, competitors seized upon the opportunity to provide retrieval services to businesses. Because of these industry trends, the Company’s individual-based records retrieval solution became unmarketable.
 
The Company then initiated a series of new business models intended to provide value for the Company’s shareholders. Since 2008, the Company has created four subsidiaries to focus on additional business opportunities in the distribution of insurance agency, prescription assistance services, medical supplies, and movie theater entertainment.
 
FullCircle Entertainment, Inc.
 
The Company’s entertainment subsidiary, FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. (“FullCircle Entertainment”), was established in 2010 for acquiring movie theaters and other entertainment venues. On December 31, 2010, FullCircle Entertainment purchased Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located on eight acres at 3898 Lafayette Road, Indianapolis, IN 46254 for a purchase price of $5.5 million. Currently, the operation of this theater (and the lease of a grocery store within the structure) is the Company’s sole business and source of revenue.
Movie Theater Entertainment
 
The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive. Our theater competes against regional and independent operators as well as the larger theater circuit operators.
 
Our operations are subject to varying degrees of competition with respect to film licensing, attracting customers, and obtaining new theater sites. In those areas where real estate is readily available, there are few barriers preventing competing companies from opening theaters near our existing theater, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Demographic changes and competitive pressures can also lead to a theater location becoming impaired.
 
In addition to competition with other motion picture exhibitors, our theaters face competition from several alternative motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as cable television, satellite and pay-per-view services and home video systems. The expansion of such delivery systems could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. We also compete for the public’s leisure time and disposable income with all forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
 
The movie theater industry is dependent upon the timely release of first run movies. Ticket sales and concession sales are influenced by the availability of top producing movies. At times, our revenues are impacted by the shortage of first run movies. Through each year, we experience fewer hit film releases from the movie companies, especially between January through March and then again during the late summer between August and October. Generally, however, the theater is seeing periodic growth in ticket sales – again, tied directly to the strength and appeal of the films we schedule. 
    Company Operations
 
FullCircle Registry, Inc., and its subsidiaries have employee levels generally ranging between 18 and 28 employees/officers depending on seasonal needs. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and focus on good relations with our personnel and are continuing to attract stronger talent.

Theater Operations
 
Our General Manager is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations staff, including cash management and deposits, film scheduling, technical projection operations, employee scheduling and training, food and beverage inventory management, supply and repair vendor management, IT systems, security, and grounds keeping. The Company is currently analyzing changes to the organizational structure that will strengthen theater management.
 
In the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017, changes were made to the structure of theater management. The Company General Manager is represented by three Assistant General Managers, who report directly to the General Manager/CEO. Thus, the CEO has more control, visibility, and direct affect in the day to day operations. The CEO engages in movie booking process with booking agent and oversees and participates in all other duties of General Management.
 
Typically, movie studios release films with the highest expected revenues during the summer and the holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, causing seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Traditionally, our slow season is January through March, usually because of weather, and the period August through October.
 
We obtain licenses to exhibit films by using a booking agent to negotiate directly with film distributors. Prior to negotiating for a film license, the booking agent evaluates the prospects for upcoming films, applying criteria such as cast, director, plot, and performance of similar films, estimated film rental costs and expected revenues, as well as the demographics of our market area. Because we only license a portion of newly released first-run films, our success in licensing depends greatly upon the availability of commercially popular motion pictures, and the preferences of patrons in our market and insight into trends in those preferences. In 2016, we changed booking agents in order to improve access to first-run releases as well as to schedule Spanish language films.
 
Theater revenues come from the sale of movie tickets and concessions, as well as special events. Most of the tickets we sell are sold at our theater box offices immediately before the start of a film. Patrons can also buy tickets in advance on our website and Fandango. For the year ended December 31, 2017, box office admissions and concession sales were up marginally, but at a higher cost due to marketing expenditures during the first three quarters of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we cut unproductive marketing expenses.
 
Our theater business depends on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities. Movie theater attendance and concessions sales may be affected by any prolonged negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending. During these negative economic conditions, our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases because of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and other matters. This could result in a decrease in general consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to alternative forms of entertainment. Such factors could affect the demand for movies or severely impact the motion picture production industry, such that our business and operations could be adversely affected.
 
In the past, our concession stand was built around a limited menu, primarily focused on higher margin items such as popcorn, soft drinks, flavored popcorn, candy, frozen drinks, hot dogs and pretzels. In 2017 the Company implemented a new food service which was an upgrade of food choices in an effort to increase food sales as a percentage of total revenue. Concession inventory was purchased from a local supplier. The Company’s culinary chef also provided food supplies for the expanded menu. However, this effort in the first three quarters of 2017 resulted in loss of internal controls, and thus higher waste and food costs. 
 
Having subcontracted culinary chefs also severely compressed our concession profit margins and was cannibalizing our higher profit margin concession items. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw concession margins rebound as the change to in-house menu resumed. Plans for expanded in-house high margin items for 2018 are underway.
 
Marketing
 
The Georgetown 14 Digital Cinemas website is www.georgetowncinemas.com, which features up-to-date listings of all movie show times and the ability to pre-purchase tickets online. In October 2016, the theater purchased approximately 19,000 emails for African-American households and approximately 7,000 emails for Latino households within a 10-mile radius of the theater. Since that time, we have sent a weekly email in both English and Spanish with news on theater improvements, special promotions, movie trailer links and links to purchasing tickets on the website. The theater also has a Facebook page with 2,000 likes which is used for special event marketing. The Company is reviewing additional marketing plans focused on social media, including Short Text Messaging to mobile phones.
 
However, as stated earlier these costly efforts outweighed revenues. High cost internet marketing expenses were cut in favor of marketing to demographics for specific upcoming movies. These efforts saw the fourth quarter of 2017 marketing costs drop and attendance in varied demographics accelerate.

We believe that it is important to build patron loyalty through enhancing the benefits received by attending our theater. We are finalizing our loyalty program where members earn points based on admissions and concessions purchases. Upon achieving designated point thresholds, members are eligible for specified awards, such as reduced price admission tickets and discounts on concession items.
 
Implementing New Operational and Strategic Plans
 
At the close of 2017, the Company was prioritizing the implementation of several strategies:
 


New organizational structure to add senior staff positions as well as concession personnel. The theater has been running very lean during times of poor performance. The pace of increased ticket sales toward the end of 2017 has shown the need to add employees in order to assure quality of service. 
 

Increased presentation of films from India as well as Spanish language versions of popular Hollywood films. Offering multi-language films and hosting multi-cultural events to target the local demographic is a key part of our future strategy. 
 
In the fourth quarter, we marketed directly to local conventions, schools, daycare centers, churches & senior living facilities, targeting them with specific upcoming movies. We removed those marketing ventures that did not prove profitable and began to streamline procedures. In 2018, we plan to increase revenue per head by:
 


Increasing concession prices to cover sales tax on those items, which is standard in the industry 
 

Competitively pricing tickets and concession items with the local Indianapolis metropolitan area 
 

Upgrading our inventory process by integrating it into the current POS to make inventory 
 

Increase safety and security by adding cameras, video screens, and security guards during peak times. 
 
Present Sources of Funding 
 
Previously, when FullCircle Entertainment experienced revenue shortfalls, the Company’s issued stock to pay certain vendors for services in lieu of cash payments. Management has determined that using stock in lieu of cash for vendor services is a practice which needlessly dilutes current shareholder interests. 
 
Instead, management sought other sources of funding. Initially, the funding burden fell solely on the Company’s founders and Board members, who provided funding in the form of loans represented by promissory notes. The Board has also assisted in presenting FullCircle Entertainment’s “Round One” investment proposal to individual promissory note investors, principally from Kentucky where the Company is headquartered. These promissory note investors receive 6.25% to 15% interest, compounded annually with interest to be paid quarterly. Payment of the interest on these promissory notes is a line item in FullCircle Entertainment’s budget, which is prioritized to provide timely interest payments to our investors. During the year ended December 31, 2017, FullCircle Entertainment received $497,000 in funding promissory notes and advances from our shareholders and founders and $122,000 from other individual investors located in Kentucky.
 
Future Sources of Funding
 
The Company plans to use anticipated increased rising theater profits to both supplement planned improvements and to ensure that we meet our payment obligations to our note holders.
 
FullCircle Entertainment is now preparing an updated investment proposal for additional individual promissory note investors.
 
In the future, the Company may also consider sales of Company stock if the market value of the Company’s shares supports this strategy.
 
At this time, we have no contracts, agreements, or understandings for additional funding, nor can any assurance be given that we will be able to obtain this capital on acceptable terms. In such an event, this may have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Mortgage Debt Payment Reduction
 
In late 2016, the Company, began negotiations with Kirkland Financial, holder of the real estate mortgage and the equipment note to combine the property mortgage and the equipment note into a more affordable single monthly payment. Prior to the end of December, Kirkland Financial responded with a restructured finance agreement which reduced the combined property and equipment note monthly payment from $46,094 to $15,223. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s new capital commitments on the combined property and equipment loan to FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. are $4,546,390. As a result of this loan modification, the Company recorded a $114,821 gain on forgiveness of prior accrued interest associated with the former mortgage and equipment note. The new mortgage has a balloon payment of all unpaid principal and interest on July 15, 2020. Finally, after the theater is again cash flowing to expectations, the Company plans to refinance the mortgage to maintain an acceptable monthly payment.
Other Debt
 
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $165,000 in unsecured notes payable, $149,000 of unsecured advances from a related party and $1,557,938 of unsecured notes payable from related parties. Most unsecured notes and advances are with shareholders of the Company and does not require any debt maintenance now, as interest is accrued.
 
We have a combined property mortgage and equipment note of approximately $4,546,400 which is secured as of December 31, 2017. We also have a note payable to a financial institution associated with a vehicle in the amount of $6,979 as of December 31, 2017. 
 
Our amount of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:
 


increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; 
 

require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our mortgage indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; 
 

increase our cost of borrowing; 
 

restrict us from making strategic acquisitions; 
 

limit our ability to service our indebtedness; 
 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate purposes; 
 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less highly leveraged competitors who may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting. 
 
Property Taxes
 
Over the past two years, the Company successfully appealed the assessed taxable value of the Company’s real and personal property. However, limited cash flows led to failure to make timely payments of the Company’s real and personal property taxes owed. New management arranged a monthly payment plan with the Marion County Tax Assessor to bring past tax payments current. The remaining portion of the delinquent property tax payments were paid in full during the year ended December 31, 2017.
