--------+---------

Introduction 
 We are one of the leading designers, manufacturers and marketers of railroad freight car equipment in North America, Europe and South America. We manufacture railcars in Brazil through a strategic investment that we account for under the equity method of accounting and are a manufacturer and marketer of marine barges in North America. We are a leading provider of freight railcar wheel services, parts, repair and refurbishment in North America through our wheels, repair & parts business. We also offer railcar management, regulatory compliance services and leasing services to railroads and related transportation industries in North America. Through unconsolidated affiliates, we produce industrial and rail castings, tank heads and other components. 
 We operate an integrated business model in North America that combines freight car manufacturing, wheel services, repair, refurbishment, component parts, leasing and fleet management services. Our model is designed to provide customers with a comprehensive set of freight car solutions utilizing our substantial engineering, mechanical and technical capabilities as well as our experienced commercial personnel. This model allows us to develop cross-selling opportunities and synergies among our various business segments and to enhance our margins. We believe our integrated model is difficult to duplicate and provides greater value for our customers. 
 We operate in three reportable segments: Manufacturing; Wheels, Repair & Parts; and Leasing & Services. Financial information about our business segments as well as geographic information is located in Note 19 Segment Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to August 20, 2018, we operated in four reportable segments: Manufacturing; Wheels & Parts; Leasing & Services; and GBW Joint Venture. On August 20, 2018 we entered into an agreement with our joint venture partner to discontinue the GBW Railcar Services (GBW) railcar repair joint venture, which resulted in 12 repair shops returned to us. Beginning on August 20, 2018, GBW Joint Venture was no longer considered a reportable segment. 
 The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., is incorporated in Oregon. Our principal executive offices are located at One Centerpointe Drive, Suite 200, Lake Oswego, Oregon 97035, our telephone number is (503) 684-7000 and our Internet website is located at http://www.gbrx.com. 
 Products and Services 
 Manufacturing Segment 
 North American Railcar Manufacturing - We manufacture a broad array of railcar types in North America, which includes most railcar types other than coal cars. We have demonstrated an ability to capture high market shares in many of the car types we produce. The primary products we produce for the North American market are: 
 Intermodal Railcars - We manufacture a comprehensive range of intermodal railcars. Our most important intermodal product is our articulated double-stack railcar. The double-stack railcar is designed to transport containers stacked two-high on a single platform and provides significant operating and capital savings over other types of intermodal railcars. 
 Tank Cars - We produce a variety of tank cars, including both general and certain pressurized tank cars, which are designed for the transportation of products such as petroleum products, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, caustic soda, chlorine, urea ammonium nitrate, vegetable oils, bio-diesel and various other products and we continue to expand our product offerings. 
 Automotive - We manufacture a full line of railcar equipment specifically designed for the transportation of light vehicles. Our automotive offerings include the Auto-Max II and Multi-Max products, which are designed to carry automobiles, SUVs and trucks efficiently.

 Conventional Railcars - We produce a variety of covered hopper cars for the grain, fertilizer, sand, cement and petrochemical industries as well as gondolas and open top hoppers for the steel, metals and aggregate markets. We also produce a wide range of boxcars, which are used in the transport of paper products, perishables, general merchandise and commodities. Our flat car products include center partition cars for the forest products industry, bulkhead flat cars, heavy-duty flat cars, and solid waste service flat cars. 
 European Railcar Manufacturing - Our European manufacturing operations produce a variety of tank, automotive and conventional freight railcar (wagon) types, including a comprehensive line of pressurized tank cars for liquid petroleum gas and ammonia and non-pressurized tank cars for light oil, chemicals and other products. In addition, we produce flat cars, coil cars for the steel and metals market, gondolas, sliding wall cars and automobile transporter cars. 
 Marine Vessel Fabrication - Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility, located on a deep-water port on the Willamette River, includes marine vessel fabrication capabilities. The marine facilities also increase utilization of steel plate burning and fabrication capacity providing flexibility for railcar production. U.S. coastwise law, commonly referred to as the Jones Act, requires all commercial vessels transporting merchandise between ports in the U.S. to be built, owned, operated and manned by U.S. citizens and to be registered under the U.S. flag. We manufacture a broad range of Jones Act ocean-going and river barges for transporting merchandise between ports within the U.S. including conventional deck barges, double-hull tank barges, railcar/deck barges, barges for aggregates and other heavy industrial products and dump barges. Our primary focus is on the larger ocean-going vessels although the facility has the capability to compete in other marine-related products. 
Wheels, Repair & Parts Segment 
 Wheel Services - We operate a large wheel services network in North America. Our wheel shops, operating in eight locations, provide complete wheel services including reconditioning of wheels and axles in addition to new axle machining and finishing and axle downsizing. 
 Railcar Repair, Refurbishment and Maintenance - We operate a railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance network in North America including repair shops certified by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Our repairs shops, operating at 12 locations, perform heavy railcar repair, refurbishment and routine railcar maintenance for third parties and our leased and managed railcar fleet. 
 Component Parts Manufacturing - Our component parts facilities, operating in four locations, recondition and manufacture railcar cushioning units, couplers, yokes, side frames, bolsters and various other parts. We also produce roofs, doors and associated parts for boxcars. 
Leasing & Services Segment 
 Leasing - Through our North American leasing business, our relationships with financial institutions, combined with our ownership of a lease fleet of approximately 8,100 railcars (6,300 railcars held as equipment on operating leases, 1,600 held as leased railcars for syndication and 200 held as finished goods inventory), enables us to offer flexible financing programs including operating leases and by the mile leases to our customers. In addition, we frequently originate leases of railcars, which are either newly built or refurbished by us, or buy railcars from the secondary market, and sell the railcars and attached leases to financial institutions and subsequently provide such institutions with management services under multi-year agreements. As an equipment owner and an originator of leases, we participate principally in the operating lease segment of the market. The majority of our leases are full service leases whereby we are responsible for maintenance and administration. Assets from our owned lease fleet are periodically sold to take advantage of market conditions, manage risk and maintain liquidity. 
 Management Services - Our North American management services business offers a broad array of software and services that include railcar maintenance management, railcar accounting services (such as billing and revenue collection, car hire receivable and payable administration), total fleet management (including railcar tracking using proprietary software), administration and railcar re-marketing. We currently provide management services

 Our total manufacturing backlog of railcar units as of August 31, 2018 was approximately 27,400 units with an estimated value of $2.74 billion, of which 21,200 units are for direct sales and 6,200 units are for lease to third parties. Approximately 3% of backlog units and 2% of the estimated value as of August 31, 2018 was associated with our Brazilian manufacturing operations which is accounted for under the equity method. 
 

6 | The Greenbrier Companies 2018 Annual Report



 Based on current production schedules, approximately 20,500 units in the August 31, 2018 backlog are scheduled for delivery in 2019. The balance of the production is scheduled for delivery in 2020 and beyond. Multi-year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice. Backlog units for lease may be syndicated to third parties or held in our own fleet depending on a variety of factors. A portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix. Under terms of the orders, the exact mix and pricing will be determined in the future, which may impact the dollar amount of backlog. Marine backlog as of August 31, 2018 was $61 million compared to $42 million as of August 31, 2017. 
 Our backlog of railcar units and marine vessels is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Certain orders in backlog are subject to customary documentation and completion of terms. Customers may attempt to cancel or modify orders in backlog. Historically, little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered, though the timing of deliveries may be modified from time to time. We cannot guarantee that our reported backlog will convert to revenue in any particular period, if at all. 
 Customers 
 Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, financial institutions, shippers, carriers and transportation companies. We have strong, long-term relationships with many of our customers. We believe that our customers preference for high quality products, our technological leadership in developing innovative products and competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers. 
 In 2018, revenue from two customers, TTX Company (TTX) and Wells Fargo & Company (Wells Fargo), accounted for approximately 31% of total revenue, 36% of Manufacturing revenue, 16% of Wheels, Repair & Parts revenue and 1% of Leasing & Services revenue. No other customers accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue. 
 Raw Materials and Components 
 Our products require a supply of materials including steel and specialty components such as brakes, wheels and axles. Specialty components purchased from third parties represent a significant amount of the cost of most freight cars. Our customers often specify particular components and suppliers of such components. Although the number of alternative suppliers of certain specialty components has declined in recent years, there are at least two available suppliers for these components. 
 Certain materials and components are periodically in short supply which could potentially impact production at our new railcar and refurbishment facilities. In an effort to mitigate shortages and reduce supply chain costs, we have entered into strategic alliances and multi-year arrangements for the global sourcing of certain materials and components, we operate a replacement parts business and we continue to pursue strategic opportunities to protect and enhance our supply chain. We periodically make advance purchases to avoid possible shortages of material due to capacity limitations of component suppliers, shipping and transportation delays and possible price increases. 
 In 2018, the top ten suppliers for all inventory purchases accounted for approximately 52% of total purchases. Amsted Rail Company, Inc. accounted for 19% of total inventory purchases in 2018. No other suppliers accounted for more than 10% of total inventory purchases. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers. 
 Competition 
 We are currently the second largest railcar manufacturer in North America of the seven major railcar manufacturers competing in North America. There are a handful of specialty builders who focus on niche markets. We believe that in Europe we are in the top tier of railcar manufacturers. European freight car manufacturers are largely located in central and eastern Europe where labor rates are lower and work rules are more flexible. We are the leading railcar manufacturer in South America. The railcar manufacturing industry is becoming more global as customers are purchasing railcars from manufacturers outside of their geographic region. In all railcar markets that we serve or participate in, we compete on the basis of quality, price, reliability of delivery, product design and innovation, reputation and customer service and support. 

The Greenbrier Companies 2018 Annual Report | 7



 Competition in the marine industry is dependent on the type of product produced. There are few competitors that build product types similar to ours. We compete on the basis of price, quality, reliability of delivery, launching capacity and experience with certain product types. 
 Competition in the wheels, repair & parts businesses is dependent on the type of product or service provided. There are many competitors in the railcar repair and refurbishment business and an increasing number of competitors in the wheel services and other parts businesses. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, timeliness of delivery, customer service, location of shops, price and engineering expertise. 
 There are at least twenty institutions in North America that provide railcar leasing and services similar to ours. Many of them are also customers that buy new railcars from our manufacturing facilities and used railcars from our lease fleet, as well as utilize our management services. Many of these institutions have greater financial resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, price, delivery, reputation, service offerings and deal structuring and syndication ability. We believe our strong servicing capability and our ability to sell railcars with a lease attached (syndicate railcars), integrated with our manufacturing, repair shops, railcar specialization and expertise in particular lease structures provide a strong competitive position. 
 Marketing and Product Development 
 In North America, we leverage an integrated marketing and sales effort to coordinate relationships in our various segments. We provide our customers with a diverse range of equipment and financing alternatives designed to satisfy each customers unique needs, whether the customer is buying new equipment, refurbishing existing equipment or seeking to outsource the maintenance or management of equipment. These custom programs may involve a combination of railcar products, leasing, refurbishing and remarketing services. In addition, we provide customized maintenance management, equipment management, accounting and compliance services and proprietary software solutions. 
 In Europe and South America, we maintain relationships with customers through market-specific sales personnel. Our engineering and technical staff works closely with their customer counterparts on the design and certification of railcars. Many European railroads are state-owned and are subject to European Union (EU) regulations covering the tender of government contracts. 
 Through our research and customer relationships, insights are derived into the potential need for new products and services. Marketing and engineering personnel collaborate to evaluate opportunities and develop new products and features. Recent product launches include the Dura-Max open top hopper and small pressurized tank cars optimized for the transport of chlorine. Research and development costs incurred during the years ended August 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $6.0 million, $4.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively. 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 We have a number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents of varying duration, and pending patent applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names that are important to our products and product development efforts. The protection of our intellectual property is important to our business and we have a proactive program aimed at protecting our intellectual property and the results from our research and development. 
Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions, wastewater discharge, solid and hazardous waste disposal and employee health and safety. Prior to acquiring facilities, we usually conduct investigations to evaluate the environmental condition of subject properties and may negotiate contractual terms for allocation of environmental exposure arising from prior uses. We operate our facilities in a manner designed to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental studies have been conducted on certain of our owned and leased properties that indicate additional investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be necessary.

Portland Harbor Superfund Site 
 Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. In December 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified portions of the Willamette River bed known as the Portland Harbor, including the portion fronting our manufacturing facility, as a federal National Priority List or Superfund site due to sediment contamination (the Portland Harbor Site). Our company and more than 140 other parties have received a General Notice of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised us that we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation (which liability may be joint and several with other potentially responsible parties) as well as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. Ten private and public entities, including us (the Lower Willamette Group or LWG), signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) of the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several additional entities have not signed such consent, but nevertheless contributed money to the effort. The EPA-mandated RI/FS was produced by the LWG and cost over $110 million during a 17-year period. We bore a percentage of the total costs incurred by the LWG in connection with the investigation. Our aggregate expenditure during the 17-year period was not material. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. The EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) for the Portland Harbor Site on January 6, 2017 and accordingly on October 26, 2017, the AOC was terminated. 
 Separate from the process described above, which focused on the type of remediation to be performed at the Portland Harbor Site and the schedule for such remediation, 83 parties, including the State of Oregon and the federal government, entered into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs associated with remediation of the Portland Harbor site. Approximately 110 additional parties signed tolling agreements related to such allocations. On April 23, 2009, we and the other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema Inc. et al v. A & C Foundry Products, Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Case #3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice, and the case has been stayed by the court until January 16, 2020. The allocation process is continuing in parallel with the process to define the remediation steps. 
 The EPAs January 6, 2017 ROD identifies a clean-up remedy that the EPA estimates will take 13 years of active remediation, followed by 30 years of monitoring with an estimated undiscounted cost of $1.7 billion. The EPA typically expects its cost estimates to be accurate within a range of -30% to +50%, but this ROD states that changes in costs are likely to occur as a result of new data it wants to collect over a 2-year period prior to final remedy design. The ROD identifies 13 Sediment Decision Units. One of the units, RM9W, includes the nearshore area of the river sediments offshore of our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility as well as upstream and downstream of the facility. It also includes a portion of our riverbank. The ROD does not break down total remediation costs by Sediment Decision Unit. The EPAs ROD concluded that more data was needed to better define clean-up scope and cost. On December 8, 2017, the EPA announced that Portland Harbor is one of 21 Superfund sites targeted for greater attention. On December 19, 2017, the EPA announced that it had entered a new AOC with a group of four potentially responsible parties to conduct additional sampling during 2018 and 2019 to provide more certainty about clean-up costs and aid the mediation process to allocate those costs. The parties to the mediation, including us, have agreed to help fund the additional sampling. 
 The ROD does not address responsibility for the costs of clean-up, nor does it allocate such costs among the potentially responsible parties. Responsibility for funding and implementing the EPAs selected cleanup remedy will be determined at an unspecified later date. Based on the investigation to date, we believe that we did not contribute in any material way to contamination in the river sediments or the damage of natural resources in the Portland Harbor Site and that the damage in the area of the Portland Harbor Site adjacent to our property precedes our ownership of the Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility. Because these environmental investigations are still underway, including the collection of new pre-remedial design sampling data by EPA, sufficient information is currently not available to determine our liability, if any, for the cost of any required remediation or restoration of the Portland Harbor Site or to estimate a range of potential loss. Based on the results of the pending investigations and future assessments of natural resource damages, we may be required to incur costs associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, we may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging in order to continue 
 

The Greenbrier Companies 2018 Annual Report | 9



  to launch vessels from our launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River, and the rivers classification as a Superfund site could result in some limitations on future dredging and launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business and Consolidated Financial Statements, or the value of our Portland property. 
 On January 30, 2017 the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation sued 33 parties including us as well as the United States and the State of Oregon for costs it incurred in assessing alleged natural resource damages to the Columbia River from contaminants deposited in Portland Harbor. Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation v. Air Liquide America Corp., et al., United States Court for the District of Oregon Case No. 3i17-CV-00164-SB. We, along with many of the other defendants, moved to dismiss the case. That motion is pending. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages the Plaintiff will seek. 
 Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Regulation of Portland Manufacturing Operations 
 We have entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with the DEQ in which we agreed to conduct an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present operations at our Portland property may have released hazardous substances into the environment. We have also signed an Order on Consent with the DEQ to finalize the investigation of potential onsite sources of contamination that may have a release pathway to the Willamette River. Interim precautionary measures are also required in the order and we are discussing with the DEQ potential remedial actions which may be required. Our aggregate expenditure has not been material, however we could incur significant expenses for remediation. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. 
Regulation 
 We must comply with the rules of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the administrative agencies it oversees including the Federal Railroad Administration in the U.S. and Transport Canada in Canada who administer and enforce laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety appliance standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate and international commerce throughout North America. The AAR promulgates rules and regulations governing the safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads and other railcar owners with respect to railcars in interchange, and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on North American railroads. These regulations require maintaining certifications with the AAR as a railcar builder, repair and service provider and component manufacturer, and products sold and leased by us in North America must meet AAR, Transport Canada, and Federal Railroad Administration standards. 
 The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the ocean-going barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration of the USDOT, and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. 
 The regulatory environment in Europe consists of a combination of EU regulations and country specific regulations, including a harmonized set of Technical Standards for Interoperability of freight wagons throughout the EU. The regulatory environment in Brazil consists of oversight from the Ministry of Transportation, the National Agency of Ground Transportation and the National Association of Railroad Transporters. In all other countries, we conform to country specific regulations where applicable. 
 Employees 
 As of August 31, 2018, we had approximately 13,400 full-time employees at our consolidated entities, consisting of 12,100 employees in Manufacturing, 1,000 in Wheels, Repair & Parts and 300 employees in Leasing & Services and corporate. In Manufacturing, 7,300 employees, all of whom are located in Mexico and Europe, are represented by unions. At our Wheels, Repair & Parts locations, 73 employees are represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
