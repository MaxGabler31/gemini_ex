 Overview
 Our mission is to software-enable the entire physical world.  
 Our RFID (radio-frequency identification) devices are designed to digitally enable and secure any physical item. Our products enable frictionless digital interaction with the physical world, manage data flows from each physical object, creating a software-enabled experience that is far beyond a purely physical interaction.
 By digitally enabling physical 'things,' we make them more secure, responsive, feature-rich, interactive and customer-connected. RFID powers a wide range of applications from customer engagement, product authenticity, enhanced consumer experiences, instrumentation and sensor enabling, brand protection, tamper detection, and other IoT applications. We add frictionless customer engagement, managing the interaction of products with mobile devices to create totally new experiences.  
 Our strategy is to digitally enable the world at the smallest and largest scales. As each grows and becomes pervasive their interactions and network effects create exponentially greater value.
 We execute our strategy of digitally enabling the smallest-scale things and largest-scale things by focusing in two segments:  our Identity business and our Premises business.

• | Identity: Our Identity business is focused on digitally enabling and securing every physical thing. Our designs and products include embedded RFID solutions to make digital and physical devices more responsive, secure, feature-rich, interactive and customer-connected. Our RFID devices have been integrated into and have digitally-enabled over a billion and a half physical internet of things around the world. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Premises: Our Premises business is focused on digitally enabling and securing every physical place. We apply much the same RFID and security technology from our Identity segment to our physical and logical security platforms to create what we believe is a more secure, convenient and responsive experience in physical spaces. Our platform is deployed across buildings worldwide, ranging from sensitive government facilities, schools, utilities, hospitals, stores, and apartment buildings, to the smallest shops worldwide.

Identity Strategy
 Market Drivers
 The emerging market of RFID is driven by pervasive use cases. For example, RFID enables syringes to track whether the exact right amount of medication is filled into them and dispensed into the patient. Refrigerators can tell when the filter needs to be replaced, and make sure an authentic replacement is installed and working. Running shoes can sense how many steps you’ve taken. Phone accessories can work together intelligently with your phone to create novel experiences and applications. Governments can track the quality and authenticity of cannabis products for compliance and especially for tax collection. Temperature-sensitive medicine can be tracked to ensure it has stayed within its safety parameters and not spoiled. Bicycle and scooter tire pressure and frame wear can be monitored. Consumer and luxury goods can be authenticated, personalized and responsive. Vaping pods can be verified and tamper resistant for safety and authenticity. Blood test assays can be verified as authentic and matched with the right blood sample.
 These examples demonstrate the scale of the market opportunity of hundreds of billions of units over time. We believe competitive pressures will drive adoption across each sector as technology improves and costs drop, until nearly every physical thing has a sensor-augmented, integrated, digital existence.  
 
We share the vision with leading chip makers that every physical thing on the planet will have a digital existence. Tiny, low-cost RFID chips with highly tuned and optimized antennas, systems, software and security that are embedded in everything we interact with. This is software reaching every physical thing on the planet, and Identiv enables it.

Competitive Advantages
 We believe our core differentiation is our best-in-class designs, technologies and intellectual property to enable the secure digital capabilities of RFID chips to work in the analog world of antennas, power harvesting, data conversion and security. They have to go on a shoe, in a syringe, embedded in the hair of a doll, then they have to communicate through RF (radio frequency), and harvest power from the radio signal of the phone or reader, to run the chip. They have to do this reliably, while the item is dropped, washed, stuffed in pockets and generally exposed to the real world. We design the systems, the antennas, software, security and physical form that connects the chips, accesses their capabilities, manages RF communications and power conversion, and creates the platform for the digital experience, all in harmony with the physical experience of the product. 
 
 
• | Imagine, Design, Prototype
--+---------------------------

 We make this happen with our library of designs, with patents like tag-on-metal and with IP we’ve developed working with advanced early adopters in their industries. We believe we deepen our value and competitive advantage by providing both the devices themselves in high volume as well as the readers and programmers to personalize and read the RFID devices. Whether it’s in a pharmacy or any other place where RFID is read or programmed, our readers are among the most widely deployed for NFC (near-field communication) and high-frequency RFID programming and reading. We believe this gives us both credibility with our customers' engineers and the flexibility to add software value that providers of just RFID devices can’t.  
 We then work closely with our customers' engineers to build the complicated analog bridge and system to make it all work across RF. With very high reliability, high data security and optimized power transfer, the end user gets an engaged interaction.   
 
 
• | Pilot, Scale-up, Re-Imagine, Re-Design....Repeat
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Then because we own our own world class production facilities, we go directly to prototypes, pilot runs, ramp up production and deliver with high quality even for the most complicated devices. What usually happens next is the customers' engineers want to improve the product, either from what they’ve learned or because our chip partners come out with new chips, new features, new price points. We would then typically run another rapid cycle of re-design / re-prototype / re-pilot / re-production processes.  
 We believe that in this market of thousands of designs and hundreds of billions of units there are substantial first-mover advantages. We believe our design through production platform keeps customers with us as they drive more capabilities and better performance into their customer experiences. We believe this will accelerate, driven by the chips Moore's Law speed advances, and by competitive forces created when any digitally enabled product is launched, pressuring others to keep up or lose the market opportunity. 
 
Growth Strategy
 Our strategy to deliver on our mission is focused on pervasive deployment of high-end, sensor-enabled RFID devices in every physical thing and every physical place. We believe the category of the most sophisticated products is where we’re the strongest. With over 150 active RFID customers, we’re engaged with some of the most advanced early adopters, built on our reputation as the go-to partner for advanced RFID devices. We believe there are three growth drivers in RFID: customer launches, design wins and technology expansion.  
Customer Launch & Use Case Examples
 
 
• | Pharmaceutical prescriptions: Our RFID devices attached to prescription pill bottles enable an app to speak the contents, dosage, and regimen for the visually impaired. Our programmers are used by pharmacists to securely personalize the prescription for each customer. We believe this has the potential to expand to all prescriptions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Mobile accessories: With the power of mobile phones, we believe accessories that are unconnected are a missed opportunity. When your phone case, wallet, glucose monitor and other accessories can talk directly to your phone, they become part of the mobile platform. Our RFID devices embedded in mobile phone accessories enable rich, extensible experiences on a mobile device with an RFID-enabled accessory.
 
 
• | Medical consumables: It’s critical that a part like a disposable breathing tube is authentic to go with a particular manufacturer's ventilator. Our RFID devices enable a customer's product to track authenticity and usage of breathing tubes for ventilators. We believe every medical device consumable should be RFID enabled to make sure the right part is used with the right machine, and to make sure it’s used only as intended, and replaced with a genuine part, creating a high-value, quality-sensitive, recurring, consumables-based use category.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are just a few examples of use cases already in-market and growing, that we believe will expand to touch physical interaction with nearly every physical thing.
 
Design wins
 Design wins are the key to our leadership in the market as it expands. We believe our technical expertise, leadership, IP, active customer engagements and reputation across all facets of RFID provide a pipeline of design win opportunities. Specific recent examples include:
 
 
• | Industrial and Adverse Consumer RFID Applications (Industrial Assets, Bikes, Scooters): Our patented tag-on-metal RFID devices for authenticity, tracking and customer engagement are early-adoption uses we’re designing for companies in this category. These specialty applications are demanded and required for various use cases within adverse environments. We’re also working on tag-on-metal designs to track tire pressure, permitting a phone-tap to the wheel to display pressure instead of awkwardly jamming a pressure gauge on a tube stem. Strain gauge enabled RFID devices to track wear-and-tear are in early stages. This cycle of immediate-benefit, low-risk applications, followed by second-generation more complicated applications and then planning ahead for later-generation, experience-changing applications we believe is the proliferation path many leading companies will follow to deploy the full range of capabilities of a digitally-enabled RFID-connected product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid blood analyzing systems: This application goes onto consumable cartridges to calibrate the system and confirm authenticity and content for the blood test assay. This use case is applicable to most testing and assays where authenticity, data integrity, reliability and seamless integration with existing form factors are critical.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Existing customer design expansion: Core to our strategy is continuously improving designs, to leverage new chip features, capabilities, price and performance. With one of our major customers within the Healthcare segment, we completed a complex design in their initial product cycle; and we’ve since developed three additional designs built from the original, with at least two of them selected into a new launch phase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Technology expansion
 Our ability to get more design wins and successful customer launches depends on our best-in-class engineering and production, but upstream of that it’s built on new technologies we’re constantly incorporating and designing as new capabilities for our customers.  
  
• | Passive temperature sensors and patches: Provide the ability to track the temperature of people or things, without having a battery attached, flexibly attached on skin or integrated with other products, wherever temperature is critical to track. Perpetually-functioning (no battery), usable almost anywhere (small, custom-designable, flexible) at a fraction of the cost of powered cold-chain trackers opens multiple use cases within the IoT that were impractical or price-prohibitive.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrated strain gauges: Designs with integrated strain gauges to track the bending and strain of objects, whether
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 they’re made of metal, plastic or even concrete. Early use cases range from tracking bending and long-term wear in bridges, using hundreds of embedded sensors, to tracking the pounding and wear on mountain bike frames and other load-bearing consumer products.  
 
 
• | Capacitive fluid sensors: This senses fluid fill even through glass or other materials, so you can track medicine fills
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 in syringes, serum bottles, and anything else. For certainty of fluid fill and dispensing, medical and high value/high-sensitivity fluid measurement use cases are easily enabled at scale. Combined with a one-time counter, counterfeit re-fills can be precluded by the same device while providing transparency for compliance to insurers and other regulatory agencies.
 
 
• | Multi-frequency devices: Combination RFID devices integrating both UHF (ultra-high frequency) and HF (high frequency) in a single device bring UHF's long read-range to the rich feature set – but limited read-range - of NFC and other HF RFID devices. We have focused on a solution for the Cannabis industry that we believe best serves requirements around supply chain transparency, tamper protection, authenticity and consumer experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New RFID chips: We continuously collaborate with RFID chip suppliers as well as specialty chip manufacturers to steer them in the direction of innovation with our active customer requirements. We develop integrated designs to deliver the price and features of the newest chips for easy adoption into new products and better scale with active and prospective customers.

Premises Strategy
 Just as our RFID products’ software enables things on the planet, our Premises platform software enables places on the planet. Our platform is anchored by our Velocity and Freedom software, our line of controllers and IoT gateways including Mx, our Freedom SmartBridge, our TouchSecure access sensors, our Velocity Vision video platform and a wide range of integrations. 
 
Also identical to our RFID strategy, we believe our Premises competitive advantage is our technical depth and total solution. In Premises our platform encompasses the total digitization of physical places, incorporating our own access sensors, gateways, bridges, appliances, cards, access and video software, integrations and analytics.    
  
• | Premises Software: Our software platform for premises digitization enables centralized management of a physical
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 place, including control of doors, cameras, gates, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a continuous audit trail. Our platforms are IT-centric and highly scalable from small businesses through global organizations, multi-tenant, special-purpose campuses such as schools, military bases, utilities and others. Our platforms are available as local software or cloud based, accessible through browser, mobile and desktop interfaces. We leverage data infrastructures across LAN's, Wifi, Bluetooth, mobile, RFID and emerging communication standards such as 5G and UWB (ultra wide-band). As communications infrastructure becomes fully wireless, low-power and high-security, our software is architected to support seamless migration to fully software-defined systems, compatible with pervasive RFID devices to enable a frictionless, convenient and secure experience in almost any physical location.   
  
• | Access Readers & Sensors: As most of the physical infrastructure becomes wireless, virtual and software-defined,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 the remaining device will be the sensors at the door. As platforms for local presence confirmation, video and audio interaction, and to signal a door to open, we believe our family of TouchSecure (TS) sensors will continue to play a key physical role in providing security and convenience at the door. 
 Sales & Marketing Strategy
 Our go-to-market strategy is consistent across our business. We believe our competitive advantage is our technical expertise, technology and know-how which covers both the user side and the programmer/reader/infrastructure side.  With this depth of technology across the overall system we develop and prove our best-in-class use cases with our customers.  

• | Use-case Proliferation: We apply our digital marketing platforms, sales teams and channel partners to proliferate each use case as best-in-class. We target the product engineers or other decision makers to build awareness of a proven solution. We drive our marketing message in terms that engineers value because we’ve established the benefits from comparable use cases. As a company adopts RFID and delivers superior product experiences, we believe that drives faster adoption by others, until a use-case becomes pervasive.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trusted advisor: Reducing adoption cost and risk: We have built a reputation as the trusted advisor to our customers by sharing benefits and pitfalls, risks and tradeoffs, as well as ways to mitigate them. We also communicate the risk of inaction, as others come to market with new capabilities. By highlighting risks of inaction, making customers aware of upcoming competitive threats and sharing insights into how they can confidently build competitive capabilities themselves, we believe we become their trusted advisor early in their learning and decision cycle. Then, because we help with the designs, provide devices as well as reader/programmers, and complete solutions or best-of-breed components, we often become a long-term partner, reducing their risks and efforts and improving their competitive advantages.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Confidentiality and Trust: Throughout this process confidentiality is paramount. A capability developed uniquely with and for a customer is not shared with another. That is fundamental to our culture and to our business practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industry Leader and Facilitator: As we develop general use-case capabilities and insights, we share and leverage those cross-industry, adding value and building our competitive advantage. Specific differentiation established with a customer is protected. With this key guideline, we optimize our value across each use case, to each individual customer, and to the industry overall.

Research and Development
 In RFID, we’re a leader in a wide range of chip use cases, antenna designs across HF, UHF and LF (low frequency) as well as sensors, materials and form factors. We encompass both sides of the underlying technology platforms, the devices themselves as well as the programmers, testers, configurators and readers. We believe this provides credibility with customers, demonstrating an understanding of all components of the devices in some cases even more deeply than the makers of the devices themselves, because our devices are programming, configuring, testing and validating them at the time of production, as well as in use among customers. Similarly with our physical security IoT platforms, we encompass the total solution. We believe our technology and products span a far greater range of the platform solution than most of our competitors, encompassing readers, controllers, video, cards and software across local, cloud, mobile, and hybrid modes.
 Our research and development (“R&D”) investment is highly leveraged because we optimally access expertise wherever we believe it is most advanced and most efficient. We maintain RFID R&D in Germany, in the region where the initial NFC and smart card technologies developed, and in Singapore/Southeast Asia, where the most advanced and flexible RFID production is centered. We also deploy software and systems teams in Chennai India, Vietnam, Mexico and in the U.S.   
 Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property 
 We currently rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Although we may seek to protect our proprietary technology through patents, it is possible that no new patents will be issued, that our proprietary products or technologies are not patentable, and that any issued patent will fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. The core of our proprietary technology is the combination of our advanced technical expertise combined with our intimate customer knowledge, enabling us to develop bring to market and sometimes patent products uniquely positioned to deliver benefits to customers. We have a portfolio of approximately 36 patent families (designs, patents, utility models, patents pending and exclusive licenses) in individual or regional filings, covering products, electrical and mechanical designs, software systems and methods and manufacturing process ideas for our various businesses. Our issued patents expire between 2022 and 2034. We also submitted and have pending U.S. and foreign patent filings in RFID devices, converged access readers and systems, smart card manufacturing methods, authentication and NFC offerings. Additionally, we leverage our own ASIC designs for smart card interface in some of our reader devices. 
 Manufacturing and Sources of Supply
 We utilize a combination of our own manufacturing facilities and the services of contract manufacturers in various countries around the world to manufacture our products and components. Our RFID devices are predominantly manufactured and assembled by our own internal manufacturing teams in Singapore primarily using locally sourced components and are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 quality manufacturing standard. Our premises sensors readers, controllers and software are manufactured primarily in California. Our video appliances are manufactured primarily in Wisconsin and Arizona. The majority of our smart card reader products and components are manufactured in Singapore, Cambodia and South Korea. We have implemented formal quality control programs to satisfy customer requirements for high quality and reliable products. To ensure that products manufactured by third parties are consistent with internal standards, our quality control programs include management of all key aspects of the production process, including establishing product specifications, selecting the components to be used to produce products, selecting the suppliers of these components and negotiating the prices for certain of these components. In addition, we may work with suppliers to improve process control and product design. 
 For the majority of our product manufacturing, we utilize a global sourcing strategy that serves all business solution areas within the company, which allows us to achieve economies of scale and uniform quality standards for our products. On an ongoing basis, we analyze the need to add alternative sources for both our products and components. For example, we currently utilize the foundry services of external suppliers to produce our ASICs for smart cards readers and RFID devices, and we use chips and antenna components from third-party suppliers. Wherever possible, we have qualified additional sources of supply for components.
