Overview
 
Star Buffet, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “we” or “us”), is a multi-concept restaurant holding company. The Company was incorporated on July 28, 1997. As of January 28, 2019, the Company operated 26 full-service restaurants. Additionally, during the 52-week period ended January 28, 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”), the Company also had five closed restaurants, three closed for remodeling and repositioning, one leased to a third-party operator and one used as a warehouse. One of five closed restaurants held for remodeling and repositioning was sold on December 31, 2018. The Company’s restaurants operate under trade names which, with one exception, are owned by the Company. Certain of the restaurant brands owned and operated by the Company include 4B’s Restaurants®, BuddyFreddys®, Barnhill’s Salads Buffet Desserts®, Casa Bonita®, Pecos Diamond Steakhouse and Frosty Freez. The Company's restaurants are located in Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. The Company has an executive office in Scottsdale, Arizona and management information systems in Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
The Company plans to continue to operate as a multi-concept restaurant holdings company, adding restaurants to its portfolio as proceeds become available to do so. Management believes the Company will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its operations and, together with the proceeds from the sale or refinancing of certain of its properties, to pay its scheduled debt repayments and grow its business.

Growth Strategy
 
The Company’s strategy is to grow primarily through the acquisition of existing restaurants that operate in the family dining, steakhouse or buffet market segments. Depending on the circumstances, these restaurants may be converted to the Company’s existing brands or may remain branded as currently positioned in the market. The Company plans to supplement its acquisitions by purchasing or leasing restaurant real estate that can be converted to the Company’s existing brands. Additionally, the Company may make minority investments in, or enter into strategic alliances with other restaurant chains.

● | Acquisitions. The Company believes that a number of acquisition opportunities exist in the family dining, steakhouses and buffet market segments. The Company believes that many restaurants in these segments are privately owned and may be available for acquisition, particularly when an owner decides to retire. Other restaurants may become available for purchase when corporate owners decide to convert from a company store to a franchisor business model or when a company is faced with a financial reorganization.

● | Restaurant Conversions. In recent years, a number of chains in the family dining and budget steakhouse segments of the restaurant industry have experienced operational difficulties and declining performance. The Company believes that these difficulties are the result of increasing competition from national casual dining and steakhouse chains which offer superior product quality and service at competitive prices. Many of these restaurants and steakhouses occupy desirable locations that the Company believes can be acquired and converted to one of its concepts at lower investment costs or leased at lower investment rates when compared to the cost of new construction.

● | Minority Investments and Strategic Alliances. The Company intends to seek minority investments in, or strategic alliances with other restaurant chains. The Company believes that these investments can provide an attractive opportunity for the Company and may facilitate in the acquisition of restaurants at a later date.

Competition
 
The Company competes on the basis of the quality and value of food products offered, price, service, location, ambiance and overall dining experience. The Company’s competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individually owned restaurants. The number of restaurants with operations similar to those of the Company has grown considerably in recent years. As the Company and its principal competitors expand operations in various geographic areas, competition can be expected to increase.
Government Regulation
 
The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to certain federal and state laws governing minimum wages, unionization, healthcare and other labor issues. These include the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime, paid or family leave, tip credits, working conditions and safety standards. They also include the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which requires among other things the preparation of Form I-9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the United States. Future changes to U.S. immigration laws may result in increased costs of compliance in the solicitation, hiring, and ongoing employment of employees, and correspondingly increase our operating costs.
 
We also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. New or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs.
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by United States governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.
 
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly. Failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.

Seasonality
 
The Company's business is moderately seasonal in nature. For the majority of the Company’s restaurants, the highest volume periods are in the Company’s first and second fiscal quarters.
Segment and Related Reporting
 
All of the brands operated by the Company are in the U.S. within the full-service dining industry. They provide similar products to similar customers and therefore, are considered to be one segment for reporting purposes. The brands possess similar economic characteristics which are expected to achieve similar long-term financial performance. Sales to external customers are derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales.
Employees
 
As of April 19, 2019, the Company employed approximately 815 persons, of whom approximately 810 were restaurant employees. Restaurant employees include salaried management and both full-time and part-time workers paid on an hourly basis. No Company employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
