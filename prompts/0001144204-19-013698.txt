Item 1.    Business
General 
  MB Bancorp, Inc.   MB Bancorp (the “Company”) was incorporated in August 2014 to be the holding company for Madison Bank of Maryland (the “Bank”) following the Bank’s conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership. On December 29, 2014, the mutual to stock conversion was completed and the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Also on that date, the Company sold and issued 2,116,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, through which the Company received net offering proceeds of $20,165,000. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 215,600 shares and 12,700 of its common stock at an average price of $13.07 and $14.50 per share, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the company did not repurchase any shares, however former bank employees exercised a put option from the Employee Stock Ownership Plan for their vested shares (1,720 shares at $14.25 per share). The Company’s principal business activity is the ownership of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Bank. The Company does not own or lease any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank, with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement entered into with the Bank. 
  Madison Bank of Maryland.   Madison Bank of Maryland is the product of the merger of three institutions, The Back & Middle River Building and Loan Association, Inc. (founded in 1912), Madison & Bradford Federal Savings & Loan Association (founded in 1904) and Bohemian American Federal Savings & Loan Association (founded in 1899). In 2002, Bohemian American merged with Madison & Bradford, at which time we changed our name to Madison Bradford/Bohemian American Savings Bank, and in 2004 we shortened our name to Madison Bohemian Savings Bank. In 2006, Back & Middle River merged into Madison Bohemian. In 2009, we adopted our current name, Madison Bank of Maryland. 
 Madison Bank of Maryland is a community-oriented financial institution, dedicated to serving the financial service needs of customers within its market area, which consists of Baltimore and Harford counties in Maryland. We offer a variety of deposit products and provide loans secured by real estate located in our market area. Our real estate loans consist primarily of residential mortgage loans, as well as non-residential real estate loans, construction and land loans and home equity lines of credit. We currently operate out of our corporate headquarters and main office in Forest Hill, Maryland and two full-service branch offices located in Aberdeen and Perry Hall, Maryland. We are subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, our deposit insurer. At December 31, 2018, we had consolidated assets of $150.3 million, total deposits of $97.8 million and total equity of $33.0 million.

Market Area 
 We are headquartered in Forest Hill, Maryland. We maintained offices in Baltimore County and Harford County to serve customers in those markets and occasionally make loans secured by real estate located in nearby counties but outside the markets served by our branches. We consider our deposit and lending market to consist of Baltimore and Harford counties in Maryland. The economy of our market area is a diverse cross section of employment sectors, with a mix of services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail trade, state and local government, health care facilities and finance related employment. Select employers in Baltimore County include the U.S. Social Security Administration, T. Rowe Price Group, McCormick & Company and Lockheed Martin, while Aberdeen Proving Grounds (“APG”) is a major employer both in the military and civilian capacity in Harford County. 
 Demographic and economic growth trends provide key insight into the health of our market area. Baltimore and Harford counties recorded similar population growth from 2010 to 2015 (0.6% annually), which was slightly slower than the Maryland and national growth rates of 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Baltimore County and Harford County reported higher median household and per capita incomes in relation to national averages. Compared to the State of Maryland, Harford County and Baltimore County reported slightly lower income levels. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, median household income for 2018 was $73,805 for Baltimore County and $80,476 for Harford County, compared to $80,776 for Maryland and $60,336 for the United States as a whole. Median household income for 2017 was $68,775 for Baltimore County and $81,052 for Harford County. 
 The unemployment rates for Maryland and the Baltimore and Harford County area was 3.9%, 3.6% and 3.0%, respectively, in December 2018 (below the rates for Maryland 3.9% and the Baltimore metropolitan area 3.7%, respectively, as of December 2017), Baltimore and Harford County fell below the national unemployment rate of 3.9%. Over the past several years, the unemployment rates for Maryland, the Baltimore metropolitan statistical area and Baltimore County have remained more stable than that of the United States with the highest level of unemployment reported in Baltimore County at 7.2% in 2012 as compared to the highest national unemployment rate of 8.5% in 2011. While moderately improving in 2018, Harford County exhibited unemployment data better than the state and national averages through December 2018, with rates varying from 4.0% in July 2018 to 3.0% in December 2018. The demographic information is based on information provided by The Office of Workforce Information and Performance (OWIP). 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies such as securities brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. In addition, banks owned by large national and regional holding companies and other community-based banks also operate in our primary market area. Most of these institutions are larger than us and, therefore, may have greater resources. 
 Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions, including credit unions, in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial services companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet, and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law now permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future. 
Lending Activities 
  General.   The largest segment of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans, consisting primarily of residential mortgage loans, and, to a lesser extent, non-residential real estate loans, construction and land loans and home equity lines of credit. The only consumer loans we offer are loans to depositors secured by savings accounts, and we currently do not offer commercial loans; the commercial real estate loans currently in our portfolio were originated years ago. We are a portfolio lender and retain in our portfolio substantially all loans we originate. 
 The following is a description of the loans we offer and our lending policies. On occasion, as described below, we may choose to originate a loan that does not fully conform to our loan policies. However, such exceptions are extremely rare and the amounts involved are immaterial. Any exceptions to our loan policies must be approved by the individuals or committee having authority to approve a comparable loan that conformed fully to our lending policies. For information regarding loan approval procedures and authority, see “— Loan Underwriting — Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.”
  Residential Mortgage Loans.   At December 31, 2018, we had $78.4 million in residential mortgage loans, which represented 76.8% of our total loan portfolio. Our origination of residential mortgage loans enables borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which are located in our primary market area. Included in residential mortgage loans are loans secured by one- to four-family properties, which totaled $77.2 million at December 31, 2018, and loans secured by multi-family properties, which totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2018. Of our residential mortgage loans, at December 31, 2018, $69.8 million, or 89.2% of residential mortgage loans, were secured by owner-occupied residences, $7.2 million, or 9.1% of residential mortgage loans, were secured by investor-owned properties, $1.2 million, or 1.5% of residential mortgage loans, were secured by multi-family properties and $172,000, or 0.2% of residential mortgage loans, were second mortgage loans. 
 We offer fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years, although we prefer to originate residential mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or less. We offer conforming conventional mortgage loans, which are loans of $417,000 or less with additional requirements, such as, down payment amount and credit history, as well as jumbo mortgage loans, which are loans that exceed that amount. Although we have not sold residential mortgage loans in recent years, we generally originate residential mortgage loans in conformance with secondary market guidelines. We are currently offering adjustable-rate loans. We determine the loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans based on our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. 
 While residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans on a regular basis. We do not offer residential mortgage loans with negative amortization, and we generally do not make interest only residential mortgage loans, although we have, on limited occasions, made interest only loans where there were exceptional income or credit characteristics associated with the loan. 
 We make owner occupied residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% require private mortgage insurance. In addition, non-owner occupied one to four family residential real estate loan-to-value ratios may not exceed 75%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We also

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for all loans located in special flood hazard areas. We do not offer, and have not offered, sub-prime or no-documentation mortgage loans. 
 Included in residential mortgage loans are second mortgage loans. Second mortgage loans are made at fixed rates for terms of up to 15 years and in amounts of up to $200,000. We do not offer second mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%, including any first mortgage loan balance. Second mortgage loans totaled $172,000 at December 31, 2018 and represented 0.2% of residential mortgage loans at such date. 
  Non-residential Real Estate Loans.   At December 31, 2018, we had $15.7 million of non-residential real estate loans in our portfolio. The non-residential real estate securing these loans generally consists of churches, small office buildings and marinas. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our largest non-residential real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $3.0 million and was secured by a retail building and mixed use retail, professional building located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2018. 
  Construction and Land Loans.   At December 31, 2018, we had $3.0 million of construction and land loans, which represented 2.9% of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, construction and land loans consisted of $2.0 million of construction loans, amounting to 65.9% of our construction and land loan portfolio, and $1.0 million of land loans, amounting to 34.1% of our construction and land loan portfolio. 
 We originate loans for the construction of one- to four-family homes. We originate loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of only interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 12 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% on residential construction, based on the lesser of the appraised value as if complete or the sum of all costs to the borrower, including the cost of the land and construction costs. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent appraiser, and we may require a feasibility study to ensure that the lot is buildable. We also will generally require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. 
 We also originate loans to individuals for the purpose of purchasing land for future construction of one- to four-family residences. We offer land loans at a fixed-rate for a term of 20 years but are callable after five years. We limit the loan-to-value ratio to a maximum of 65%. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest construction and land loan relationship was a $980,000 loan secured by a single family home in Baltimore County, Maryland. 
  Home Equity Lines of Credit.   We offer home equity lines of credit in amounts of up to $200,000, although on occasion, in the past, we have approved home equity lines of credit in excess of this amount. All of our home equity lines of credit currently offered are adjustable-rate loans with rates tied to the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal and terms of up to 20 years. We do not originate home equity loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%, including any first mortgage loan balance. Our home equity lines of credit are not necessarily secured by residential real estate on which we also maintain the first mortgage. At December 31, 2018, home equity lines of credit totaled $2.7 million, or 2.6% of our total loan portfolio. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding balance on a home equity line of credit was $348,000, and the line of credit is secured by a residential property in Harford County, Maryland. 
  Consumer Loans & C&I Loans.   The only consumer loans we offer are loans to depositors, secured by savings. At December 31, 2018, we had no consumer loans. We offer commercial loans that are secured by property or deposit accounts at our bank. At December 31, 2018, commercial loans totaled $2.3 million, or 2.32% of our total loan portfolio.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Loan Underwriting 
  Construction and Land Loans.   Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance draw funds beyond the amount originally scheduled to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment if liquidation is required. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, we may be unable to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. We also disburse funds on a percentage-of-completion basis following an inspection by a third party inspector or qualified bank personnel. 
  Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit.   In the case of home equity loans and lines of credit, real estate values may be reduced to a level that is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance after accounting for the first mortgage loan balance. Loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
  Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.   Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Loans equal to or less than $250,000 must be approved by any two members of our Loan Committee, which consists of senior management. Our Officer Loan Committee, which consists of five members of senior management, has authority to approve loans in amounts over $250,000 and up to $800,000. All loans in excess of $800,000 must be approved by the majority of the Board of Directors prior to a commitment being made. 
  Loans to One Borrower.   The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is limited, by regulation, to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory limit on loans-to-one-borrower was $4.2 million. Notwithstanding our regulatory loans-to-one-borrower limitation, our current policy is to limit our loans to one borrower to no more than $3.0 million. At December 31, 2018, our largest lending relationship was a loan totaling $3.0 million. The loan was performing at December 31, 2018. There are two properties in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, secured by a retail building and a mixed use retail, professional building. Both properties are a participation with another financial institution. For further information, see “Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Financial Condition — Risk Management — Classified Assets.” 
  Loan Commitments.   We issue commitments for residential mortgages conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Most of our loan commitments expire after 30 days. See note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Investment Activities 
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, we also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta stock. 
 At December 31, 2018, our investment securities for the Bank included securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity. We account for investment and mortgage-backed securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 320, “Investments – Debt and Equity Securities.” Accounting

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Standards Codification 320 requires that investments be categorized as held-to-maturity, trading, or available for sale. In addition to our investment portfolio, at December 31, 2018, we maintained a $940,000 investment, at cost, in Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta common stock. 
 Our primary investment objectives are: (i) to provide and maintain liquidity; (ii) to fully employ the available funds of the Company and the Bank; (iii) to earn an average rate of return on invested funds competitive with comparable institutions; (iv) to manage interest rate risk; and (v) to limit risk. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the implementation of our policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our board of directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a monthly basis. 
 Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 
  General.   Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. 
  Deposit Accounts.   Deposits generally are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), statement savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We also utilize QwickRate, a direct deposit listing service and our own internet website to generate deposits. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, and profitability to us, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing bi-weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has typically been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products, and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
  Borrowings.   We had $19.0 million in borrowings at December 31, 2018, consisting of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta to supplement our investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth, the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness, collateral value and level of Federal Home Loan Bank stock ownership. We had unused borrowing capacity of approximately $18.5 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we maintain a $2.5 million line of credit with another bank and access to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window; no amounts were outstanding under the lines of credit at December 31, 2018. 
Personnel 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 23 full-time employees and four part-time employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
Subsidiaries 
 Madison Bank of Maryland has two subsidiaries, both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries. 1920 Rock Spring Road, LLC was formed in 1998 to own and hold real estate. At December 31, 2018, its primary asset was the real estate where Madison Bank of Maryland’s headquarters is located. Mutual, LLC was formed in 2011 to hold other real estate owned. At December 31, 2018, Mutual, LLC owned no properties.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Regulation and Supervision 
 General 
 Madison Bank of Maryland, as a federal savings bank, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as its primary federal regulator, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the insurer of its deposits. Its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Madison Bank of Maryland must file reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to evaluate Madison Bank of Maryland’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, MB Bancorp is subject to examination and supervision by, and be required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) made extensive changes to the regulation of Madison Bank of Maryland and will continue to affect, into the immediate future, the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks such as Madison Bank of Maryland was transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on July 21, 2011. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as Madison Bank of Maryland, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulators. 
 Certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Madison Bank of Maryland and MB Bancorp are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Madison Bank of Maryland and MB Bancorp. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
  Business Activities.   The activities of federal savings banks, such as Madison Bank of Maryland, are governed by federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings banks, (e.g., commercial, nonresidential real property loans and consumer loans), is limited to a specified percentage of the institution’s capital or assets. 
  Capital Requirements.   In early July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. “Basel III” refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements. 

 7

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revised the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to Madison Bank of Maryland are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. In addition, the rules assign a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rules also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. However, instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities), subject to a two-year transition period. 
 The rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 
 In September 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency proposed a rule intended to reduce regulatory burden by simplifying several requirements in the agencies’ regulatory capital rule. Most aspects of the proposed rule would apply only to banking organizations that are not subject to the “advanced approaches” in the capital rule, which are generally firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total foreign exposure. The proposal would simplify and clarify a number of the more complex aspects of the existing capital rule. Specifically, the proposed rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain acquisition, development, and construction loans, mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. A final rule has not yet been issued. 
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. 
  Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.   Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept broker deposits. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures. 
  Insurance of Deposit Accounts.   Madison Bank of Maryland’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Madison Bank of Maryland. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 
  Loans to One Borrower.   Federal law provides that savings banks are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, a savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory loans-to-one borrower limitation was $4.2 million. Notwithstanding this regulatory limitation, our current policy is not to make loans to one borrower in excess of $3.0 million. 
  Qualified Thrift Lender Test.   Federal law requires savings banks to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings bank is required to either qualify as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities but also including education, credit card and small business loans) in at least nine months out of each 12-month period. 
 A savings bank that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions and the Dodd-Frank Act also specifies that failing the qualified thrift lender test is a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action and dividend limitations. As of December 31, 2018, Madison Bank of Maryland maintained 80.4% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test. 
  Limitation on Capital Distributions.   Federal regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings bank, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the prior approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required before any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for “expedited treatment” of applications under Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations (i.e., generally, examination and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide 30 days prior written notice to, and receive the non-objection of, the Federal Reserve Board of the capital distribution if, like Madison Bank of Maryland, it is a subsidiary of a holding company, as well as an informational notice filing to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If Madison Bank of Maryland’s capital ever fell below its regulatory requirements or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

  Community Reinvestment Act.   All federal savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution’s failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. Responsibility for administering the Community Reinvestment Act, unlike other fair lending laws, was not transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Madison Bank of Maryland received an “Outstanding” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination. 
  Transactions with Related Parties.   Federal law limits Madison Bank of Maryland’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with Madison Bank of Maryland, including MB Bancorp and its other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings bank. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings bank’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings banks are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings bank may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by MB Bancorp to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, Madison Bank of Maryland’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities of such person’s control is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that Madison Bank of Maryland may make to insiders based, in part, on Madison Bank of Maryland’s capital level and require that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved. 
  Enforcement.   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency currently has primary enforcement responsibility over savings banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1.0 million per day in especially egregious cases. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings bank. If action is not taken by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
  Federal Home Loan Bank System.   Madison Bank of Maryland is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Madison Bank of Maryland, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. Madison Bank of Maryland was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock at December 31, 2018 of $940,000. 
  Federal Reserve System.   The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings banks to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations provide that reserves be maintained against 

 10

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $124.2 million; and a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements.

 ​
 Holding Company Regulation 
  General.   As a savings and loan holding company, MB Bancorp is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations regarding its activities. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Madison Bank of Maryland. 
 Pursuant to federal law and regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company such as MB Bancorp may generally engage in the activities permitted for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and certain other activities that have been authorized for savings and loan holding companies by regulation. 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings bank, or savings and loan holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board or from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary holding company or savings bank. A savings and loan holding company is also prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings banks, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
 The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings banks in more than one state, except: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings bank in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings bank specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 
  Capital Requirements.   Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule established consolidated capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies with consolidated assets over $1 million. Because MB Bancorp does not exceed this threshold, it is not subject to this requirement. See “Regulation and Supervision — Federal Banking Regulation — Capital Requirements.”
  Source of Strength.   The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy requiring that holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
  Dividends and Stock Repurchases.   The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by savings and loan holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Federal Reserve Board policy also provides that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. 
  Acquisition of MB Bancorp.   Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company or savings bank. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or institution, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control. A change in control definitely occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 The JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” MB Bancorp, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, MB Bancorp, Inc. will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. We have irrevocably elected not to adopt new or revised accounting standards on a delayed basis, and will be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards in the same manner as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
 Federal Income Taxation 
  General.   We report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. Our federal income tax returns have not been audited during the last five years. For its 2018 calendar year, Madison Bank of Maryland’s maximum statutory federal income tax rate was 21%.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 MB Bancorp and Madison Bank of Maryland have entered into a tax allocation agreement. Because MB Bancorp owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Madison Bank of Maryland after the completion of the conversion, MB Bancorp and Madison Bank of Maryland are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, of which group MB Bancorp will be the common parent corporation. As a result of this affiliation, Madison Bank of Maryland may be included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with MB Bancorp and, if a decision to file a consolidated tax return is made, the parties agree to compensate each other for their individual share of the consolidated tax liability and/or any tax benefits provided by them in the filing of the consolidated federal income tax return. 
  Bad Debt Reserves.   For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and require savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. 
  Distributions.   If Madison Bank of Maryland makes “non-dividend distributions” to MB Bancorp, the distributions will be considered to have been made from Madison Bank of Maryland’s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from Madison Bank of Maryland’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in Madison Bank of Maryland’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of Madison Bank of Maryland’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of Madison Bank of Maryland’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be included in Madison Bank of Maryland’s taxable income. 
 The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if Madison Bank of Maryland makes a non-dividend distribution to MB Bancorp, approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate. Madison Bank of Maryland does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves. 
 State Taxation 
 The state of Maryland imposes an income tax of approximately 8.25% on income measured substantially the same as federally taxable income. The State of Maryland currently assesses a personal property tax for December 2000 and forward. 
Executive Officers Who Are Not Directors 
 The executive officers of MB Bancorp and Madison Bank of Maryland are elected annually by the Board of Directors and serve at the board’s discretion. 
 Below is information regarding our other executive officers who are not directors. Ages presented are as of December 31, 2018.
