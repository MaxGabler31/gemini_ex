B. UTILITY SEGMENT
Electric Utility Operations
We generate and distribute electric energy to customers located in southeastern Wisconsin (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central Wisconsin, and northern Wisconsin. We also served an iron ore mine customer, Tilden, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, through March 31, 2019 when Tilden became a customer of UMERC, an affiliated public utility owned by WEC Energy Group. In 2021, our consolidated revenues also included securitization revenues collected from customers as servicer of environmental control property owned by our subsidiary WEPCo Environmental Trust. For more information on WEPCo Environmental Trust, see Note 19, Variable Interest Entities.
Operating Revenues
For information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, see Note 4, Operating Revenues.
Electric Sales
Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail, wholesale, and resale customers. In 2021, retail revenues accounted for 91.9% of total electric operating revenues, wholesale revenues accounted for 2.2% of total electric operating revenues, and resale revenues accounted for 4.7% of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Utility Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common Shareholder for information on MWh sales by customer class.
We are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities.
We buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets compared to our competitors affects how often our generating units are dispatched and whether we

Table of Contents

buy or sell power, based on our customers' needs. We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. For more information, see C. Regulation.
The majority of our sales for resale are sold into an energy market operated by MISO at market rates based on availability of our generation and market demand. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the costs of sales derived from these opportunity sales.
Steam Sales
We have a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by the VAPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions.
Electric Sales Forecast
Our service territory experienced higher weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2021, as compared with 2020, due to a partial recovery from the impact of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes to grow between 0.5% and 1.0% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. Electric peak demand is expected to be flat over the next five years.

Electric Commercial and Industrial Retail Customers
We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in industries such as metals and other manufacturing, governmental, health services, real estate, and food products.
Electric Generation and Supply Mix
Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to balance a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity with environmental stewardship. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own or lease from We Power. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term PPAs, including the Point Beach PPA discussed under the heading "Power Purchase Commitments," and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess power supply into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.

(1)    The values included in the estimate assume a natural gas price based on the December 2021 NYMEX.
(2)    In 2021, we used more coal generation for electric supply, compared with 2020. Even though coal costs also increased in 2021, it was still more cost effective than natural gas due to increased natural gas prices in 2021. We still anticipate using less coal in the future as we plan to achieve our emission reduction goals through the addition of renewable generation and eventual closure of existing coal generating facilities if approved by regulators.
(3)    Includes hydroelectric, biomass, solar, and wind generation.
Electric Generation Facilities
Our generation portfolio is a mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to balance providing energy that is stable, reliable, and affordable with environmental stewardship. We own or lease 5,066 MW of generation capacity. Our facilities include coal-fired plants, natural gas-fired plants, and renewable generation. Certain of our natural gas-fired generation units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our facilities, see Item 2. Properties.
Generation from Leased W.E. Power, LLC Units
We supply electricity to our customers from power plants that we lease from We Power. These plants include the ERGS units and the PWGS units. Lease payments are billed from We Power to us and then recovered in our rates as authorized by the PSCW and the FERC. We operate the We Power units and are authorized by the PSCW and state law to fully recover prudently incurred operating and maintenance costs in our electric rates. As the operator of the units, we may request We Power to make capital improvements to, or further investments in, the units. Under the lease terms, these capital improvements or further investments will increase lease payments paid by us and should ultimately be recovered in our rates.
Creating a Sustainable Future
WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and clean natural gas-fired generation. When taken together, the retirements and new investments should better balance supply with our demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. The retirements will contribute to meeting WEC Energy Group's and our goals to reduce CO2 emissions from electric generation.
In May 2021, WEC Energy Group announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from its electric generation fleet by 60% by 2025 and by 80% by 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. WEC Energy Group expects to achieve these goals by making operating 

2021 Form 10-K | 5 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Table of Contents

refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing its capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for its generation fleet is net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
As part of our path toward these goals, we are exploring co-firing with natural gas at the ERGS coal-fired units. By the end of 2030, WEC Energy Group expects its use of coal will account for less than 5% of the power it supplies to its customers, and WEC Energy Group believes it will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by 2035. 
WEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 MWs of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2019 retirement of the PIPP as well as the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. Through the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by 2025, which includes the planned retirement in 2023-2024 of OCPP Units 5-8.
In August 2021, the PSCW approved pilot programs for us to install and maintain EV charging equipment for customers at their homes or businesses. The programs provide direct benefits to customers by removing cost barriers associated with installing EV equipment. In October 2021, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, WEC Energy Group pledged to expand the EV charging network within the service territories of its electric utilities. In doing so, WEC Energy Group joined a coalition of utility companies in a unified effort to make EV charging convenient and widely available throughout the Midwest. The coalition WEC Energy Group joined is planning to help build and grow EV charging corridors, enabling the general public to safely and efficiently charge their vehicles.
See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate Developments for more information on the ESG Progress Plan.
Renewable Generation
We meet a portion of our electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources, including wind, hydroelectric, and biomass. We are also constructing solar projects, which are discussed in more detail below. This helps us maintain compliance with renewable energy legislation. These renewable energy resources also help us maintain diversity in our generation portfolio, which effectively serves as a price hedge against future fuel costs, and will help mitigate the risk of potential unknown costs associated with any future carbon restrictions for electric generators.
In December 2018, we received approval from the PSCW for the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot program, a program for large commercial and industrial customers who wish to access renewable resources that we will operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio, and helping these larger customers meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.
Wind
In September 2021, we, along with WPS, received approval to accelerate capital investments to repower major components of Blue Sky, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
Solar and Battery Storage
As part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we have filed applications with the PSCW for approval to invest in 563 MW of utility-scale solar and 262 MW of battery storage, including the following: 
•In April 2021, we, along with WPS and an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire the Koshkonong Solar-Battery Park, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Dane County, Wisconsin and once constructed, we will own 225 MW of solar generation and 124 MW of battery storage of this project. If approved, construction of the project is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2024.
•In March 2021, we, along with WPS and an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire and construct the Darien Solar-Battery Park, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Rock and Walworth counties, Wisconsin and once constructed, we will own 188 MW of solar generation and 56 MW of battery storage of this project. If approved, construction of the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

•In February 2021, we, along with WPS and an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire and construct the Paris Solar-Battery Park, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Kenosha County, Wisconsin and once constructed, we will own 150 MW of solar generation and 82 MW of battery storage of this project. If approved, construction of the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.
We have received approval from the PSCW to invest in 135 MW of utility-scale solar projects, including the following:
•In August 2019, we partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct a solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin and is expected to enter commercial operation in the first quarter of 2023. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of this project. 
•In December 2018, we received approval from the PSCW for the Solar Now pilot program, which is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to our portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, we have energized 21 Solar Now projects and currently have another three under construction, together totaling more than 27 MW.
Natural Gas-Fired Generation
We have filed applications with the PSCW for approval to invest in up to 282.3 MW of natural gas-fired generation, including the following: 
•In December 2021, we, along with WPS, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire Whitewater, a commercially operational 236.5 MW dual fueled (natural gas and low sulfur fuel oil) combined cycle electrical generation facility in Whitewater, Wisconsin. If approved, our share of this facility for 50% of the capacity is 118.3 MW, with the transaction expected to close in January 2023.
•In April 2021, we, along with WPS, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to construct a natural gas-fired generation facility at WPS's existing Weston power plant site in northern Wisconsin. The new facility will consist of seven reciprocating internal combustion engines. Once constructed, we will own 64 MW of this project. If approved, construction of the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.
In addition, in January 2022, WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire a portion of West Riverside's nameplate capacity. WPS is also requesting approval to assign the option to purchase part of West Riverside to us. If approved, we or WPS would acquire 100 MW of capacity, in the first of two potential option exercises. West Riverside is a new, combined-cycle natural gas plant recently completed by an unaffiliated utility in Rock County, Wisconsin. If approved, the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.
Electric System Reliability
The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has an 18.3% installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022, and a 17.9% installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023. MISO's short-term reserve margin requirements experience year-to-year fluctuations, primarily due to changes in the generation resource mix and average forced outage rate of generation within the MISO footprint.
We believe that we have adequate capacity through company-owned generation units, leased generating units, and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during the current planning year. We also fully anticipate that we will have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements for the upcoming planning year.

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW generally allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. For more information about the fuel rules, see C. Regulation.
Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type, including delivery costs, were as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Coal | $ | 20.11 | | | $ | 18.67 | | $ | 22.05
Natural gas combined cycle | 24.35 | | | 15.84 | | | 19.35 
Natural gas/oil peaking units | 81.06 | | | 41.71 | | | 53.66 
Biomass | 86.24 | | | 130.76 | | | 102.99
Purchased power | 52.84 | | | 48.90 | | | 46.90 

We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. In the past, coal and associated transportation services were exposed to volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and diesel fuel. We have PSCW approval for a hedging program to moderate this volatility exposure. This program allows us to hedge, over a 36-month period, up to 75% of our potential risks related to rail transportation fuel surcharge exposure. The results of this hedging program, when used, are reflected in the average costs of fuel and purchased power.
We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. We also have PSCW approval for a hedging program to moderate volatility related to natural gas price risk. This program allows us to hedge, over a 36-month period, up to 75% of our estimated natural gas use for electric generation. The results of this hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas.
Coal Supply
We diversify the coal supply for our leased and owned electric generating facilities by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania, as well as from various other states. For 2022, all of our projected coal requirements of 4.9 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.
The annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next three years are as follows.

(in thousands) | Annual Tonnage
2022 | 5,293 
2023 | 2,900 
2024 | 950 

Coal Deliveries
All of our coal requirements are expected to be shipped by unit trains that we own or lease under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities.
Power Purchase Commitments
We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. Our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties consists of 1,033 MW per year for 2022 through 2026 related to a long-term PPA for electricity generated by Point Beach, which exclude planning capacity purchases. Through WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan, we retired some of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation in 2018 and 2019. To procure additional planning capacity, we purchased capacity from the MISO annual auction to ensure that we maintain our compliance with planning reserve requirements as established by the PSCW and MISO.

Seasonality
Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. In 2021, our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, we did not require public appeals for conservation, and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. 
Competition
We face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by customers and alternative energy sources. We compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business.
For more information on competition in our service territory, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Competitive Markets.
Natural Gas Utility Operations
We are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. We operate in three distinct service areas including west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area, and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin.
We provide natural gas utility service to residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers. Major industries served include real estate, restaurants, food products, governmental, and health services. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Utility Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common Shareholder for information on natural gas sales volumes by customer class.
Operating Revenues
For information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, see Note 4, Operating Revenues.
Natural Gas Sales Forecast
Our service territory experienced lower weather-normalized retail natural gas deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for electric generation) in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the impact of a full year of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and higher natural gas prices. We currently forecast retail natural gas delivery volumes to grow at a rate between 0.7% and 1.0% over the next five years, assuming normal weather.

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage
We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies.
Pipeline Capacity and Storage
The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin access supply from natural gas producing areas in the Southern and Eastern United States, along with western Canada. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio.
Due to variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We have entered into a long-term service agreement for natural gas storage with a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluewater. Bluewater, a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, owns natural gas storage facilities in Michigan and provides approximately one-third of our current storage needs. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 40% of forecasted demand for November through March. Diversity of natural gas supply enables us to manage significant changes in demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months and withdraw it in the winter months.
We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts.
Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRM. For information on our GCRM, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues.
To ensure a reliable supply of natural gas during peak winter conditions, we have LNG and propane facilities located within our distribution system. These facilities are typically utilized during extreme demand conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers. In addition to our existing facilities, we plan to construct an additional LNG facility. The facility would provide us with approximately one Bcf of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. Commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.
Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our forecasted design peak-day throughput is 10.6 million therms for the 2021 through 2022 heating season. Our peak daily send-out during 2021 was 6.8 million therms on February 14, 2021.
Natural Gas Supply
We have contracts with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in some of the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices.
We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market.
Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices
We have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. This approval allows us to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums, brokerage fees and losses) and proceeds (gains) to customers through our GCRM.
To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRM.

Seasonality
Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.
Our working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of our winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.
Competition
We face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. In addition, all of our customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. We offer natural gas transportation services for customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. We continue to earn distribution revenues from these transportation customers for their use of our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.
For more information on competition in our service territory, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Competitive Markets.
Environmental Goals
WEC Energy Group continues to reduce methane emissions by improving its natural gas distribution systems. WEC Energy Group set a target across its natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. WEC Energy Group plans to achieve its net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout its utility systems.
C. REGULATION
In addition to the specific regulations noted below, we are also subject to various other regulations, which primarily consist of regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
Rates
Our retail electric, natural gas, and steam rates are regulated by the PSCW, and the FERC regulates our wholesale electric rates. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

(1)    Tilden was our customer through March 31, 2019. Tilden became a customer of UMERC when UMERC's natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation. Prior to its generating units achieving commercial operation, UMERC purchased a portion of its power from us. The revenues received from UMERC are included in the FERC – Wholesale line above. See Note 3, Related Parties, for additional information.
Retail Rates
The PSCW has general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in its jurisdiction including, but not limited to, approval of retail utility rates and standards of service, security issuances, mergers, affiliate transactions, location and construction of electric generating units and natural gas facilities, and certain other additions and extensions to utility facilities. 
Historically, retail rates approved by the PSCW have been designed to provide utilities the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, along with a return on investment sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction. We are subject to an earnings sharing mechanism in which a portion of our earnings are required to be refunded to customers if we earn above our authorized ROE. See Note 22, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our earnings sharing mechanism. The table below reflects our approved ROE and capital structure during 2021.

Regulated Retail Rates | Regulatory Commission | Authorized ROE | Average Common Equity Component
Electric, natural gas, and steam | PSCW | 10.0% | 52.5% 

In addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, we have certain recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund prudently incurred costs that differ from those approved in base rates.
Embedded within our electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of our symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of our approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. Our deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If our ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which our return exceeds the authorized amount.
Our natural gas utility operates under a GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 
See Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for more information on the significant mechanisms we had in place during 2021 that allowed us to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts.
We file periodic requests with the PSCW for changes in retail rates. Our rate requests are based on forward looking test years, which reflect additions to infrastructure and changes in costs incurred or expected to be incurred. For information on our regulatory proceedings, see Note 22, Regulatory Environment. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at https://psc.wi.gov/. The material and information contained on this website are not intended to be a part of, nor are they incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Wholesale Rates
The FERC regulates our wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services. We have received market-based rate authority from the FERC. Market-based rate authority allows wholesale electric sales to be made in the MISO market and directly to third parties based on the negotiated market value of the transaction. We also make wholesale sales pursuant to cost-based formula rates. Cost-based formula rates provide for recovery of our costs and an approved rate of return. The predetermined formula is initially based on our expenses from the previous year, but is eventually trued up to reflect actual, current-year costs.
Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets
In connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO operates bid-based energy markets. MISO is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the electric transmission system in its footprint.

In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint.
As part of MISO, a market-based platform is used for valuing transmission congestion premised upon an LMP system. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022. The resulting ARR allocation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.
MISO has an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources can be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. All of our capacity requirements during the planning year from June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022 were met.
Other Electric Regulations
We are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.
We are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin which contains certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation.
All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations.
Other Natural Gas Regulations
Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the PSCW are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas safety compliance programs for our pipelines under United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 CFR Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline).
We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territory. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to our low-income customers.
Compliance Costs
The regulations and oversight described above significantly influence our operating environment, and may cause us to incur compliance and other related costs and may affect our ability to recover these costs from our utility customers. Any anticipated capital expenditures for compliance with government regulations for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Requirements.

D. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our operations, especially as they relate to our coal-fired generating facilities, are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation related to GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, water use, or wastewater discharges and other climate change issues, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.
Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and certain remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Requirements. For a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change, see Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies.
E. HUMAN CAPITAL
We believe our employees are among our most important resources, so investing in human capital is critical to our success. We strive to foster a diverse workforce and inclusive workplace; attract, retain and develop talented personnel; and keep our employees safe and healthy.
WEC Energy Group's Board of Directors retains collective responsibility for comprehensive risk oversight of WEC Energy Group and its subsidiaries, including critical areas that could impact our sustainability, such as human capital. Management regularly reports to WEC Energy Group's Board of Directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, employee development, and safety and health. WEC Energy Group's Board of Directors delegates specified duties to its committees. In addition to its responsibilities relative to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has oversight responsibility for reviewing organizational matters that could significantly impact us, including succession planning.

Safety and Health
WEC Energy Group's Executive Safety Committee directs our safety and health strategy, works to ensure consistency across groups, and reinforces our ongoing safety commitment that we refer to as “Target Zero.” Under our Target Zero commitment, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus. We monitor and set goals for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lost-time incidents and days away, restricted or transferred (DART) metrics, as well as leading indicators, which together raise awareness about employee safety and guide injury-prevention activities.
We also provide employees various benefits and resources designed to promote healthy living, both at work and at home. We encourage employees to receive preventive examinations and to proactively care for their health through free health screenings, wellness challenges, and other resources. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees and customers. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Coronavirus Disease – 2019, for additional information.
Development and Training
Employee training and development of both technical and leadership skills are integral aspects of our human capital strategy. We provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including online training, simulations, live classes, and mentoring to assist with their career advancement. These programs include safety and technical job skill training as well as soft-skill programs focused on relevant subjects, including communication and change management. Development of leadership skills remains a top priority and is specialized for all levels of employees. We have specific leadership programs for aspiring leaders and new supervisors, managers, and directors.
