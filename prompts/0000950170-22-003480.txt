ITEM 1. Business.
Mission
 Our mission is to transform how middle market businesses receive, manage and pay their bills.
Overview
 We are a leading provider of accounts payable ("AP") automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers. Our Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") based, end-to-end software and payment platform digitizes and automates the AP workflows for more than 8,000 businesses (our buyers) and we have made payments to more than 825,000 supplier customers of our buyers (suppliers) over the past five years. While acquiring new and retaining existing relationships with buyers and suppliers are important to our business, the growth of our business is ultimately dependent upon the number of transactions we process, as well as our total payment volume. We developed our technology platform through years of working to solve our buyers’ unique middle market workflow challenges. Leveraging our deep domain expertise, we purpose-built a powerful two-sided network that connects buyers and suppliers, drives digital transformation, increases efficiency and accuracy in AP workflows, accelerates payments, enables insight into critical analytics, and lowers operating costs for our buyers.
 The majority of businesses continue to operate paper-intensive back offices, particularly in their AP workflows. According to a study by the Association of Finance Professionals, 42% of business-to-business ("B2B") payment volumes in the United States are executed with paper checks. These manual payment methods are accompanied by complicated and labor-intensive steps to process invoices that are slow, expensive and vulnerable to error and fraud.
 While solutions have been developed to address this friction, they are predominantly suited for larger enterprises and small and midsize businesses (each an "SMB"). Larger enterprises can purchase expensive and highly sophisticated tools because they have the financial resources and talent base to support these systems. Meanwhile, SMBs more often utilize one-size-fits-all solutions that address simplistic or single-step workflows in less sophisticated business environments.
 The middle market, however, remains underserved. We define middle market businesses primarily as companies with between $5 million and $1 billion in annual revenue. They have high invoice throughput, complex AP workflows and general ledger coding that are too sophisticated for the solutions typically utilized by SMBs. However, middle market businesses also operate at a smaller scale than the typical enterprise, which makes the more complicated enterprise solutions cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement. Additionally, the technology landscape for the middle market is highly fragmented and siloed, requiring a flexible technology stack that integrates with multiple software providers to automate workflows.
 We built our business to solve this gap for the middle market and believe we have become a uniquely strategic platform for our customers’ CFOs, treasurers and finance teams by digitally transforming how they receive, manage and pay their bills. Supported by deep integrations to our customers’ middle market oriented accounting and information systems, our platform automates the end-to-end AP workflows for our buyers and enhances the payment experience for our suppliers through the following products and features:
•AP Automation Software. We have developed a SaaS-based solution automating and digitizing the capture, review, approval and payment of invoices for our buyers. Our omni-channel ingestion engine provides unique, vertical-specific front-end software tools that streamline AP workflows for our buyers. We digitally capture invoices from suppliers and apply the buyer’s specific business rules to enable them to begin processing the invoice, extract and utilize transaction data from the invoice to enhance and configure the approval workflows, and manage the entire AP process through the payment of the invoice.
 •The AvidPay Network. Our two-sided payments network connects our buyers with their suppliers, enabling invoice payments on behalf of a buyer and according to the supplier’s business rules, payment preferences and remittance data. We support a variety of payment methods depending on the supplier’s preference, including virtual credit card ("VCC"), enhanced automated clearing house ("ACH") (our AvidPay Direct) and physical check, while delivering rich remittance data to streamline the reconciliation process.
 •Cash Flow Manager. We provide cash management solutions to our supplier network, including tools that provide a comprehensive view of invoices and an accelerator feature (our Invoice Accelerator). These additional features, and 


others in our product pipeline, allow us to both monetize and increase engagement on our two-sided payments network.
 As indicated above, we serve over 8,000 buyers and have made payments to over 825,000 suppliers over the past five years. We do not have significant customer concentration in our business, with no single customer contributing more than 5% of 2021 revenue and with our top 10 customers contributing less than 15% of revenue in 2021 and 2020. Our customers operate across a variety of verticals in which we have deep domain expertise, including real estate, HOAs, construction, financial services (including banks and credit unions), healthcare facilities, social services, education, and media. Certain segments of our customers, particularly the customers we acquired through the FastPay acquisition that focus on political advertising within our media vertical, are subject to seasonal and cyclical trends. In 2021, we processed approximately 62 million transactions representing over $180 billion in spend under management across our platform and, of that spend, we moved $52 billion in total payment volume from our buyers to their suppliers. Spend under management represents the sum of (i) the aggregate dollar amount of payments processed by us, plus (ii) the aggregate dollar amount represented by the total number of invoices processed by us, in each case, during the specified period. As described in more detail in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we generate revenue from each transaction processed on a per transaction basis and earn interchange revenue from a portion of the total payment volume.
 Our two-sided AvidPay Network of buyers and suppliers drives a powerful flywheel. We believe that by delivering a world-class AP automation experience, we attract more buyers and increase the number of transactions processed through our system. We also leverage our direct connections to our supplier network to increase penetration of electronic payments, which attracts more suppliers to our network. We capture more data from these additional transactions and e-payments that we use to continuously improve our AP automation experience, drawing more buyers, suppliers and, as a result, more transactions to our platform, which continues to fuel our organic growth. As we add more buyers to the AvidPay Network, both buyers and their suppliers benefit from our current network density which drives electronic payment adoption. In addition, new buyers bring new suppliers, thereby enabling us to continuously add more suppliers to the AvidPay Network and accelerating the flywheel of growth depicted below.
 
We sell our solutions through a hybrid go-to-market strategy that includes direct and indirect channels. Our direct sales force leverages their deep domain expertise in select verticals and over 180 referral relationships with integrated software providers, financial institutions and other partners to identify and attract buyers that would benefit from our AP software solutions and the AvidPay Network. Our indirect channel includes reseller partners and other strategic partnerships such as Mastercard, through MasterCard’s B2B Hub, which includes Fifth Third Bank and Bank of America, and other financial institutions, such as KeyBank,

and third-party software providers such as MRI Software, RealPage and SAP Concur. Our referral and indirect channel partnerships provide us greater reach across the market to access a variety of buyers.
 
Our Industry
 Our industry is a significant and growing market, which is defined by the following key factors and trends:
 •Legacy B2B Payments are complicated and inefficient. Unlike the world of consumer payments, B2B payments require a set of complex workflows, accounting system integrations and processes centered on the purchase order or invoice. These involve rigorous payment approval processes and a payment generally initiated from and integrated to various accounting systems. The labor and direct costs associated with these manual processes are expensive and time intensive, creating significant challenges and inefficiencies to those that are not able to digitize and automate these workflows.
 •Middle market businesses face unique challenges. Middle market businesses face unique challenges with respect to their AP processes. The middle market features hundreds of accounting systems and integrations that support various vertical and sub-industries, resulting in a multitude of complex and highly specific business, accounting and compliance requirements. Furthermore, costs related to these complex AP workflows are a significant component of middle market companies’ administrative expenses. These businesses are increasingly required to turn to automated cloud-based AP automation and B2B payment solutions to unlock substantial cost savings and create more operational efficiencies within their organizations.
 •Middle market businesses and their suppliers are largely ignored by existing solutions. We believe middle market businesses and their suppliers are vastly underserved by existing financial software solutions. While a few key providers serve each of the larger enterprise buyers and the SMB buyers segments, middle market businesses are largely served by a highly fragmented market of vertical focused ERP and software solutions. This fragmentation has led to hundreds of accounting systems available in the middle market today. Additionally, we believe that close to half of the market representing suppliers of our buyers is currently underserved by available offerings.
 •Generational shift in technology adoption. As the next generation of accounting and finance leaders hail from an era of digital consumer finance transformation, there will be an increasing demand for digitization, data and technological efficiency added to standard business workflows. Furthermore, the growing importance of data requires businesses to adopt platforms that provide real-time visibility, analytics and insights to allow better, more informed decision making. This next generation of leaders are driving the demand for technological advances in their companies and leading the outreach for solutions such as AvidXchange.
 The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and, in some cases, accelerated the need for dynamic, cloud-based solutions that are able to be utilized anytime and anywhere. The critical need for business continuity was even more pronounced during the shift to remote work environments and through the U.S. mail disruption. Businesses need to be able to receive invoices, pay bills and seamlessly run their businesses no matter what external factors may occur. Digital solutions offer a more secure, reliable, and flexible solution to legacy manual processes.
 Our Market Opportunity
 The B2B payments market is rapidly evolving and represents a significant opportunity for digital transformation. Despite their intrinsic process inefficiencies and high costs, paper checks still comprise 42% of all B2B payments in the United States. In response to this large volume of inefficient processes, the market is undergoing a transformation.
 We believe these market inefficiencies and current trends present a large and growing opportunity for our business.


In addition to providing B2B payments, we believe we can become a strategic cornerstone of our suppliers’ finance organizations to better manage expenses and cash flow. We believe that there is a large unmet need in supplier invoice finance, with close to half of the market underserved. Our solutions help suppliers accelerate invoices for early payment, manage supplier payment preferences, and forecast future cash flows.


Go-To-Market
 We have made significant investments in our sales and marketing organization, and we employ a hybrid go-to-market strategy utilizing both direct and indirect channels. Our go-to-market organization consists of employees supporting buyers and suppliers in our direct sales, marketing and relationship management teams and is a cornerstone of creating and maintaining trusted customer relationships.
We sell our solutions to buyers through both a direct sales force and indirectly through strategic channel partnerships with banks and financial institutions as well as software and technology business partners. We attract suppliers to the AvidPay Network by establishing a simple, easy-to-use network that helps integrate various buyers through a standard invoice and pay network.
 
Our go-to-market team is core to our growth and continues to evolve with the rapidly evolving market and our own internal development of products. We continuously monitor key metrics that measure our sales team and channel sales success, productivity, and efficiency. We maintain long-term customer satisfaction through our relationship management and customer care organization, who provide customer support through multiple avenues of communication including email, phone, chat, and forums.
 Our marketing is focused on our unique ability to serve the middle market, our easy to integrate solutions, the value we provide to our customers, and our continued product innovation. Our targeted marketing to the middle market includes both digital and traditional brand campaigns, targeted advertisements, social, thought leadership pieces, trade shows, and webinars.
 We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities to capitalize on our market opportunity.
 Why We Win
 Our customers choose us for the tangible value proposition our solutions offer. We believe we have several competitive advantages that drive our ability to leverage our first mover market position:
 •Built to solve the unique business challenges of the middle market. Since our inception, our solution has been purpose-built for the middle market. Our platform addresses enterprise level challenges, but at the scale, price and in the language of the middle market.
 •Digitize the entire AP workflow. We apply data and SaaS-based software automation to the entirety of the AP workflow. While some tools require the buyer to first handle invoice ingestion, we focus on transforming the buyer experience by owning, and enhancing, each point of the value chain. Our platform will handle invoice ingestion, whether through paper or electronic means, and replicate that ownership and automation through to payment.
 •Comprehensive, end-to-end AP Automation and payments platform. Our comprehensive solution provides a single-vendor approach to eliminate paper, streamline workflows and ensure timely and accurate reconciliation. We have spent years building a software and payments platform coupled with hundreds of integrations to vertical-specific middle market accounting and information systems. We believe this provides us with a unique competitive advantage to automate AP workflows, streamline invoice payment and continue to grow our two-sided network.
 •Scaled, two-sided network of buyers and suppliers powers a flywheel effect. We provide the infrastructure layer connecting our buyers with their suppliers. As buyers approve and pay more invoices through our platform, we connect them to their suppliers and add more suppliers to our network, which drives an expansion of the flywheel effect that fuels our growth. As a result of this ongoing flywheel, we have built a high level of supplier density that allows us to monetize payments almost immediately after a buyer joins our platform.
 •Diverse and deep integration layer. We offer more than 220 integrations with different accounting systems that allow our clients to curate a technology stack tailored to the nuances of their size, scale and vertical. Our “built inside” integrations, many of which are flexible Application Programming Interface ("API") based integrations, facilitate increasingly seamless exchanges of data, driving enhanced user experiences and utility and providing a feature set and level of customization historically reserved only for enterprises.


•Unparalleled data capabilities. Our buyers and suppliers benefit from the millions of invoices we have ingested and processed since inception. From the beginning, we recognized the feedback value of data and as such our product development and operations benefit from two decades of transactions. We believe we ingest invoices more accurately, manage risk more insightfully and assess credit more thoughtfully in part due to a knowledge base that continues to grow every day.
 •“Win as a team” culture. Our culture is our DNA. It’s what brings us together and makes us who we are. We believe our culture gives us a unique competitive advantage. Our strength lies in leveraging the unique differences our employees bring to the workplace. We value diverse talents, skills, ideas, ways of thinking, backgrounds and life stories – all of which drive our innovation and performance. As entrepreneurs seeking innovative solutions to serve our customers, we want every employee to feel a strong sense of purpose and belonging. Therefore, we strive to create a workplace where every employee feels comfortable and empowered to bring their full, authentic self to work every day. As we continue to grow the business, we also intentionally focus on the key drivers of employee experience and engagement: wellbeing, growth and development, and rewards and recognition. Engaged employees are imperative to achieve strong company performance and excellent customer experience.
 Growth Strategy
 We are dedicated to continuing to differentiate ourselves as the leader in AP automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses through our multi-pronged approach. Fundamentally, the growth of our business is dependent upon the number of transactions we process, as well as our total payment volume. Key elements of our growth strategy include the following.
 •Win new buyers and their suppliers. We believe the middle market opportunity remains largely underpenetrated. As the number of middle market companies continues to increase and their AP and payment complexity grows, we anticipate demand for our products by new customers to increase. We will continue to invest heavily in our direct and indirect sales channels to increase awareness of our platform, drive sales opportunities, and convert more of our pipeline into customers. We will also continue to grow and scale the number of strategic partnerships we have, providing more opportunities to acquire new customers from our software and bank channels as well as our referral partnerships.
 •Grow with existing buyers and suppliers. We expect to continue to grow with our existing buyer base of over 8,000 businesses. As our buyer base continues to grow and mature, we expect them to continue to increase invoice and payment transaction volume across the AvidXchange platform. In addition, we plan to continue to cross-sell solutions to our existing buyers.
 •Increase conversion of paper checks to electronic payments. As our buyers continue to mature and increase their overall payment transaction volume, we believe there is significant opportunity to increase the penetration of electronic payments. The reliance on highly manual invoice management processes and paper check-based payments results in wasted time and money that serve as great candidates for automation. As additional buyers and suppliers join our proprietary AvidPay Network, we will continue to build functionality and drive conversion of manual to electronic payments. Our growing supplier density will continue to drive higher monetization rates leading to increased e-payment adoption.
 •Continue to innovate and enhance new products. We will continue leveraging the rich data and business insights we have accumulated across buyer and supplier transactions to add new innovations and capabilities. We will continue to expand horizontal product functionality to benefit our clients. Key areas of continued product innovation include creating products to support larger buyers that require more advanced procurement and spend management capabilities, growing functionality within the AvidPay Network, focusing on our operational scalability to enhance our ability to effectively manage critical transactions, and increasing automation across our platform. Our goal is to create more end-to-end solutions that integrate purchasing and payments workflows. In addition to enhancing products for our buyer customers, we will also continue to use our access to rich data to build out more robust offerings for suppliers, including financing solutions to serve the significant opportunity there. 
 •Selectively pursue strategic M&A. We will supplement our organic growth by pursuing strategic M&A to expand into new verticals and horizontal capabilities, capture unmonetized or under-monetized spend, and enhance and expand products and capabilities. We have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and executing M&A to drive revenue growth, efficiency leverage, and scalability across the organization.
 •Enter new verticals. We believe there is significant untapped opportunity in the middle market to expand into new and adjacent verticals. We will continue to invest in our vertical sales teams across different geographies to execute in-house development to build vertical domain capabilities, increase our number of bank and software partnerships, and expand the number of next-generation API and “built inside” integrations. We plan to do this both organically and 


through potential acquisitions. We recently expanded into the Education sector and our recent acquisition of Core Associates enabled us to become one of the leading AP providers in the construction market.
 •International expansion. We plan on expanding internationally in the near to mid-term with an initial focus on Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe. We intend to leverage our existing business partner relationships we have already in place in the United States to begin building our presence worldwide. 
 Human Capital, Culture, Social Responsibility and Community Initiatives
 At AvidXchange, our employees are the core of who we are. We’re all entrepreneurs who love to innovate and win with a passion for serving our customers. We take personal ownership of our everyday work, and we recognize that we only win as a team. While we’re proud to stand out, we also know that to shine brightly as a company, the light we create needs to build from the inside out – from person to person, and team to team.
 While we are a technology company by trade, at our core, we are a people company, and that means not only taking care of each other, but those in the communities in which we work and live. In 2005, we formed the AvidXchange Foundation. Initially, we set out to help elementary school children impacted by Hurricane Katrina. From then on, the AvidXchange Foundation has been dedicated to making a difference in the lives of young people where we work and live.
 As a technology company, we have a responsibility to give back to the community the best way we know. For AvidXchange, that means finding solutions to problems through a technology lens to empower future generations to be well equipped to partake in today’s digital economy, which will be even more critical tomorrow. We recognize that barriers to technology education and careers start early in a student’s life with having access to the right resources throughout their education, which is why we launched Tech Rising – an initiative spearheaded by the AvidXchange Foundation committed to removing technology barriers and bridging the digital divide to create economic mobility for youth and young adults.
 But we don’t limit our efforts or those of our employees to a singular mission. Corporate giving of all kinds is a part of AvidXchange’s DNA, and we enable employees who are passionate about giving back to the community – however is most meaningful to them – with paid volunteer time off. We understand that engaging with our communities and striving to improve the quality of life for our employees and neighbors is more than an opportunity – it’s our responsibility.
 We are committed to sharing our resources and time in support of philanthropic efforts. In demonstration of this commitment, on June 24, 2021, our board of directors approved the reservation of 1,657,296 shares of our common stock (representing approximately 1% of our issued and outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents as of June 24, 2021) for future issuance to fund our philanthropic endeavors, including possible issuance to a philanthropic partner in connection with the establishment of a donor-advised fund, over a ten-year period. On October 1, 2021, we executed an agreement with a philanthropic partner and issued the first contribution of 10% of the pledged shares on October 15, 2021. We intend to provide annual ongoing grants of 10% of the pledged shares for a period of nine subsequent years, subject in each case to the approval of our board of directors.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had over 1,600 full-time, U.S. based employees. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Competition
 We believe the overall market for AP software and payments solutions is highly fragmented, competitive and evolving and is marked by rapid change and consolidation due to technological innovations and continued adoption by businesses. Although we expect businesses to continue to adopt AP and payment automation solutions, we often find that we are selling our products and services to potential customers that have use a variety of separate solutions or internally developed policies and procedures, and we must be able to convince internal stakeholders that our products and solutions are superior to their existing processes or third-party solutions.
 Our current competitors range from fintech companies, such as Bill.com and Coupa Software, and financial institutions to smaller, niche providers of software and services, as well as point solutions provided by ERP vendors. We compete with companies that offer comprehensive solutions focused on the entire AP and payment processes and companies that focus only on select portions of these processes such as invoice and bill presentment, document and workflow management, AP and payment processing or accounts receivable. Solutions are also often specifically tailored to industry vertical or customer size making it difficult to expand into new verticals or attract larger or smaller customer types.
 Accounting and ERP software providers, financial institutions, payment processing, and other service providers, a number of which we partner with in offering our solutions, may currently offer or develop solutions, acquire third-party solutions or competitors, or enter into strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their solutions to compete more effectively with our products and services. These parties may have access to larger, installed customer bases and may be able to effectively

bundle and cross sell competitive solutions with their other services, which may enable them to compete more effectively or provide them with greater pricing and operating flexibility.
 Companies that currently focus on providing solutions to enterprise businesses or SMBs may seek to expand the offering of their solutions to midmarket customers which would be more directly competitive with the products and services that we offer. New entrants not currently considered to be competitors may also enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships.
 We currently compete on several factors, including:
 •product and service features, functionality and quality and system stability;
 •integrations with leading accounting and banking systems;
 •our value added services provided through various strategic partnership;
 •pricing and incentives;
 •supplier network;
 •ability to automate existing processes; and
 •customer onboarding time and effort.
 
We believe that we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. We expect the middle market AP software and B2B payment solutions market to continue to evolve and grow, as greater numbers of middle market and larger businesses digitize their back offices. We believe that we are well-positioned to help them.
 Regulatory Environment
 We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied or new laws and regulations are implemented in this environment is often unclear and unpredictable, in particular as such laws and regulations relate to our business in the United States and internationally to the extent we might in the future elect to expand our services outside the United States.
 Most states and certain territories in the United States require a license to engage in certain money transmission or payment services. We have procured and maintain money transmitter licenses, or the statutory equivalent, in all of the U.S. jurisdictions that currently require them for our business and actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. These licenses enable us to provide commercial payment services to businesses through AvidXchange, Inc. “for the benefit of customer” bank accounts that are restricted for such purposes and subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and examination by state regulatory agencies.
 We are also registered as a Money Services Business with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, and are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA"), and certain obligations contained therein, including, among other things, certain record-keeping and reporting requirements, and examinations by FinCEN.
 The BSA is the primary compendium of U.S. laws and regulations regarding anti-money laundering ("AML") and countering the financing of terrorism. As required under the BSA, we have implemented and are continuing to expand an AML program designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Our program is also designed to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries, or with certain persons or entities, which are targets of economic or trade sanctions that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the "OFAC") and various foreign authorities administer or enforce. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, require the designation of a BSA and AML compliance officer to oversee the programs, and are designed to address our legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with sanctions, compliance, money laundering, and terrorist financing.
 Although we do not provide consumer services or products, we do collect and use a wide variety of information for various purposes in our business, including to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. Our customers’ data is stored in our platform, and we must monitor and, as applicable, comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations regarding the data stored and processed on our platform as well as the operation of our business. This may present legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy or intellectual property rights related to the content loaded onto our platform.


This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of the information we acquire in connection with our customers’ use of our services, may be subject to certain laws and regulations in the United States. In particular, data privacy and security with respect to the collection, processing, and retention of personal data or Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") continues to be the focus of legislation and regulation. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the unauthorized use and disclosure of individuals’ PII. Many U.S. states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of PII to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. Federal laws are also under consideration that may create additional compliance obligations and penalties. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information.
 In addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including within the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that are more restrictive than those in the United States. While we believe that the products and services that we currently offer in the United States do not subject us to such laws or regulations in foreign jurisdictions, such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, new laws and regulations may be enacted, or we may modify or expand our products or services in the future, or acquire a company operating internationally, which may subject us to such laws and regulations.
 Data privacy and security with respect to the collection, processing, and retention of PII continues to be the focus of domestic and worldwide legislation and regulation. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the unauthorized use and disclosure of individuals’ PII. Many U.S. states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. Federal laws are also under consideration that may create additional compliance obligations and penalties.
 Various regulatory agencies in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which may be applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing. As our business continues to develop and expand, we continue to monitor the additional rules and regulations that may become relevant or applicable to our business.
 Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of privacy and data use, under the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
 Intellectual Property
 We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying upon a combination of contractual measures as well as trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws.
 We rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive position. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 39 trademark applications and registrations for certain of our logos. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We also own several domain names, including www.avidxchange.com.
 Patents have not historically been a significant part of our intellectual property strategy. We may however pursue patent protection in the future to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
 From time to time we may also use or incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open-source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed.
 Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.


We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third parties may also claim that our solutions infringe upon their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are large and established and have greater resources than we do. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. Moreover, our products may incorporate software components licensed to the general public under open-source software licenses. Open-source licenses may grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify, and redistribute our platform. As a result, open-source development and license practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets.
 For additional information about our intellectual property and associated risks, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
