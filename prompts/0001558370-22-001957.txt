ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview 
We are innovating genetic medicines to provide durable, redosable treatments for potentially hundreds of millions of patients living with rare and prevalent diseases. Our non-viral genetic medicine platform incorporates our high-capacity DNA construct called closed-ended DNA, or ceDNA; our cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery system, or ctLNP; and our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses our proprietary cell-free rapid enzymatic synthesis, or RES, to produce ceDNA. Using our platform, we are developing novel genetic medicines to provide targeted delivery of genetic payloads that include large and multiple genes to a range of cell types across a broad array of diseases. We are also engineering our genetic medicines to be redosable, which may enable individualized patient titration to reach the desired level of therapeutic expression and to maintain efficacy throughout a patient’s life. 
We are advancing a broad and expansive portfolio of programs, including programs for rare and prevalent diseases of the liver and retina. We are focused on diseases with significant unmet need for which our non-viral genetic medicine platform may substantially improve clinical efficacy relative to current gene therapy approaches. We are initially prioritizing rare monogenic diseases of the liver and retina, which are diseases that result from mutations in a single gene, that have well-established biomarkers and clear clinical and regulatory pathways.
In addition, we believe that our non-viral genetic medicine platform may be used to develop therapies that deliver antibody genes to direct the liver to produce antibody therapies for patients’ own cells for years at a time from a single dose in a process we refer to as endogenous therapeutic antibody production, or ETAP. We plan to advance ETAP programs across multiple therapeutic areas, including prevalent indications.
We also believe that our platform may be used to develop other therapeutic modalities and are exploring ways to apply our platform technologies. For example, we are conducting early research into the development of potential messenger RNA-, or mRNA, based vaccines and ceDNA-based vaccines, in each case, using our proprietary vaccine-optimized ctLNPs. We believe mRNA-ctLNP and ceDNA-ctLNP vaccines could meet or exceed the benchmark for efficacy and duration of current mRNA-LNP vaccines in use. In particular, we believe ceDNA-ctLNP vaccines could enable more durable protection, and could be stored at ambient temperatures potentially allowing for greater shelf stability than currently approved mRNA-LNP vaccines, which currently must be stored at very low temperatures, limiting distribution. 
Furthermore, we plan to expand our portfolio to include rare and prevalent diseases of the skeletal muscle, the central nervous system, or CNS, and oncology by developing discrete ctLNPs, each engineered to reach a different tissue. 
While we are currently a preclinical stage company and are early in our development efforts, we believe that our non-viral genetic medicines have the potential to reach previously untreatable or under-treated patients and address new indications, including those with large patient populations, thereby unlocking the full potential of genetic medicine. Specifically, we believe that our non-viral genetic medicines have the potential to provide durable and redosable therapies that will enable:
●expanded patient access, including the ability to treat children;
●delivery of large genetic payload, including large and multiple genes;
●native gene regulation;
●targeted delivery to a range of cell types;
●large-scale cost-effective production;
●treatment for hundreds of millions of patients across the globe; and

●a sustainable payer model.

Our non-viral genetic medicine platform
Our non-viral genetic medicine platform is comprised of three essential component technologies: our high-capacity ceDNA construct, which can accommodate large or multiple genes as well as native regulatory elements; our ctLNP delivery system, which enables highly specific delivery of ceDNA to a range of cell types; and our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses our proprietary cell-free RES to produce ceDNA. We believe our platform technologies have the potential to enable genetic medicines to reach patients with rare diseases and to expand access to patients with prevalent diseases, requiring hundreds of millions of doses, on a sustainable basis.
ceDNA
Our high-capacity ceDNA is an engineered, double-stranded, linear, covalently closed-ended DNA construct that includes the gene of interest and associated regulatory sequences. We have produced ceDNA constructs of 8 kilobases, or kb, using RES, which have almost two times the 4.7 kb capacity of adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy approaches. We believe our ceDNA constructs can deliver a significant majority of the human coding sequences known to be relevant for the treatment of diseases that result from mutations in a single gene or in multiple genes. ceDNA may address many diseases, including prevalent diseases and diseases requiring more than one type of genetic correction that are beyond the scope of current gene therapy. This capacity can also accommodate native or engineered regulatory elements, potentially enabling a powerful new dimension of genetic medicine that responds to the body’s own signals.
ctLNP
Our ctLNP delivery system builds upon clinically validated lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, and is designed to allow for repeat dosing of a genetic payload without stimulating an immune response, such as antibody production. We have taken a significant step beyond current LNP technology by engineering LNP compositions that provide selective uptake to desired cell types. Different compositions may enable our ctLNPs to target specific cell receptors in the liver, retina, immune system, skeletal muscle, CNS and tumors. In addition, our ctLNP delivery system may confer the advantages of predictable behavior across species, minimal off-target effects and a foundational platform approach that unlocks the ability to target the widest possible spectrum of diseases with our therapies.
ceDNA Manufacturing process
Our highly scalable manufacturing process uses our proprietary cell-free RES to produce ceDNA. Our novel, next-generation process does not rely on Sf9 cells to manufacture ceDNA. Instead, RES uses enzymes to convert plasmid DNA and synthetic oligonucleotides into ceDNA, similar to the current high-capacity methods used to manufacture mRNA vaccines. RES produces ceDNA that is comparable to the ceDNA we produced from Sf9 cells, but RES and our rigorous, industrial-scale purification process has consistently yielded highly pure ceDNA. RES also has increased production yield and efficiency such that our ceDNA production cycle time has been reduced from 28 days to one day. 

In July 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Zinc II PropCo 2020, LLC to build out an approximately 104,000 square foot current Good Manufacturing Practice-, or cGMP-, compliant manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. The facility, expected to be operational in 2023, is intended for ceDNA manufacturing utilizing RES for drug substance manufacturing and ctLNP production resulting in cGMP-compliant clinical and initial commercial supply. In addition, the new facility is designed to provide expanded capacity for research production and process development activities. We plan to invest up to $45 million in the build-out of the new manufacturing facility over the next two years. We plan to continue to rely on contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, during and after construction to provide redundancy and secure additional ceDNA supply.
We believe our platform technologies, with the expected multi-year durability of a single dose of ceDNA, targeted delivery and manufacturing capacity, may enable us to provide dosing for hundreds of millions of patients living with prevalent diseases. We also believe these features will allow the cost of production for our non-viral genetic medicine platform to compare favorably to the cost of production of current biologic products.

Our portfolio
We are advancing a broad and expansive portfolio of programs, including programs for rare and prevalent diseases of the liver and retina. We are focused on diseases with significant unmet need for which our non-viral genetic medicine platform may substantially improve clinical efficacy relative to current genetic medicine approaches. We are initially prioritizing rare monogenic diseases of the liver and retina that have well-established biomarkers and clear clinical and regulatory pathways.
We are developing our constructs, delivery system, and manufacturing capacity to rapidly advance new disease programs in a tissue or therapeutic area once human proof of concept is established. As shown in the figure below, our most advanced liver disease program is in hemophilia A, which is in the preclinical stage of development, and our most advanced retina disease programs are in Stargardt disease and Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis, or LCA10, which are in the lead optimization stage of development. Additional programs in the liver, including phenylketonuria, or PKU, Wilson disease and Gaucher, are in the lead optimization stage of development. Our ETAP program in the liver and wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, program in the retina are in the research stage. We are also conducting early research into the development of potential mRNA-ctLNP and ceDNA-ctLNP vaccines. We plan to expand our portfolio to include rare and prevalent diseases of the skeletal muscle, the CNS and oncology by developing discrete ctLNPs, each engineered to reach a different tissue or therapeutic area. In the lead optimization stage, we are seeking to identify ceDNA constructs that provide disease relevant expression in an animal model, and in the preclinical stage of development, we are conducting additional in vivo studies to identify development candidates and are assessing these candidates in investigational new drug, or IND, -enabling studies.

Our programs in the liver and retina as well as in our expansion opportunities and early research are wholly owned by us. For the majority of our programs, we have designed and produced ceDNAs that have shown expression in vitro and/or disease correction in vivo.
Our strategy
Our goal is to become an industry leader in the field of genetic medicines, advancing our non-viral genetic medicine platform to discover, develop, manufacture and globally commercialize genetic medicine that is durable, redosable and specifically delivered to a range of cell types for the treatment of diseases caused by single, large or multiple gene defects. We aim to provide sustainable, life-long treatment for hundreds of millions of patients living with rare and prevalent diseases.

Our research and development efforts have resulted in numerous innovations and breakthroughs across every aspect of our platform. We own or exclusively license patent applications in 48 patent application families covering our programs and technology, including our ceDNA platform, ctLNP delivery system and our RES manufacturing process, and have taken other steps to protect our proprietary position with respect to these innovations and breakthroughs. Our wholly owned intellectual property, combined with the background technology we have licensed from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMass, and Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., or Voyager, based on our co-founder’s prior work, supports the leading position of our non-viral genetic medicine platform and provides a strong foundation for its continued advancement.
The genetic medicines industry 
Background
The human genome is made up of approximately 25,000 genes, which act as a set of instructions to influence and determine every aspect of how the body functions. A genetic disease is caused by a change, or a mutation, in an individual’s DNA sequence. Genetic diseases can be caused by a mutation in a single gene, known as a monogenic disorder, or by mutations in multiple genes, known as a multifactorial inheritance disorder. Current estimates suggest that there are more than 10,000 monogenic diseases. Many of these are rare, affecting hundreds or thousands of patients worldwide, such as hemophilia A or PKU. There are an even greater number of prevalent diseases whose genetics are multifactorial, affecting millions of people on a global scale, such as many types of metabolic disease and cancer.
Genetic medicines are designed to correct disease-causing dysfunction at the genetic level and utilize recombinant nucleic acids to regulate, repair, replace, add or delete a genetic sequence to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Viral gene therapy, gene editing and mRNA are genetic medicine modalities that specifically aim to replace the function of disease-causing genes by either inserting a gene, modifying the DNA, or inserting mRNA into a patient’s cell.
Early gene therapy clinical trials in the 1990’s used adenovirus to deliver genetic material. However, developers have moved away from using adenoviruses because they can trigger a strong immune reaction and their effect is short lived. Another form of viral gene therapy uses retroviral vectors, including lentiviral vectors, to incorporate DNA directly into a cell’s chromosome upon infection, typically through ex vivo delivery. In ex vivo delivery, genetic modification of isolated patient or donor cells are conducted outside of the patient and then re-introduced to the patient. As an integrating virus, these vectors pose additional safety risks, and create the potential for disrupting genes or activating cancer-causing genes. In addition, ex vivo delivery poses a significant operational challenge and higher cost relative to in vivo therapies. As a result, AAV has become a preferred viral vector for gene therapy.
Significant progress has been made in the field of genetic medicine over the last decade with products approved in viral gene therapy and mRNA programs, and several gene editing programs in clinical development. While we expect that there will be further advancements in these modalities, each possesses distinct clinical and commercial limitations due to known safety, efficacy, therapeutic delivery and manufacturing scale challenges.
Current and emerging genetic medicines and their limitations
Viral gene therapy
Viral gene therapy, in which viral vectors are employed to deliver therapeutic genes to defective cells or tissues, has made significant progress in the past decade. The most advanced system for systemic administration is AAV gene therapy, which has demonstrated durable transduction of cells in several organ systems, with long-lasting expression in non-dividing cells. Several AAV gene therapy products have been approved, including LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) for the treatment of the rare inherited blindness disorder biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy and ZOLGENSMA (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) for spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA.

10



However, current AAV gene therapy has demonstrated limitations, including:

● | Single dose administration only: Following a single dose of AAV, antibodies are induced against the AAV capsid, the protein shell of the virus used for delivery. Because of these antibodies, AAV can only be dosed once, and it is typically dosed at the upper end of its therapeutic index to maximize potential efficacy across all treated patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Variable expression: Administration of a single fixed dose to all patients prevents repeat dosing to adjust the expression level in each patient, called titration, and leads to variable levels of expression, with many patients expressing the therapeutic protein above or below target levels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inefficient clinical development: Because patients cannot be redosed, those who do not achieve a therapeutic effect in early clinical trials cannot benefit from AAV therapy or contribute to further clinical development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inability to extend expression: The antibodies formed following a single dose of AAV prevent re-treatment to increase or extend efficacy for patients with inadequate initial response or declining levels of expression.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exclusion of pediatric patients: The inability to redose limits the treatment of pediatric patients, whose organ growth and dividing cells would dilute expression over time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pre-existing immunity: Up to half of patients have antibodies against AAV due to naturally acquired infections. These antibodies prevent them from receiving AAV gene therapy due to pre-existing AAV immunity to the capsid.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payload capacity: AAV constructs are limited to 4.7 kb in length, restricting both the size of genes and complexity of regulatory sequences that can be delivered. This restricts the diseases that can be addressed to those requiring single genes that can fit within this limited capacity and prevents the use of native regulatory sequences that may respond to the body’s own signals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Off-target, multi-tissue delivery: Due to the inherent features of AAV, off-target delivery to unintended tissues and cell types can lead to adverse events.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality control: A lack of process and analytic control over the composition of AAV vectors leads to batch-to-batch variation in potency and potentially contributes to inconsistency in patients’ responses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacturing scale: The production systems for AAV gene therapies are limited in scale to 2,000 liters per batch or less. In general, the high doses required by AAV gene therapies and the low productivity of these systems combine to limit treatment to rare disease populations at a higher cost relative to other treatment modalities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payer coverage: The relatively high cost of AAV gene therapies, combined with uncertain clinical durability and the inability to redose to extend expression, make it challenging for payers to predict clinical outcomes and, as a result, payers may be less inclined to pay for AAV gene therapies within the current reimbursement paradigm.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gene editing
Gene editing is the process of deleting, modifying or replacing defective DNA directly in the native genomic location. Zinc finger nuclease, TALEN and CRISPR-based gene editing are the most advanced approaches to gene editing and are currently in early clinical trials. CRISPR uses a combination of a nuclease to make a double-stranded break in the DNA and a guide RNA, or gRNA, to direct the nuclease to the correct location for editing. Given insertion of full-length genes into the chromosome has remained relatively inefficient for gene editing, particularly in vivo, these approaches have primarily focused on ex vivo therapeutic applications.
Moreover, viral vectors are used widely to deliver gene editing nucleases in vivo, thereby conveying many of the same clinical and commercial challenges as viral gene therapy. Additional limitations for gene editing include the potential for unwanted DNA modifications related to off-target double-stranded DNA breaks, and the inability to control the level of 

11



protein expression through titration and low efficiency of gene correction due to limitations of functional delivery of one-dose AAV. Finally, a significant limitation of AAV is the size of genes that can be delivered for whole-gene insertion, something that our non-viral platform seeks to address.
​
Messenger RNA therapies
Messenger RNA therapies are designed to increase mRNA levels by exogenous delivery of modified mRNA. However, the use of modified mRNA is limited by a lack of durable expression due to the half-life, or stability profile, of an mRNA transcript in the cell, which is approximately 10 hours. Due to the lack of durable expression for mRNA and the resulting requirement of frequent dosing, clinical development of mRNA therapies has focused primarily on novel vaccines. In addition, the standard LNP approaches used for mRNA do not enable precise targeting of tissues.
Summary of limitations of current approaches
The advancements in gene therapy have demonstrated the potential of these modalities to replace full genes and the aggregate market capitalization of publicly traded gene therapy companies in the United States exceeds $50 billion. However, as illustrated in the figure below, the current approaches also have important limitations. While the development of our non-viral genetic medicine platform is still in the early stage and we have not yet identified a product candidate, and thus contrasts with other approaches may not be a direct comparison, we have designed our platform to overcome the limitations of these genetic medicine approaches.
Comparison of genetic medicine approaches
Advantages of our non-viral genetic medicine platform 
Our non-viral genetic medicine platform, comprised of our ceDNA construct, our ctLNP delivery system and our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process using our proprietary cell-free RES to produce ceDNA, is designed to overcome the limitations of current genetic medicine approaches and we believe will disrupt the field of genetic medicine. We believe that our platform technologies may provide the following advantages:

● | Durable expression: Our ceDNA is highly stable and establishes extra-chromosomal episomes in the nucleus of cells to drive durable expression of the gene of interest. This durability has the potential to enable years-long expression for patients with each dose, minimizing the treatment burden for patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | Redosable administration: Our ctLNP system has been designed to avoid stimulating an antibody response in patients, thereby enabling redosing. The ability to redose provides several advantages:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Individualized patient titration to reach desired expression level: We expect our genetic medicines will enable individualized patient titration, allowing each patient to be redosed until they reach the expression level required to address their specific needs. Patients and physicians may achieve individual therapeutic goals in a predictable manner.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Greater opportunity to demonstrate efficacy in first-in-human trials: Because we may be able to redose, we expect that a greater proportion of patients participating in our early clinical trials may achieve the desired level of gene expression.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extending expression: If expression of the gene of interest begins to wane for an individual patient, we expect that redosing could restore effective expression levels, prolonging the benefits of our therapies throughout the patient’s life.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reach pediatric patients: Rapidly waning expression due to organ growth and dividing cells in children limits the utility of a single administration of gene therapy. We expect that the properties of our medicines may allow us to initiate treatment in childhood and allow the patient to prolong the benefits thereafter. Early intervention near the onset of disease may enable a greater therapeutic benefit throughout the patient’s life.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Address untreated or under-treated patients: Our medicines may be used to treat patients with pre-existing immunity to the AAV viral capsid, and therefore, not able to receive AAV gene therapy treatments, as well as patients whose efficacy outcomes on current gene therapy were insufficient in level or duration of expression.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delivery of large genetic payloads: The large payload capacity of ceDNA enables our constructs to carry large genes, multiple genes or combinations of genes with regulatory elements. This capacity arises from the lack of capsid packaging constraints that limit DNA incorporation in AAV gene therapy to less than 4.7 kb. Our highly scalable manufacturing process using RES to produce ceDNA routinely prepares constructs of up to 8 kb in length without loss in yield or quality. We have not identified an upper limit of construct length.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More potent constructs: Our ceDNA constructs have the potential to improve upon existing genetic medicine modalities by utilizing novel expression elements that exceed the capacity of AAV gene therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Larger genes: Our ceDNA constructs may enable treatment of monogenic diseases requiring larger genes that are not possible to deliver with current genetic medicines.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multiple genes: Our ceDNA constructs have the potential to include novel multi-gene constructs to produce complex biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, or to address conditions that need more than one type of genetic correction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Native gene regulation: The large capacity of our constructs provides us the ability to incorporate native regulatory elements that are naturally associated with the gene we are replacing. We believe this will allow for activity of the replaced gene to increase or decrease in response to the body’s own signals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Targeted, multi-cell delivery: We have designed our ctLNP delivery system to include compositions that provide selective uptake to desired cell types. We believe that highly specific targeting to the key cell type for therapeutic benefit with limited delivery to off-target cells will improve the safety profile of our products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential expansion to reach hundreds of millions of patients: We aim to provide dosing for hundreds of millions of patients living with prevalent diseases through the combination of our platform technologies with the expected multi-year durability of a single dose of ceDNA, targeted delivery and our manufacturing capacity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




● | Sustainable payer model: Our cost-effective manufacturing process using RES, combined with the potential to redose patients to extend expression, may allow payers to better predict clinical outcomes and, as a result, to cover our medicines within the current reimbursement paradigm.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that our genetic medicine has the potential to reach previously untreatable or under-treated patients and address new indications, including those with large patient populations, thereby unlocking the full potential of genetic medicine.
Our strategy 
Our goal is to become an industry leader in the field of genetic medicine, advancing our non-viral genetic medicine platform to discover, develop, manufacture and globally commercialize genetic medicine that is durable, redosable and specifically delivered to a range of cell types for the treatment of diseases caused by single, large or multiple gene defects. We aim to provide sustainable, life-long treatment for hundreds of millions of patients living with rare and prevalent diseases.
Key components of our strategy include:

● | Establish ceDNA as a genetic medicine, initially demonstrating its potential across rare monogenic diseases of the liver and retina. We are prioritizing rare monogenic diseases of the liver and retina with significant unmet need for which our non-viral genetic medicine platform may substantially improve clinical efficacy relative to current gene therapy approaches, beginning with hemophilia A, PKU, LCA10 and Stargardt disease. We believe our initial focus on these rare indications, which have well-established biomarkers and clear clinical and regulatory pathways, may enable us to achieve more rapid human proof of concept, regulatory approval and eventually, commercialization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage our non-viral genetic medicine platform technologies to advance additional programs for diseases of the liver and retina and to expand quickly into additional cell types. We are advancing additional programs for the liver and retina by making minimal changes to our ceDNA construct and by using the same ctLNP delivery system for each cell type. We believe this process can reduce the risk and accelerate the speed of development for subsequent indications in these cell types. We also plan to apply this approach as we develop our ctLNP delivery system to reach skeletal muscle, the CNS and tumors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize our four-week research cycle to rapidly design, produce and screen ceDNA constructs to enable new disease programs within a tissue or therapeutic area. We have established a highly efficient four-week research cycle to rapidly design, produce and screen ceDNA constructs to enable new disease programs within a therapeutic area once human proof of concept is established in that area. We intend to invest in technologies to further accelerate our research cycle and create additional efficiency and scope for this process.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand internal manufacturing scale to access previously unattainable markets for genetic medicine. We developed RES, our novel, next-generation rapid enzymatic approach to manufacture ceDNA and, that does not rely on Sf9 cells. RES uses enzymes to convert plasmid and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides into ceDNA, similar to the current high-capacity methods used to manufacture mRNA vaccines. RES has consistently yielded highly pure ceDNA, reduced ceDNA variability, and shortened our ceDNA production cycle time from 28 days to one day. We expect that scaling RES may enable us to manufacture our potential drug candidates in a cost-effective manner and to expand access to patients with prevalent diseases, that require hundreds of millions of doses, on a sustainable basis and have transitioned all our portfolio programs to RES. To realize the full potential of RES, we intend to build out a cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility to scale ceDNA manufacturing utilizing RES for drug substance manufacturing and ctLNP production resulting in cGMP-compliant clinical and initial commercial supply.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand patient access to our non-viral genetic medicines through a high-value network of alliances and collaborations. We are developing a broad and expandable portfolio of genetic medicines that have the distinct opportunity to address rare monogenic diseases, as well as prevalent diseases. To help us realize the full breadth of opportunities and to expedite patient access to our genetic medicines, we have established and plan to continue to explore a limited set of innovative collaborations and strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies whose capabilities and resources are additive or complementary to our own. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Build upon the success of mRNA vaccines and explore the potential of DNA vaccines. We plan to leverage our ctLNP technology to build upon the success of mRNA vaccines and explore DNA vaccines to provide increased vaccine stability and a more robust memory response. We believe we can effectively use mRNA as a vaccine cargo to elicit high binding and neutralizing antibodies for a given antigen and ceDNA as a vaccine cargo may be used to improve cellular responses of immune cells and offer opportunities to create formulations stable at ambient temperatures, which could have implications for worldwide distribution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build a sustainable leadership position in non-viral genetic medicine as a fully integrated innovative biotechnology company. We have established a leading position in non-viral genetic medicine for gene transfer by investing in our ceDNA, ctLNP and manufacturing technologies and capabilities, and by rigorously protecting our innovations through an expanding intellectual property portfolio. We intend to evaluate and invest in new technologies that may further de-risk and accelerate the development of our genetic medicine, and to build out our capabilities to commercialize our genetic medicines on our own. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our non-viral genetic medicine platform 
Our non-viral genetic medicine platform is comprised of three essential components: our high-capacity ceDNA construct, which can accommodate large or multiple genes as well as native regulatory elements; our ctLNP delivery system, which enables highly specific delivery of ceDNA to a range of cell types; and our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses our proprietary cell-free RES, to produce ceDNA. We believe our platform technologies have the potential to enable genetic medicines to reach patients with rare diseases and to expand access to patients with prevalent diseases, requiring hundreds of millions of doses, on a sustainable basis.
The three components of our platform are designed to enable critical features that address key limitations of existing genetic medicines. Our ceDNA construct is designed to enable durable expression with a single dose. As shown in the figures below, in immunocompetent mice, a single intravenous dose of Sf9 produced ceDNA formulated in an LNP provided months-long expression in the liver using both the reporter protein luciferase (denoted in the left figure below as Luc ceDNA/LNP) and human Factor IX, or FIX, the protein that is missing or defective in hemophilia B (denoted in the right figure below as FIX ceDNA/LNP).
ceDNA-LNP: durable expression in immunocompetent mice after single IV administration
As shown in the figure below, Sf9 produced ceDNA delivered in an LNP could be redosed in mice with normal immune systems because the first dose did not induce neutralizing antibodies. As the figure demonstrates, in immunocompetent mice, redosing ceDNA formulated in an LNP achieved increased expression using both reporter protein luciferase (denoted 

15



in the left figure below as Luc ceDNA/LNP) and human FIX (denoted in the right figure below as FIX ceDNA/LNP). In both studies, we intravenously administered Sf9 produced ceDNA formulated in an LNP and then repeated the administration five weeks later. After the first administration of Luc ceDNA/LNP, mice demonstrated stable expression of luciferase protein and then higher, stable expression after repeat administration. After the first administration of FIX ceDNA/LNP, mice demonstrated 5-10% activity levels of FIX protein in the blood and then 10-20% activity after repeat administration. These results support our belief that our ceDNA platform may enable us to titrate every patient to the desired level of protein expression.
ceDNA-LNP: redosing achieves increased expression in immunocompetent mice
Closed-ended DNA (ceDNA) construct
ceDNA was discovered by our scientific co-founder Robert Kotin, who during his two decades as a senior investigator at the NIH also invented the Sf9 AAV production system and discovered the insertion site for AAV on chromosome 19. We have continued to build upon Dr. Kotin’s work by assembling an expert team of leaders in molecular biology in order to deepen our understanding of ceDNA biology. In addition, we are expanding on Dr. Kotin’s early work to create a broad palette of structural and sequence motifs for ceDNA constructs to explore novel mechanisms and to address multiple diseases. We are also deepening our expertise in computational biology, virology and cell biology to exploit the potential of large genomic datasets to elucidate the mechanisms underlying large subsets of prevalent and complex diseases.
ceDNA is an engineered, double-stranded, linear, covalently closed-ended DNA construct, with no free ends or viral capsid. As shown in the figure below, ceDNA includes the target gene or genes of interest, along with key components of the expression cassette, which is the full genetic sequence necessary to derive transcription including spacers, promoters and untranslated regions flanked by two inverted terminal repeat, or ITR, sequences. By gene of interest, we specifically mean the transcribed region of the target gene. ITRs, which are also present in AAV technology, are thought to be critical for durable expression in the nucleus of cells. To date, we have designed, produced and purified ceDNA constructs of up to 8 kb using RES without loss in yield or quality, and have not identified an upper limit of construct length.

Nuclear entry
In an AAV system, it is thought that the capsid mediates nuclear entry. For our capsid-free non-viral genetic medicine, we believe our ceDNA accesses the nucleus due to a previously unrecognized function of the ITR structure. In an in vitro study, we injected plasmid lacking ITR sequences, plasmid containing ITR sequences and ceDNA into the cytoplasm of individual cells. As shown in the figure below, the plasmid lacking ITR sequences was not able to access the nucleus, and the plasmid containing ITR sequences resulted in low but measurable expression. By contrast, ceDNA displayed positive green fluorescent protein, or GFP, expression, indicating that the ceDNA had effectively translocated to the nucleus.
ceDNA’s ITR structure drives translocation to the nucleus
Episomal expression
ceDNA-derived expression has been observed in in vivo and in vitro studies to be episomal, meaning that it can deliver genetic material outside of the chromosome without being directly incorporated into or altering the cell’s genome. This characteristic of ceDNA is a potentially important safety feature of our redosable genetic medicine platform. In cell culture studies, as depicted in the figure below, the expression in dividing cells transfected with ceDNA encoding GFP decayed rapidly as the cells divided, consistent with lack of genomic integration as each successive cell division effectively diluted the amount of ceDNA in new generations of cells. In contrast, in cells transfected with ceDNA encoding GFP which are post-mitotic and therefore not dividing, we observed sustained and durable GFP expression over the course of two weeks.

ceDNA capacity
The large payload capacity of ceDNA enables our constructs to carry large genes, multiple genes, or combinations of genes with regulatory elements. This capacity arises from the lack of capsid packaging constraints that limit DNA incorporation in AAV gene therapy to less than 4.7 kb. Our manufacturing process using RES routinely prepares constructs of up to 8 kb in length without loss in yield or quality. We have not identified an upper limit of construct length. We believe ceDNA can deliver a significant majority of the human coding sequences known to be relevant for the treatment of diseases that result from mutations in a single gene or in multiple genes. The practical applications of increased capacity include the ability:

● | to improve expression of existing targets of viral gene therapy and mRNA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to incorporate genes too large to be packaged in viral vectors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | to include multiple genes, or to produce more than one transcript, which opens the possibility of creating several therapeutic molecules per ceDNA to address conditions that need more than one type of genetic correction; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to add native regulatory elements that are naturally associated with the gene we are replacing, which may allow for activity of the replaced gene to increase or decrease in response to the body’s own signals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have observed the impact of the increased payload capacity of our constructs on improved expression efficiency in in vitro and in vivo studies. We undertook studies of Factor VIII, a protein involved in the coagulation cascade. Defects in Factor VIII are known to give rise to hemophilia A. Factor VIII is a large protein having a minimal gene of interest domain accounting for 4.4 kb (in the B-domain deleted format) which is almost the entire AAV capsid capacity. For this reason, AAV Factor VIII constructs currently in clinical development contain the minimal, B-domain deleted coding region along with a small core promoter of 0.3 kb and limited transcriptional enhancer regions.
We have designed ceDNA constructs that have larger promoter elements and more substantial transcriptional enhancer regions than can be accommodated within the payload capacity of AAV. We have observed in a mouse model that a ceDNA construct, labeled as GB ceDNA in the figure below, showed six-fold improved expression of Factor VIII relative to ceDNA constructs with the expression cassette of each of three AAV Factor VIII product candidates currently in clinical 

18



development. The identification of constructs with improved potency may enable us to lower the dose required to achieve therapeutic efficacy.
Increased ceDNA payload capacity enables the design of more potent constructs
In addition to improving the activity of typical AAV target genes like Factor VIII, the capacity of ceDNA allows us to address monogenic diseases caused by large genes whose coding region is outside of the packaging capacity of AAV. One such example is LCA10, the most common genetic cause of childhood vision loss. LCA10 is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene, which has a gene of interest region of 7.4 kb. Since this exceeds the payload capacity of AAV, there are no current transfer-based gene therapy programs in clinical trials for LCA10. By replacing the entire gene, gene therapy can potentially restore vision to patients with all forms of LCA10, irrespective of which mutation is present. We have created a ceDNA construct encoding the CEP290 gene that has demonstrated expression of full-length protein after transfection in cells, as shown in the immunoblot below.
Expression of full length CEP290 in vitro
In in vivo studies, we have encoded and expressed two different proteins independently within the same ceDNA construct. To do this, we created a ceDNA that independently expressed heavy and light chain fragments of the antibody immunoglobulin, or IgG, with unique promoters for each, a requirement for producing distinct and separate proteins off one construct. Each promoter, a unique sequence that defines where DNA transcription starts, governs the independent production of its own transcript. This construct was able to produce fully formed and secreted IgG in vivo, as shown in the 

19



figure below. This ability to include novel multi-gene constructs to produce complex biologics, such as mAbs, also opens the potential to address conditions that need more than one type of genetic correction, such as one that could knock down a gene and another that replaces a missing or defective gene.
ceDNA dual promoter construct produced fully formed and secreted IgG in vivo
We have also shown in in vitro studies that our constructs can establish context-dependent expression by inclusion of regulatory sequences. The inclusion of regulatory sequences may enable expression of the therapeutic protein to adjust in response to changes in the patient’s body, an example of which might be an anti-inflammatory antibody that is only expressed when the patient is in an inflammatory state. For these studies, we created a construct that contained multiple simian virus 40, or SV40, -derived nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, or NFkb, and DNA-targeting sequences, or DTS, that are known to be responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNFα. As shown in the figure below, expression in HepG2 cells, as measured in reflected light units, or RLUs, was significantly increased in the presence of TNFα relative to control.
Regulatory elements increased expression with TNFα stimulus
We believe this finding supports the potential to develop context-dependent expression cassettes and to take advantage of the sequence capacity necessary to accomplish this. Another example of such an application would be the inclusion of the native promoter in a construct expressing ABCB4 for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type III where the native 

20



promoter is approximately 3.0 kb in size, which restricts its application in viral gene therapy. We have prepared this ceDNA and demonstrated that it expresses protein in cell culture.
ceDNA modalities
The application of ceDNA as a versatile DNA construct comprising large gene capacity and nuclear access creates several attractive therapeutic modalities. Our core focus has been on the application of ceDNA to therapeutic gene transfer, which leverages durable episomal expression in the nucleus of post-mitotic target cells. An extension of this work has been the application of ceDNA to mAb secretion from hepatocytes. We have recently extended the use of ceDNA with our ctLNP technology to the vaccine modality where we intend to build upon the success of mRNA vaccines but look to differentiate in any of three key dimensions: efficacy, durability and drug product stability. Finally, the full realization of the potential for in vivo gene editing requires delivery of a DNA template for full gene insertion. We believe that using ceDNA for this full gene insertion modality may provide all of the advantages of non-viral delivery, most notably the ability to titrate to effect for lifelong gene correction. 
Our research and development of ceDNA has dramatically increased our understanding of the construct’s properties, capabilities and in vivo functioning. We have filed numerous patent applications on our innovations in ceDNA structure, applications of the technology and specific classes of therapeutic ceDNA. We intend to continue investing in both ceDNA development and its intellectual property protection.
ceDNA – one construct, multiple modalities
​
Cell-targeted LNP (ctLNP) delivery system
Lipid nanoparticle technology has been developed over the past two decades for the effective delivery of nucleic acids to the liver, culminating in the first approved small interfering RNA therapy for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis. Second-generation LNP technologies incorporate novel lipid components that improve potency, increase tolerability and are biodegradable. A second-generation LNP was clinically validated in a Phase 1 study of a passive immunization approach to Chikungunya virus. We have hired a team of chemists and formulation scientists along with cellular biologists and pharmacologists to advance our LNP technology and expertise. We are developing deep expertise and a broad set of assets for ctLNP delivery, which can be broken down into three areas. First, we are developing key chemistry, formulation and analytical capacity to optimize selective targeting of ctLNPs to target cells of interest. Second, we have invested in 

21



formulation process and purification capabilities, specifically aimed at the unique attributes of formulating large DNA constructs. We have prepared ctLNPs with target size ranges of 70-75 nm consistent with other validated LNP nucleic acid platforms and homogenous sizes along with uniform surface properties and high encapsulation percentages. Finally, we have also identified novel, proprietary lipid classes, particularly for the key ionizable lipid components of our ctLNPs.
​
ctLNP – each ctLNP creates modular access to a therapeutic area
Building on the attributes of both the first- and second-generation LNP technology, we have designed our ctLNP delivery platform so that its biodistribution can be selectively controlled through compositional optimization. In addition, our ctLNP may confer the advantages of predictable behavior across species, minimal off-target effects, and a foundational platform approach that unlocks the ability to deliver to other tissues, including retina, skeletal muscle, the CNS and tumors. The graphic below illustrates the evolution from first generation LNPs to ctLNP.
​

22



Novel ctLNP enables compositionally-driven cell and tissue targeting
A key feature of our ctLNP technology is compositional optimization to derive cell type specificity. The selective control of biodistribution has historically been unavailable to nanoparticles. This is primarily due to the non-specific and efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, a system of cells that removes immune complexes and foreign particulates from circulation in healthy persons, and historically limits the desired selective distribution to target cells. We have applied our chemistry and formulation capabilities to identify LNPs that avoid reticuloendothelial system-mediated clearance, which has enabled the compositional optimization for selective cell type delivery. We have achieved proof of concept for tissue-specific delivery with ctLNP in vivo for liver and retina and in vitro for skeletal muscle. 
We plan to continue to seek to optimize ctLNPs for use in liver and retina and to expand their application across a range of tissues, including the CNS, skeletal muscle, and tumors and potentially systemic or locally focused delivery. We have filed numerous patent applications to solidify our leadership in this area, including ones covering fundamental LNP technology as well as methods to avoid or reduce immune response.
Liver
We have employed N-acetyl galactosamine, or GalNAc, as the ligand of choice for targeting the majority of liver cells, called hepatocytes, through the asialoglycoprotein receptor, or ASGPr, a well validated, selective ligand-receptor pair for delivery to hepatocytes that is conserved across species including mouse, rat, non-human primates, or NHPs, and humans. Prior third-party research has shown that GalNAc-targeted oligonucleotides impart broad distribution to the majority of hepatocytes and demonstrated that their pharmacology is strongly correlated from NHPs to humans. When we dosed GalNAc targeted ctLNPs in mice, we observed a profound selectivity for ceDNA delivery to the liver. As shown in the left figure below, ceDNA was distributed selectively to the liver, with more than 97% of the total ceDNA copies in that tissue. By contrast, less than 3% of the copies per tissue was present in blood, lung, spleen and kidney combined. This stands in contrast to first generation LNPs, as shown in the middle and right figures below. At six hours post administration, first generation LNPs distribute equal ceDNA copies in spleen relative to liver. In contrast, distribution of ceDNA with ctLNP is highly selective for liver at this time point. This selectivity enhancement of ctLNP relative to first-generation LNP minimized off-target effects and enabled well-tolerated dosing up to 5.0 mg/kg in mice. When we examined the liver tissue by in situ hybridization, we observed up to 100% of hepatocytes transduced with ceDNA at early time points, highlighting the breadth of distribution of ctLNP. Additionally, we have demonstrated the successful dosing of a ctLNP in preliminary NHP experiments at doses up to 0.5 mg/kg. The 0.5 mg/kg ctLNP dose level was tolerated and not associated with signs of hepatotoxicity.

We have demonstrated in mice both high-level and dose-dependent expression from ceDNA incorporating our ctLNP system using a reporter ceDNA that expresses firefly luciferase after a single intravenous administration on day one. The expression was also determined to be dose proportional as we increased the ctLNP from 0.5 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg, as shown in the left figure below. The protein expression was specific to the liver region as determined by in-life imaging, as shown in the right figure below. We continue to apply chemistry and formulation optimization efforts to improve the activity of ctLNP, with our latest ctLNPs providing three to five times improvements in expression over our first iteration. We plan to continue to make further improvements in this technology.
High-level and dose-dependent luciferase expression from ceDNA-ctLNP
In two further in vivo studies, we demonstrated translation of expression from mice to NHPs and confirmed delivery of ceDNA to the liver via ctLNPs in NHPs. In the studies, we delivered the same weight-adjusted dose of a ceDNA construct in each species systemically via a liver-directed ctLNP and observed an approximately 2:1 species translation from mice to NHPs. In the first study, we observed a mean human factor VIII expression level of approximately 1% of normal levels in mice at day 7 following a single 1.0 mg/kg dose of the ceDNA construct and a mean human factor VIII expression level of approximately 1% of normal levels in NHPs at day 5 using identical material and weight-adjusted dosing (1.0 mg/kg) as shown in the left figure below. In the second study, employing a slightly different ctLNP, we observed a mean human factor VIII expression level of approximately 3% of normal levels in mice at day 5 following a single 2.0 mg/kg dose of the ceDNA construct and a mean human factor VIII expression level of approximately 1% of normal levels in NHPs at day 5 using identical material and weight-adjusted dosing (2.0 mg/kg) as shown in the right figure below.
All doses in mice and NHPs were well-tolerated up to the highest dose of 2.0 mg/kg. There were no adverse clinical observations, changes in clinical pathology, or histopathology findings including in the liver and spleen in NHPs.

Species translation with research construct (systemic IV administration via ctLNP, day 5 or 7)
​
In subsequent mouse studies with RES-derived ceDNA delivered by ctLNP, we observed peak mean human factor VIII expression of 205% of normal at 2.0 mg/kg. In addition to the increased potency attributed to the RES-produced ceDNA and to ctLNP production process innovations, we observed lower variability of human factor VIII expression and of tolerability within and between mouse studies.  Findings from companion studies in NHPs, which used the same ceDNA-ctLNP materials used in the mouse studies, demonstrated human factor VIII expression of up to 2% of normal at 2.0 mg/kg, with higher-than-expected variability in both factor VIII expression and tolerability within and across studies. We believe that this variability and lower-than-desired overall species translation may be attributed to binding of our ctLNPs to certain NHP-specific circulating proteins called opsonins, leading to sub-optimal hepatocyte distribution and increased off-target immune cell biodistribution, which may induce immune system activation. We believe additional ctLNP optimization is needed to translate the improvement in potency and reduction in variability observed in mice to NHP, and to support nomination of a development candidate for our hemophilia A program.
Retina
In addition to assessing the specificity and activity of ctLNP established for systemic administration to the liver, we have also assessed ctLNP in local administration to the retina in the eye. Second-generation LNPs containing ceDNA, when dosed subretinally in vivo in rats, led to significant inflammation and retinal degeneration and failed to express protein. This degeneration is evident by measuring the thickness of the outer nuclear layer, or ONL, by optical coherence tomography imaging, shown in the yellow labels in the figures below. By contrast, administration of ctLNP subretinally in vivo in rats led to high levels of expression at day 14 and lack of retinal degeneration at day 21. We believe this improved retinal tolerability profile is due to ctLNP avoiding off-target delivery to local immune cells. We have additionally demonstrated efficient transduction of retinal photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial, or RPE, cells with ctLNP, which we believe enables disease relevant expression for our lead retinal programs, Stargardt disease and LCA10.

25



Subretinal injection of ceDNA-ctLNP led to high levels of expression and lack of retinal degeneration
Additionally, as shown in the figure below of a cross section of the retina, data from our study of the sub-retinal delivery of mRNA using ctLNP in mice demonstrated broad and uniform photoreceptor expression at comparable levels to that achieved with adeno-associated virus Type 5, or AAV5, delivery, which is the current standard for retinal gene therapy. 
ctLNP-mRNA demonstrated broad photoreceptor distribution versus AAV5 which appears punctate
In addition, as shown in the figure below of a cross section of the retina, our study in NHPs on the sub-retinal delivery of mRNA using ctLNP demonstrated species-translation from rodent to NHPs. Our study also demonstrated comparable tolerability and uniform photoreceptor expression across species. These findings support the viability of our non-viral delivery system for mRNA, potentially enabling gene editing in the retina and we believe our ctLNP will allow us to address a variety of inherited retinal diseases.

Vaccines
The proliferation of mRNA-based vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the utility of LNP-delivered vaccines in combatting the current pandemic. We have begun to leverage our LNP delivery system to explore ctLNPs for vaccines that could deliver either mRNA or ceDNA. In recent preclinical studies, we observed as shown in the figures below, that at a dose of 10μg, our proprietary mRNA-ctLNP met a similar benchmark of neutralizing antibody response in mice as that reported for Moderna, Inc.’s mRNA1273, a COVID-19 vaccine that the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved for individuals ages 18 and older. Similar findings were observed in NHPs at a dose of 100μg, suggesting species translation. We believe a novel mRNA-ctLNP vaccine could represent an important alternative to existing mRNA vaccines. 
We are also in the early research stage of evaluating ceDNA-based vaccines delivered by ctLNP. As shown in the figures below, in a study we conducted in mice, we observed that the administration of a 3μg dose of our next-generation ceDNA-ctLNP vaccine resulted in an antibody response greater than our first-generation ceDNA-ctLNP vaccine and nearing comparable levels to one of our mRNA-ctLNP vaccines. This antibody response was further improved by increasing the interval between the initial dose and a prime boost dose. We believe a ceDNA-ctLNP vaccine could have important advantages over mRNA-based vaccines, including greater durability of immune response and stability of drug product at ambient temperatures, making it potentially more amenable to global distribution.

Skeletal muscle
We have identified a number of potential ligands for skeletal muscle and have been able to conjugate peptide-based ligands to ctLNP that have enhanced uptake into a differentiated skeletal muscle cell line, or myocyte, in vitro. These peptide-based ligands target known receptors, such as the transferrin receptor that is present on the surface of skeletal muscle. ctLNPs that include these peptide-based ligands on the surface of the particle show high levels of uptake in muscle cells in culture. We have observed this in in vitro studies in which we included a red dye in the ctLNP enabling quantification of uptake into these cells, as shown in the figure below. We are pursuing muscle-targeted ctLNPs for in vivo, systemic administration to target skeletal muscle and replace missing or defective genes, such as dystrophin in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Enhanced uptake in c2c12 myocytes
LNPs are one of the most advanced non-viral delivery solutions for nucleic acid therapeutics. We have built on the attributes of the second generation of clinical LNPs, which include improved tolerability through utilization of biodegradable lipids. Specifically, we have engineered our ctLNP to allow for active targeting of specific cell types in vivo. Targeted delivery of DNA in vivo without incurring innate immune reactions has long been a challenge in the field. The profile of our ctLNP has led to further improvements in tolerability, increased delivery efficiency and application to tissues beyond liver and immune cells. Our ctLNP delivery system has shown proof of concept in vivo in liver and retina with in vitro proof of concept for skeletal muscle. We plan to continue to seek to optimize ctLNP for use in liver, retina and skeletal muscle and to expand its application across a range of tissues, including the CNS and tumors. We have filed numerous patent applications to solidify our leadership in this area, including ones covering fundamental LNP technology as well as methods to avoid or reduce immune response.
Highly scalable manufacturing 
Since our founding, we have invested in internalizing core development capabilities to build our manufacturing processes and analytical testing as a point of strength. We have recruited a seasoned team of development and manufacturing experts who have enabled more than 20 INDs and negotiated multiple product launches, including for both a cell and a gene therapy product.
Additionally, we have built state-of-the-art development laboratories to create novel upstream and downstream processes as well as analytical methodologies that have shifted the product profile from early research efforts of approximately 10% pure ceDNA to one that is consistently greater than 99% pure ceDNA. We have developed RES, our novel, next-generation rapid enzymatic approach to manufacture ceDNA that does not rely on Sf9 cells. RES uses enzymes to convert plasmid DNA and synthetic oligonucleotides into ceDNA, similar to the current high-capacity methods used to manufacture mRNA vaccines. RES has consistently yielded highly pure ceDNA, reduced ceDNA variability, and shortened our ceDNA production cycle time from 28 days to one day.
In July 2021, we entered into a lease agreement to build out an approximately 104,000 square foot current cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. The facility, expected to be operational in 2023, is intended for ceDNA manufacturing utilizing RES for drug substance manufacturing and ctLNP production resulting in cGMP-compliant clinical and initial commercial supply. In addition, the new facility is designed to provide expanded capacity for research production and process development activities. We plan to continue to rely on CDMOs during and after construction to provide redundancy and secure additional ceDNA supply.
Our ongoing work in manufacturing technology has led to numerous innovations in production processes and analytics, some of which may have broader applications in related fields. We continue to seek to protect the full reach of these discoveries through both patent application filings and as trade secrets.
Summary
We believe our non-viral genetic medicine platform represents a powerful product engine fueled by ceDNA, which in preclinical studies has provided durable episomal expression with large capacity, and our highly selective and modular ctLNP delivery system. We have designed the combination of these platform components with a goal of enabling a broad 

30



and expandable product portfolio that can be deployed against a range of tissues, including liver, retina, skeletal muscle, the CNS and tumors. These characteristics are supported by our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses our proprietary cell-free RES to produce ceDNA and supports the potential to extend the reach of genetic medicine beyond rare diseases to prevalent diseases.
Our integrated research and development approach 
Our development strategy is differentiated and informed by our extensive experience in rare disease drug development, regulatory engagement and commercialization. We are focused on diseases with significant unmet need for which our non-viral genetic medicine platform may substantially improve clinical efficacy relative to current gene therapy approaches. We are initially prioritizing rare monogenic diseases of the liver and retina that have well-established biomarkers and clear clinical and regulatory pathways. We plan to incorporate redosing in our first-in-human clinical trials, which may allow us to reach the desired therapeutic expression level in every patient, providing early and robust human proof concept.
In parallel, we are developing the constructs and manufacturing capacity for programs to address additional rare and prevalent diseases. We have established a highly efficient four-week research cycle to rapidly design, produce and screen ceDNA constructs to enable new disease programs within a tissue or therapeutic area once human proof of concept is established. By leveraging a common ctLNP for each tissue or therapeutic area, we believe we can reduce the risk and accelerate the speed of development for subsequent indications.
Our research cycle utilizes in vitro activity screens of novel plasmid DNA designs, followed by in vivo activity screens of select ceDNA constructs. We have iteratively employed this cycle to rapidly identify ceDNA constructs that achieve disease correction in animal models and have observed that learnings from our more mature programs accelerate our ability to identify effective ceDNA constructs for subsequent indications.
We plan to apply this integrated research and development strategy across liver, retina, vaccines, skeletal muscle, oncology and the CNS.
Our portfolio 
We are advancing a broad and expansive portfolio including programs for rare and prevalent diseases of the liver and retina. We are focused on diseases with significant unmet need for which our non-viral genetic medicine platform may substantially improve clinical efficacy relative to current genetic medicine approaches. We are initially prioritizing rare monogenic diseases of the liver and retina that have well-established biomarkers and clear clinical and regulatory pathways. In addition, we believe that our non-viral genetic medicine platform may be used to develop therapies that deliver antibody genes to direct the liver to produce antibody therapies for patients’ own cells for years at a time from a single dose. We plan to advance such ETAP programs across multiple therapeutic areas, including prevalent indications. We are also conducting early research into the development of mRNA- and ceDNA-based vaccines, delivered by ctLNPs. We plan to further expand our portfolio to include rare and prevalent diseases of the skeletal muscle, the CNS and oncology by developing discrete ctLNPs, each engineered to reach a different tissue. As shown in the figure below, our most advanced liver disease program is in hemophilia A which is in the preclinical stage of development, and our most advanced retina disease programs are in Stargardt disease and LCA10, which are in the lead optimization stage of development.

31



Within the therapeutic area of the liver, we have also established programs for inborn errors of metabolism in PKU and Wilson disease. We are also advancing programs for systemic disorders in which the liver can be utilized to secrete therapeutic proteins in hemophilia A and Gaucher disease.
We plan to utilize our four-week research cycle to rapidly design, produce and screen ceDNA constructs for other diseases within a tissue or therapeutic area, so that we may rapidly expand clinical development efforts to include additional rare and prevalent diseases once human proof of concept is established in that tissue or therapeutic area. For instance, if human proof of concept is established in hemophilia A, this could support our expansion to other diseases requiring secretion of therapeutic proteins, such as Gaucher disease, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency or antibody therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Similarly, if human proof of concept is established in PKU, we could expand our development efforts to include additional inborn errors of metabolism, such as Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease type 1a or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. We plan to apply this strategic approach of rapid expansion following initial human proof of concept in a therapeutic area across our portfolio.
​
Liver diseases
For the majority of our liver programs, we have designed and manufactured disease-modifying ceDNAs that have shown expression in vitro and/or disease correction in vivo. We have employed GalNAc as the targeting ligand in our ctLNP delivery system to selectively drive biodistribution to the liver. GalNAc binds to the ASGPr on hepatocytes, and the biology of this selective ligand-receptor pair for delivery to hepatocytes has been well validated in human clinical trials. For each liver program, we plan to formulate ceDNA expressing the relevant gene of interest within a ctLNP-GalNAc for intravenous delivery. GalNAc targeting has been demonstrated to efficiently deliver ceDNA to up to 100% of hepatocytes and we believe that broad biodistribution of ctLNP-GalNAc to hepatocytes will be a key strength of our pipeline programs since current gene therapy approaches deliver payload to 30% or fewer of hepatocytes with a single dose. Additionally, our potential to redose patients until they are in the therapeutic range of expression may enable early and robust human proof of concept in Phase 1/2 clinical trials and is a key differentiator from current gene therapy approaches.
Hemophilia A
Overview
Hemophilia A is a rare X-linked hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by impaired blood coagulation as a result of deficiencies in the production or function of coagulation Factor VIII. There are approximately 16,000 hemophilia A patients in the United States and 320,000 patients worldwide. Because of the deficiency of coagulation Factor VIII, hemophilia A patients bleed in joints, muscles, soft tissues and within mucous membranes, which can be either 

32



spontaneous or due to internal or external trauma, depending on the severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of hemophilia A can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on the residual level of circulating Factor VIII. The diagnosis of hemophilia A is often made at a young age, earlier than 36 months, based on persistent bleeding or internal hemorrhage.
Current approaches and limitations
Most patients with hemophilia A in the United States and the European Union are currently treated with clotting factors according to practice guidelines, which are relatively consistent around the world. Children are generally treated prophylactically, while adults may be treated either prophylactically or on demand, depending on the residual level of Factor VIII activity in the blood. Compliance with clotting factors is 50% to 80%, and up to 30% of patients with severe disease develop inhibitors to Factor VIII replacement. Approximately 75% of hemophilia A patients worldwide still receive inadequate treatment or have no access to treatment.
HEMLIBRA (emicizumab) is a bispecific Factor IXa- and Factor X-directed antibody indicated for routine adult and pediatric patients ages newborn and older with hemophilia A. However, this product has safety concerns as several cases of thrombotic microangiopathy/thrombosis have occurred, in some cases in the context of co-administration of activated prothrombin complex concentrate.
There are several AAV gene therapies currently in late-stage clinical trials, including valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for which the FDA initially issued a complete response letter, or CRL, in 2020 for the original biologics license application, or BLA, based on a request for additional long-term data to support potential approval. Data from these trials have shown variation in the amount of Factor VIII expressed from patient-to-patient and uncertainty on the durability of effect following valoctocogene roxaparvovec administration. Additionally, a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for valoctocogene roxaparvovec is currently under review with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. However, many hemophilia A patients have pre-existing immunity to AAV and, therefore, are not candidates for this therapy. Mean Factor VIII levels have shown some decline over two to three years after treatment with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, which means that it is possible that levels will continue to decline in longer-term treatment follow-up, eventually to a level that is subtherapeutic, and patients cannot be redosed with AAV gene therapy. In addition, AAV gene therapy is unlikely to be available to children with hemophilia A since their livers are still growing and only one dose is possible.
There are no current or investigational therapies that have been shown to durably induce therapeutic Factor VIII levels in all patients of all ages, nor therapies that can be redosed when Factor VIII expression wanes through the life of the patient. Given the variable response to gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, titration at onset of therapy is critical to ensure that all patients get within a therapeutic range. Since there are potential consequences to expressing too much Factor VIII, such as excess blood clotting, the ability to titrate the therapy will enable an optimal dosing regimen.
Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to do the following in hemophilia A:

● | achieve therapeutic Factor VIII levels in patients of all ages, resulting in normalization of bleeding risk;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | treat infants and children to prevent bleeds early in disease and prevent irreversible tissue and organ dysfunction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve the desired level of gene expression in a greater proportion of patients participating in our early clinical trials through our ability to redose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ensure that all patients achieve curative levels of Factor VIII of greater than 25% of normal activity levels with the ability to titrate expression to higher target levels for some patients as needed based on lifestyle and circumstances;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | deliver ceDNA-FVIII to a large percentage of hepatocytes resulting in a relatively low burden of expression for each hepatocyte, which may lead to more durable expression compared to other gene therapy modalities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

33




● | increase the safety index by achieving therapeutic Factor VIII levels at lower doses because of more potent ceDNA-FVIII constructs and greater hepatic biodistribution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our approach has the potential to titrate expression in each patient to reach target Factor VIII levels, avoiding supratherapeutic levels and minimizing the thrombotic, or clotting, risk to the patient. In addition, we can potentially treat patients for life by episodically following Factor VIII levels and redosing as needed, should expression wane over time. Redosing may also enable broader access for all patients with severe disease, and for children with mild to moderate disease severity who are currently managed through on-demand treatment, as shown in the right figure below.
We have created multiple distinct ceDNA-FVIII constructs with different expression cassette elements, including promoter, intron, untranslated regions, or UTRs, and codon optimization sequences. In vitro screening of ceDNA-FVIII constructs revealed that several constructs express Factor VIII, as defined by functional activity measures, as shown in the figure below. All of our ceDNA constructs, labeled as GB ceDNA in the figure below, expressed greater activity of FVIII compared to a ceDNA construct with the expression cassette of an AAV-FVIII product candidate that is currently in clinical trials, AAV #1, with some expressing up to six-fold more Factor VIII activity.
Several ceDNA-FVIII demonstrated greater activity compared to AAV-FVIII
The enhanced potency of our ceDNA-FVIII constructs has also been confirmed in vivo. In an in vivo study, we measured serum levels of human Factor VIII after hydrodynamic injection of various ceDNA constructs into the tail vein of mice and assessed protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human Factor VIII. As shown in the figure below, two ceDNA constructs listed as GB ceDNA #1 and GB ceDNA #2 demonstrated 1.0 and 6.0 IU/ml Factor VIII activity, or 100% and 600% of normal levels, respectively. In contrast, at the same dose, ceDNA constructs with the expression cassette of each of three AAV-FVIII product candidates currently in clinical development, demonstrated approximately 0.5 IU/ml Factor VIII activity, or 50% of normal levels in animals.

34



In vivo activity of ceDNA-FVIII constructs
The direct relevance of having more potent ceDNA constructs is that the input dose required to have a therapeutic effect may be lower, thereby increasing the safety profile and lowering the metabolic requirements on individual hepatocytes to produce and secrete Factor VIII.
In a separate in vivo study, we achieved targeted levels of human factor VIII expression in hemophilia A mice at day 10 following a single dose of a ceDNA construct delivered systemically via a liver-directed ctLNP. In this study, which was conducted in three cohorts and used Sf9-derived ceDNA, we observed a dose-response relationship with a mean human factor VIII expression level of 23% of normal levels following a dose of 2.0 mg/kg, a mean human factor VIII expression level of 16% of normal levels following a dose of 1.0 mg/kg and a mean human factor VIII expression level of 9% of normal levels following a dose of 0.5 mg/kg as shown in the figure below. The doses were well-tolerated by the hemophilia A mice at all dose levels.
Expression of FVIII in mice dosed with hemophilia A development construct
(systemic IV administration via ctLNP at Day 10)
We conducted comparable mouse studies with RES-derived ceDNA delivered by ctLNP, we observed a peak mean human factor VIII expression of 205% of normal at 2.0 mg/kg. In addition to the increased potency attributed to the RES-produced ceDNA and to ctLNP production process innovations, we observed lower variability of human factor VIII expression and of tolerability within and between mouse studies. However, in companion studies in NHPs, which used the same ceDNA-

35



ctLNP materials used in the mouse studies, we observed human factor VIII expression of up to 2% of normal at 2.0 mg/kg, with higher-than-expected variability in both factor VIII expression and tolerability within and across studies. 
Expression of FVIII in mice and NHP dosed with hemophilia A development construct
Next steps
We plan to continue to seek to optimize our ctLNP in order to translate the improvement in potency and reduction in variability observed in mice with the RES-derived ceDNA to NHPs, and to support nomination of a development candidate for our hemophilia A program.
Phenylketonuria
Overview
PKU is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, or PAH, that metabolizes the essential amino acid phenylalanine, or Phe, to tyrosine, or Tyr, an essential amino acid for CNS development and function. PAH deficiency leads to elevated levels of Phe in the blood and toxic Phe accumulation in the brain resulting in neurocognitive manifestations including failure to attain early developmental milestones and progressive impairment of cerebral function. Patients with uncontrolled severe PKU will develop profound neuropsychiatric disorders and irreversible intellectual disability.
There are approximately 15,000 patients with PKU in the United States and 41,000 patients in the European Union. PKU is usually diagnosed at birth through newborn screening, which provides the opportunity to introduce therapies that reduce Phe levels. However, as shown in the left figure below, without strict dietary control, current therapies do not normalize Phe levels. Attaining consistent levels of Phe in childhood is correlated with higher IQ levels and executive functioning in adults, and short-term spikes in Phe result in long-term impairment of neurocognitive function, as shown in the middle 

36



figure below. Even without optimal correction of Phe levels in childhood, control in adolescent and adult PKU patients has been shown to result in higher levels of executive function and attention and lower levels of depression and anxiety. As shown in the right figure below, adolescents are unable to maintain such a strict diet, with 50% of patients aged 10-14 above the recommended Phe levels and almost 80% of patients outside the normal Phe range in the late teen years.
Early consistent Phe normalization key to neurocognitive outcome
Current approaches and limitations
The standard of care for PKU is strict, life-long dietary modification to control blood Phe levels to the recommended target range of 120 to 360 micromoles per liter. This requires PKU patients and caregivers to carefully monitor diet and severely restrict protein intake and other Phe-rich foods. Medical foods including formula and foods modified to be low in protein are also required.
Initiation of a Phe-restricted diet is recommended as early as possible in infancy to avoid irreversible neurocognitive decline due to elevated Phe levels. While this allows some patients to approach target Phe levels, it is challenging to maintain as a life-long treatment. Even with full compliance of dietary therapy during childhood, many patients have episodic or chronic high Phe levels and suffer irreversible neurocognitive impairment as a result.
PALYNZIQ (pegvaliase) and KUVAN (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a biologic and a small molecule, respectively, are approved in the United States for patients with PKU and both have been shown to have modest benefits in a subset of patients. PALYNZIQ is approved only for adult PKU patients. KUVAN does not normalize Phe in most patients and has shown to be ineffective in patients with severe PKU. Despite treatment advances, including availability of a larger selection of medical and low protein foods and the approval of the two treatments, many patients still do not achieve the recommended daily Phe levels and are at risk of developing neurocognitive manifestations, including intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Several AAV gene therapy approaches are currently being tested in clinical trials in patients with PKU. However, following a single dose of AAV, antibodies are induced against the AAV capsid and thus, AAV gene therapy can only be administered once. The antibodies formed following a single dose of AAV prevent re-treatment to increase or extend efficacy for patients with inadequate initial response or declining levels of expression. Further, it precludes treatment of pediatric patients, whose organ growth and dividing cells would dilute expression over time, and therefore would require redosing. As a result, these therapies do not have the opportunity to correct PKU at or near the onset of disease, allowing for normal neurocognitive development.

37



Given the limitations of currently approved therapies and the AAV gene therapy approaches under development, there is a substantial unmet need for more effective therapies for PKU.
Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to:

● | achieve stable correction of Phe levels in PKU patients of all ages upon initial dose or through individualized patient dose titration, allowing them to normalize their diet, eliminate the burden of ongoing treatment and stabilizing and/or preserving neurocognitive function;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve the desired level of gene expression for each patient through our ability to redose;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | treat patients effectively for life by episodically monitoring serum Phe levels and redosing as needed, should expression wane over time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reverse attention, memory or executive function deficits in adults and adolescents; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preserve normal neurocognitive development in infants and children.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

We have utilized the established mouse model of PKU, known as PAHenu2, a mouse model in which the PAH gene is mutated and leads to dramatically elevated Phe, to assess the ability of our ceDNA-derived PAH gene to normalize Phe levels below 360 micromolar, or µM Phe. In one study, we administered select Sf9 produced ceDNA-PAH constructs by hydrodynamic injection into PAHenu2 mice and measured serum Phe levels over time. As shown in the figure below, the PAHenu2 mice serum samples at baseline exhibited very high Phe levels of greater than 1100µM. PAHenu2 mice treated with vehicle (green line) showed no change in Phe levels over time whereas mice that received Gen2-construct 1 or construct 2 dropped below target Phe levels (shown by the dashed red line) at three and seven days after intravenous administration of our ceDNA-PAH constructs.

38



​
Next steps
We believe that our efforts to optimize ctLNP to translate the improvement in potency and reduction in variability observed in mice to NHPs may also enable advancement of our PKU program. As such, we plan to focus on lead optimization in 2022 for our PKU program with the goal of identifying potent RES ceDNA-PAH constructs that provide disease relevant expression, defined as Phe normalization in PAHenu2 in mice after IV administration of ceDNA-PAH. We plan to pair these constructs with our ctLNP once optimized for species translation and evaluated in preclinical studies.
Wilson disease
Overview
Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to a loss-of-function mutation in the ATB7B copper transporter. There are approximately 11,000 patients with Wilson disease in the United States and 17,000 patients in the European Union. Mutations in the ATP7B copper transporter prevent incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin and diminishes biliary secretion of copper excess, resulting in toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Clinically, liver damage begins by six years of life and then progresses with inflammation, fibrosis and joint pain. Many patients also develop CNS manifestations of copper overload, including psychosis, tremors, dysarthria, or slurred speech and muscle stiffness.
Current approaches and limitations
There are no approved gene therapies for Wilson disease. Current treatment approaches include chelators promoting excretion of copper from the body and zinc salts that reduce copper absorption. These therapies have demonstrated limited effectiveness and safety issues, resulting in poor compliance in patients. The only curative option for acute liver failure related to Wilson disease today is a liver transplant, which cannot be offered to most patients due to lack of availability of 

39



matched donors. The average age of Wilson disease patients undergoing liver transplantation is 15 years old for those who have an available donor, indicating the need for intervention in childhood to prevent progression to this point.
There are no current genetic medicine clinical trials for Wilson disease. The ATP7B gene is 4.4 kb, which means the size of the gene plus the remainder of the expression cassette cannot fit within an AAV. One preclinical AAV gene therapy program, known as VTX-801, is in development for Wilson disease utilizing a truncated ATP7B gene that may not have the full functionality of ATP7B.
Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to do the following:

● | enable full correction of copper metabolism by broadly transducing hepatocytes and utilizing full-length ATP7B gene and an optimized expression cassette;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve full hepatic correction early in the disease, re-directing copper to be incorporated into ceruloplasmin and normalizing bile excretion, thereby avoiding hepatic and CNS tissue accumulation and irreversible liver fibrosis and neurocognitive decline;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | initiate treatment in children, early in the disease, to prevent the accumulation of liver damage and irreversible neurocognitive decline;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain correction of hepatocytes by redosing to compensate for the effect of injury-driven cell division in the liver;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve the appropriate therapeutic level of ATP7B needed for correction using serum biomarkers via individualized patient titration at the onset of therapy; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain copper and ceruloplasmin levels in the normal range throughout life with maintenance therapy, as needed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps
We plan to continue our lead optimization in 2022 for this program.
Gaucher disease, Type 1
Overview
Gaucher disease is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by the insufficient expression of lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, or GCase. Gaucher disease is the most common inherited lysosomal storage disease. There are approximately 6,000 patients with Gaucher disease in the United States and 9,000 patients in the European Union. Ninety percent of Gaucher patients are classified as Type 1, the most common form, which has no CNS involvement in the disease. Patients with Type 1 disease are typically diagnosed between 10 to 15 years of age.
Patients with Gaucher disease do not produce adequate levels of GCase, which causes glucosylceramide, a toxic lipid, to accumulate in macrophage lineage cells in visceral organs. This results in splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and cytopenia. Disease progression commonly involves loss of bone mass, either osteopenia or osteoporosis and can lead to painful bone crises and avascular necrosis, or death of bone tissue. We are specifically developing a genetic medicine approach to address Type 1 Gaucher disease.

40



Current approaches and limitations
The current standard of care for Gaucher disease includes enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, for patients of all ages or substrate reduction therapy, or SRT, for adults with Type 1. ERT is recommended as a potentially suitable treatment for all symptomatic Type 1 patients, though the required IV infusions every two weeks can lead to difficult treatment burden.
SRT treats Gaucher disease by inhibiting cellular production of glucosylceramide, rather than increasing the degradation of glucosylceramides through ERT. ZAVESCA (miglustat) and CERDELGA (eliglustat) effectively treat hepatosplenomegaly in a similar time course to ERT, though improvement in hematological aspects of the disease takes longer to materialize. SRT does not correct the fundamental lack of GCase and biochemical and tissue abnormalities persist.
Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to:

● | provide continuous therapeutic levels of GCase in serum and tissues that can break down glucosylceramide, which may enhance tissue correction over episodic ERT;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | administer ceDNA-GCase early in disease before the onset of inflammation, fibrosis and irreversible tissue injury;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve the appropriate GCase levels for potential disease modification using biomarkers such as glucosylsphingosine, or Lyso-Gb1, via individualized patient titration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | treat patients for life by maintaining Lyso-Gb1 levels in the normal range through redosing as needed; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduce immune reactions to GCase, which occur in 2% to 15% of Gaucher patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps
We plan to continue our lead optimization in 2022 for this program.
Endogenous Therapeutic Antibody Production (ETAP)
Overview
We plan to advance product candidates to deliver antibody genes to direct the liver to express and secrete antibodies. mAbs have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in many areas, including infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology and oncology.
We believe that utilizing the patient’s own cells to produce and secrete therapeutic mAbs, fragments or derivatives is a potentially transformative approach that can result in greater efficacy, produced at a larger scale and with lower cost of goods compared to the passive administration of some mAbs.
Current approaches and limitations
The cost of goods, the burden of frequent administration and the manufacturing scale limitations of mAb therapy preclude their widespread utilization in many diseases.

41



Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to:

● | enable a patient’s own body to sustainably produce and secrete a therapeutic mAb from the liver by introducing ceDNA-ctLNP for ETAP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enable continuous production of protein, resulting in a stable, effective level of serum mAb, thereby avoiding toxicity due to off-target effects of pulsatile delivery and/or loss of efficacy often associated with rapid reduction in concentrations when delivered passively;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | rapidly induce a therapeutic effect due to liver production of the therapeutic mAb within days of administration;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potentially eliminate compliance risk due to sustained expression after a single dose;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | encode multiple mAbs on a single ceDNA construct for broad therapeutic application;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve the appropriate mAb levels in the blood via individualized patient titration; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | induce rapid onset, durable immunity via expression of mAbs to prevent infection for large populations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have demonstrated hepatic expression of antibodies with ceDNA-ctLNP for ETAP. As shown in the figure below, hydrodynamic injection of ceDNA-ctLNP for ETAP resulted in serum mAb levels of greater than 40.0 µg/ml. Since many therapeutic mAbs are effective at serum concentrations of 1.0 to 5.0 µg/ml, we believe the level of mAb expression observed with our ceDNA-ctLNP for ETAP is likely to be therapeutically relevant in humans.
Hydrodynamic injection of ceDNA-ctLNP for ETAP results in serum levels up to 40.0µg/ml

42



We have also demonstrated stacking of mAb expression after repeat dosing via hydrodynamic injection, as shown in the figure below.
mAb expression increases after repeat dosing via hydrodynamic injection
Data from an in vivo study conducted as part of our research collaboration with Vir Biotechnology, Inc. demonstrated that mice treated with ceDNA encoding an anti-SARS-CoV2 monoclonal antibody delivered via LNP generated persistent anti-spike protein human antibody concentrations with a peak level of 8µg/ml, which corresponds to a level that may be therapeutically relevant in humans. Furthermore, endogenously produced antibodies in the serum of ceDNA-treated mice 

43



retained binding and functional activity, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo at the same level as recombinantly produced mAbs.
​
LNP delivery of ceDNA vectorized monoclonal antibody demonstrated persistent concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV2 hIgG in mice that may be therapeutically relevant
​
Next steps
We are advancing our initial ETAP program for the treatment of infectious diseases and we are evaluating ceDNA constructs that express neutralizing mAbs targeting a surface protein for a variety of infectious agents, including hepatitis B virus, or HBV, HIV and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. 
Retinal diseases
Approximately 200 million individuals suffer from inherited retinal diseases, in which a gene mutation leads to degeneration of the retina. Many of these diseases are caused by genes too large to be enclosed within AAV, including LCA10 and Stargardt disease. Current AAV gene therapy approaches are not able to encode and deliver large genetic payloads and cannot provide the full gene required to treat LCA10 and Stargardt disease. We believe using ceDNA to deliver large gene payloads efficiently and specifically to relevant cell types in the retina, with the opportunity to optimize ctLNP for minimally invasive routes of delivery, represents an important therapeutic approach.
Stargardt disease
Overview
Stargardt disease is the most common inherited macular dystrophy. There are approximately 37,000 patients with Stargardt disease in the United States and 66,000 patients in the European Union. Stargardt disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutation in the ABCA4 gene that is expressed in both the RPE and retinal photoreceptors. Loss of ABCA4 function 

44



disrupts normal processing of retinaldehyde, or Vitamin A, in both photoreceptors and RPE cells leading to accumulation of toxic bis-retinoid byproducts and photoreceptor death. Patients usually present in childhood with loss of visual acuity and exhibit progressive loss of RPE and photoreceptor cells.
Current approaches and limitations
There are currently no proven treatments for Stargardt disease. The ABCA4 gene is approximately 6.7 kb, too large to be delivered by AAV. There are currently no ongoing genetic medicine trials for Stargardt disease. The goal of treatment in Stargardt disease is to preserve vision by correcting ABCA4 expression in enough photoreceptors and RPE cells to halt the progressive loss of these cells that would otherwise occur.
Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to:

● | deliver to photoreceptors and RPE cells to halt progressive loss in cells and preserve vision;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | protect photoreceptors and RPE cells through expression of normal ABCA4, resulting in clearance of bis-retinoid byproducts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | drive the appropriate level of ABCA4 expression in photoreceptors and RPE cells utilizing a native ABCA4 promoter and native regulation of expression;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain normal macular vision and visual acuity when given to earlier-diagnosed patients; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | deliver the entire ABCA4 gene in a single gene therapy vector, thereby increasing efficacy relative to dual AAV approaches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps
We plan to continue our lead optimization in 2022 for this program. 
Lebers Congenital Amaurosis Type 10 (LCA10)
Overview
LCA10 is the most common genetic cause of childhood vision loss. There are approximately 2,200 patients with LCA10 in the United States and 3,400 patients in the European Union. It is a severe, autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy due to a mutation in the CEP290 protein that is expressed in and required for proper functioning of retinal photoreceptors. LCA10 causes blindness or severe vision loss, often from birth or within the first year of life.
Current approaches and limitations
There are no approved therapies for LCA10. Several therapeutic programs are in clinical development for LCA10, including a splicing oligonucleotide given episodically by intravitreal injection and a gene editing approach. Both approaches address only a subset of LCA10 patients, specifically those with a CEP290 mutation amenable to splicing alteration, which makes up approximately 60% of the population. CEP290 is a large gene of 7.4 kb, which exceeds the 4.7 kb payload capacity of AAV. No single approach has been able to address the many mutations that cause LCA10.

45



Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to:

● | deliver directly to the retina;
--+--------------------------------


● | treat patients irrespective of their CEP290 mutation;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | utilize ctLNP to specifically deliver CEP290 to photoreceptors and not to retinal glial and immune cells, thereby potentially increasing the safety, tolerability and durability of transgene expression;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enable single-dose therapy delivered subretinally, which may increase efficacy and compliance when compared, for example, to episodic intravitreal delivery; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | treat infants and children to halt further decline of and restore vision.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps
We plan to continue our lead optimization in 2022 for this program.
Wet age-related macular degeneration (Wet AMD)
Overview
Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss occurring in approximately 10 million people in the United States. Wet AMD is the most severe form, characterized by neovascularization of the retina, leading to significant loss in visual acuity and rapid progression to blindness. There are approximately 1.2 million patients with wet AMD in the United States and over 2.5 million patients in the European Union. Wet AMD is most common in individuals over the age of 50, with increasing incidence every decade thereafter.
Current approaches and limitations
Passive administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, mAbs are an established therapy for patients with wet AMD. Anti-VEGF therapy, such as EYLEA (aflibercept), is effective in slowing the loss of visual acuity in patients with wet AMD. However, the frequency of intravitreal administration is a barrier to adherence and to widespread adoption.
AAV gene therapy to establish intra-ocular expression of anti-VEGF molecules is in early clinical development, either by subretinal or intravitreal delivery. It is unclear today if these therapies will generate sufficient expression of anti-VEGF in the retina. If successful, the scale limitations of AAV may present additional challenges to providing therapy for a substantial proportion of wet AMD patients.
Our approach
Our genetic medicine approach aims to:

● | deliver intravitreally to enable retinal cells to express and secrete an anti-VEGF molecule;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide a durable and sustained level of expression of anti-VEGF, which may enhance regression of neovascularization and improve visual acuity and may enable administration only a few times over the life of a patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | define when repeat therapy would be indicated to optimally preserve the retina.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

46



In order to establish a baseline for the biodistribution of ctLNP in the eye, we administered mRNA-luciferase intravitreally at two doses of 0.2µg and 0.6µg using our ctLNP delivery system. As shown in the figure below, this resulted in luciferase expression in the retina.
Expression after intravitreal administration of mRNA-luciferase using ctLNP
We have generated several anti-VEGF mAb ceDNA constructs and have shown that these constructs result in high levels of anti-VEGF mAb levels in the blood after hydrodynamic intravenous delivery.
Next steps
We aim to combine these constructs with ctLNP to achieve intravitreal delivery of relevant antibody levels in the retina. We plan to continue our research for this program in 2022.
Expansion opportunities and early research
We plan to expand our portfolio by pursuing additional programs in rare and prevalent diseases of the skeletal muscle, oncology and the CNS by developing discrete ctLNPs, each engineered to reach a specific tissue. Additionally, we are conducting early research into the development of potential mRNA-based vaccines and ceDNA-based vaccines, in each case, using our proprietary ctLNPs.
Vaccines
We plan to deploy our ctLNPs that are optimized for vaccine applications for both mRNA and ceDNA cargo. We believe we can effectively use mRNA as a vaccine cargo to elicit high binding and neutralizing antibodies for a given antigen. Additionally, we believe ceDNA as a vaccine cargo may be used to improve responses of immune cells, including cytotoxic T cells, and/or to improve memory responses and durability of protection. Finally, ceDNA as a cargo for vaccine applications offers opportunities to create formulations stable at ambient temperatures due to the chemical stability of ceDNA, which could have implications for worldwide distribution.
Oncology
We plan to develop the use of ceDNA to treat a variety of cancer indications. We believe that we can use distinct targeting ligands to deliver ceDNA specifically and efficiently to tumors and can utilize ceDNA to express high levels of relevant proteins within the tumor. For example, we believe after systemic delivery and efficient uptake by tumors, the expression of checkpoint inhibitors and particular cytokines encoded by the ceDNA may have both direct anti-tumor activity and may stimulate the immune system to respond to and attack tumor cells. Many of the genes that we can express within tumors have limited efficacy and substantial safety and tolerability issues when given systemically. The key attribute of this approach is the ability to drive efficient and selective uptake of ceDNA within tumors and then local, high concentrations of relevant anti-tumor agents.

47



Skeletal muscle
There are a variety of genetic muscle disorders, including muscular dystrophies, that may be treated by efficient and systemic genetic medicine to skeletal muscle. We are currently developing a ctLNP utilizing a targeting ligand to deliver ceDNA specifically to skeletal muscle.
We believe this approach would have several benefits for rare monogenic diseases of the skeletal muscle, including:

● | early treatment, near the onset of disease, before inflammation and fibrosis progressively replace muscle fibers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delivery of full-length of defective skeletal muscle genes, which are often very large as is the case, for example, for dystrophin, the gene responsible for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, and genes that form the sarcoglycan complex, which are responsible for various forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | efficient delivery of the gene of interest to enough muscle fibers to change the course of disease;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sufficient expression within transduced muscle fibers to allow for normal constitution of the skeletal muscle fibers during growth and development; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | keeping up with patients’ needs over time through redosing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

We have identified a number of potential ligands for skeletal muscle and have been able to conjugate peptide-based ligands to ctLNP that have enhanced uptake into a differentiated skeletal muscle cell line, or myocyte, in vitro. These peptide-based ligands target known receptors, such as the transferrin receptor that is present on the surface of skeletal muscle. ctLNPs that include these peptide-based ligands on the surface of the particle have demonstrated high levels of uptake in muscle cells in culture. We have observed this in our in vitro studies where red dye was added to the ctLNP to enable quantification of uptake into these cells, as shown in the figure below. We are pursuing muscle-targeted ctLNPs for in vivo, systemic administration to target skeletal muscle and replace missing or defective genes, such as dystrophin in the case of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
ctLNP targeting skeletal muscle using peptide ligand

48



Enhanced uptake in c2c12 myocytes
LNPs are one of the most advanced non-viral delivery solutions for nucleic acid therapeutics. We have built on the attributes of the second generation of clinical LNPs, which include improved tolerability through utilization of biodegradable lipids. Specifically, we have engineered our ctLNP to allow for active targeting of specific cell types in vivo. Targeted delivery of DNA in vivo without incurring innate immune reactions has long been a challenge in the genetic medicine field. The profile of our ctLNP has led to further improvements in tolerability, increased delivery efficiency and application to tissues beyond liver and immune cells. Our ctLNP delivery system has shown in vitro proof of concept for skeletal muscle. We believe there are many diseases in the skeletal muscle with unmet need such as DMD, myotonic dystrophy, limb girdle dystrophies and fascioscapulohumeral dystrophies, which we may pursue in the future.
CNS
We plan to explore the use of ceDNA to correct disorders of the CNS. The work we are doing with local delivery in the retina to photoreceptors may inform expansion into the CNS, beginning for example with focal epilepsies, in which expression of a novel gene within a specific region of neurons may stop the abnormal seizures. One such example is Dravet syndrome, an epilepsy disorder that begins in infancy or early childhood usually caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the SCN1A gene. Another example is MPSII, or Hunter syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency in iduronate sulfatase resulting in both somatic (liver, bone and visceral organs) and CNS accumulation of toxic glycosaminoglycans.
Manufacturing 
We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee all internal and contracted manufacturing and testing activities. Relying on these personnel, we have developed RES, our novel, next-generation rapid enzymatic approach to manufacture ceDNA that does not rely on Sf9 cells. Instead, RES uses enzymes to convert plasmid and synthetic oligonucleotides DNA into ceDNA, similar to the current high-capacity methods used to manufacture mRNA vaccines. RES has consistently yielded highly pure ceDNA, reduced ceDNA variability, and shortened our ceDNA production cycle time from 28 days to one day. We expect that scaling RES may enable us to manufacture our potential drug candidates in a cost-effective manner and to expand access to patients with prevalent diseases that require hundreds of millions of doses, on a sustainable basis, and have transitioned all of our portfolio programs to RES. 
In July 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Zinc II PropCo 2020, LLC to build out an approximately 104,000 square foot current cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. The facility, expected to be operational in 2023, is intended for ceDNA manufacturing utilizing RES for drug substance manufacturing and ctLNP production resulting in cGMP-compliant clinical and initial commercial supply. In addition, the new facility is designed to provide expanded capacity for research production and process development activities. We plan to invest up to $45 million in the build-out of the new manufacturing facility over the next two years. We plan to continue to rely on CDMOs during and after construction to provide redundancy and secure additional ceDNA supply.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements. These regulations govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our systems and contractors are required to comply with these regulations and are assessed through regular monitoring and formal audits.

49



Drug substance
We believe that the ceDNA drug substance requirements for our programs can be met by a variety of domestic and international contractors with standard biological manufacturing equipment. We have established a cGMP-ready process at the 200-liter scale, which we have transferred to our drug substance CDMOs to supply ceDNA drug substance for IND-enabling studies, clinical trials and early commercial activities. To ensure supply chain continuity, we have also established service agreements with additional suppliers to afford redundancy and flexibility in scaling. We have access rights to a biologics facility at one of our CDMOs that we believe could fully support multiple clinical programs if and when we advance our programs into clinical trials, as well as the early phases of commercialization.
We have invested in technical expertise and internal capabilities to optimize and develop the ceDNA drug substance process and to provide technical management and quality oversight for our process transfers to CDMOs.
Future ceDNA drug substance processes may require additional manufacturing capabilities, which may be addressed by either expanding our capabilities with existing contractors or establishing manufacturing supply relationships with new contract manufacturers. These changes in processes may also require new supply chain agreements with CDMOs that specialize in raw material manufacturing.
Drug product
Our drug product is ceDNA formulated with ctLNP. We believe that our drug product requirements can be met by a variety of domestic and international CDMOs. We have selected a subset of experienced organizations familiar with the specific operations that our current drug product processes require. We have established a service agreement with one of these CDMOs and have also engaged with suppliers for key components of our ctLNP delivery system.
We have invested in technical expertise and internal capabilities to optimize and develop the drug product process and to provide technical management and quality oversight for our process transfers to CDMOs. We have transitioned our drug product process from research-scale using microfluidics to standard clinical-scale equipment supporting cGMP operations for other established LNP-based modalities. These scaled systems have generated representative and well-characterized drug product that we have used in our preclinical studies. Additionally, as with our drug substance processes, progress on analytics has allowed us to leverage insights into our delivery system to upgrade and characterize purity and homogeneity. We plan to continue to implement process changes to improve purity and yield.
Intellectual property 
We strive to protect our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms, product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture that we believe are important to our business, including by obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent and other intellectual property rights for the foregoing in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our confidential information and know-how and other aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success depends in part on our ability to:

● | obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patent and other intellectual property rights for our commercially important technology, inventions and improvements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other confidential information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain and maintain licenses to use and exploit intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50




● | defend against challenges and assertions by third parties challenging the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights, or our rights in our intellectual property, or asserting that the operation of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates their intellectual property rights.

Patent portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we own approximately 47 patent application families related to our business, including 10 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications and 17 PCT applications that have entered the national stage in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan (one of which is jointly owned with UMass), and we exclusively license one patent application family, which includes issued patents in each of the United States, Europe and Russia, allowed patent applications in Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, and pending national stage applications in several other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, and Singapore. We also non-exclusively license one patent application family, which includes issued patents in each of the United States, Australia and Israel and national stage patent applications in several other jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. In addition, we own approximately 23 U.S. provisional patent applications within the priority year. Currently, all wholly-owned patent applications covering any of our programs or technology, including the ceDNA platform, ctLNP delivery system and manufacturing processes are pending and have not been allowed or granted. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our programs and technology, including our ceDNA construct, ctLNP delivery system and manufacturing process as further described below. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued from national stage filings of our owned or exclusively in-licensed patent applications and any U.S. patents issued from non-provisional applications we may file in connection with our provisional patent applications would be scheduled to expire on various dates from 2037 through 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees.
ceDNA construct
As of December 31, 2021, we own approximately 29 patent application families, including four pending PCT patent applications and ten PCT applications that have entered the national stage in the United States and a number of jurisdictions outside the United States (one of which is jointly owned with UMass and one of which is jointly owned with Vir Biotechnology), and we exclusively license from UMass and Voyager one patent family, which has been granted in the United States, Europe and Russia, allowed in Japan, South Korea and South Africa, and pending in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, and Singapore. These issued patents and pending patent applications cover various aspects of our ceDNA construct, including ceDNA construct variants, certain disease-targeted ceDNA compositions and methods of use. We have also non-exclusively licensed one patent application family from the NIH and the Institut de Myologie, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Inserm Transfert SA, which we refer to as the French Institutions, which includes issued patents in each of the United States, Australia and Israel and national stage patent applications in other jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, which cover our ceDNA construct, certain disease-targeted ceDNA compositions and methods of use. In addition, we own approximately 16 U.S. provisional patent applications within the priority year, which cover ceDNA construct variants, general applications of the ceDNA construct technology and certain properties of the construct, specific disease-targeted ceDNA compositions and methods of use. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued from the pending U.S. or foreign non-provisional patent applications or from non-provisional applications we may file in connection with the pending provisional patent applications would be scheduled to expire on various dates from 2038 through 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees.
ctLNP delivery system
As of December 31, 2021, we own approximately 15 patent application families, including five pending PCT patent applications and five PCT applications that have entered the national stage in the United States and a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, and approximately six U.S. provisional patent applications within the priority year with respect to our ctLNP delivery system, including certain lipid and lipid nanoparticle compositions and combinations with ceDNA and/or targeting agents and methods of use. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued from the pending U.S. or 

51



foreign non-provisional patent applications or from any non-provisional applications we may file in connection with these provisional patent applications would be scheduled to expire on various dates from 2038 through 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees.
Manufacturing processes
As of December 31, 2021, we own approximately three patent application families, including two PCT applications that have entered the national stage in the United States and a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, and one U.S. provisional patent application within the priority year with respect to our ceDNA manufacturing processes. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued from the pending U.S. or foreign non-provisional patent applications or from any non-provisional applications we may file in connection with the provisional patent application would be scheduled to expire on various dates from 2039 through 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees.
Patent prosecution
A PCT patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file one or more national stage patent applications within 30 months, 31 months or 32 months of the PCT application’s priority date, depending on the jurisdiction, in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our PCT patent application and any potential patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such PCT patent application. Moreover, a provisional patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent. A provisional patent application may serve as a priority filing for a non-provisional patent application we file within 12 months of such provisional patent application. If we do not timely file non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our existing provisional patent applications and any potential patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications.
While we intend to timely file additional provisional patent applications and national stage and non-provisional patent applications relating to our PCT patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents. If we do not successfully obtain patent protection, or if the scope of the patent protection we or our licensors obtain with respect to our product candidates or technology, including our ceDNA constructs, ctLNP delivery system or manufacturing processes is not sufficiently broad, we will be unable to prevent others from using our technology or from developing or commercializing technology and products similar or identical to ours or other similar competing products and technologies. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our technology, inventions and improvements, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of patent term adjustments and regulatory-related patent term extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular jurisdiction and the validity and enforceability of the patent. No consistent policy regarding the scope of patent claims allowable in the field of genetic therapy has emerged in the United States. Moreover, patent laws and related enforcement in various jurisdictions outside of the United States are uncertain and may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Changes in the patent laws and rules, whether by legislation, judicial decisions or regulatory interpretation, in the United States and other jurisdictions may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and obtain, maintain, defend and enforce our patent rights, and could therefore affect the value of our business.
The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is evolving and has many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents and other intellectual property that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our platforms and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our patent rights may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, invalidated or ruled unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop third parties from marketing and commercializing related platforms or product candidates or limit the term of patents that cover 

52



our platforms and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against third parties with similar technology, and third parties may independently develop similar technologies. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any competitive advantage provided by the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates and intellectual property rights related to the foregoing, please see the section entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
Patent term extensions
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the jurisdictions in which they are obtained. In most jurisdictions in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of the first non-provisional patent application to which the patent claims priority. However, the term of U.S. patents may be extended or adjusted for delays incurred due to compliance with FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, in the United States, a patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. For more information on patent term extensions, see “Business—Government regulation—Patent term restoration and extension”. In the future, if and when any product candidates we may develop receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those product candidates. Moreover, we intend to seek patent term adjustments and extensions for any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where such adjustments and extensions are available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such adjustments and extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such adjustments and extensions.
Trade secrets
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information to strengthen our competitive position. We take steps to protect and preserve our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information and prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the foregoing, including by entering into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with parties who have access to our trade secrets or other confidential and proprietary information, such as employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, contract research and manufacturing organizations, sponsored researchers and other advisors, at the commencement of their employment, consulting or other relationships with us. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, to guard against any misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information by third parties.
Despite these efforts, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide any assurances that all of the foregoing non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements have been duly executed, and any of the counterparties to such agreements may breach them and disclose our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information. Although we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information, they may be inadequate, our agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Moreover, to the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to our rights in any know-how or inventions arising out of such work. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”

License agreements
We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We consider the following license agreements to be material to our business.
License agreement with the National Institutes of Health
In February 2017, we entered into a license agreement with the NIH, which was amended in July 2019 to include the French Institutions as licensors. Pursuant to the amended agreement, or the NIH Agreement, NIH and the French Institutions granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive license under a patent application family related to our ceDNA construct. This patent application family includes national stage patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe and Japan, and issued patents in each of the United States, Australia, China and Israel. The issued patents and any future patents issued from the pending patent applications would be scheduled to expire on various dates from March 2032 through October 2032, without taking into account any possible extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees. The non-exclusive license confers the right to make and have made, research and have researched, use and have used, sell and have sold, offer to sell and import products and to practice processes, in each case, covered by the licensed patents and patent applications, for the treatment, prevention or palliation of any human disease or condition.
Under the NIH Agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the licensed products and processes are utilized and made available to the public on reasonable terms, including pursuing commercially reasonable broad international patient accessibility for licensed gene therapy products for the treatment of rare diseases, in accordance with an agreed upon commercial development plan for gene therapy-based human therapeutics and certain performance milestone events. Unless terminated earlier, the NIH Agreement remains in effect until the last to expire of the licensed patent rights on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. NIH and the French Institutions may terminate the NIH Agreement if we fail to perform our material obligations, including but not limited to our failure to meet the applicable performance milestones despite using commercially reasonable efforts, and have not remediated such deficiency within a specified time period. NIH and the French Institutions can terminate the NIH Agreement in the event we become insolvent, file a petition in bankruptcy, have such a petition filed against us, or determine to file a petition in bankruptcy. In addition, NIH and the French Institutions may terminate the NIH Agreement in the event of a material breach by us and failure to cure such breach within a certain period of time. We can voluntarily terminate the NIH Agreement with prior notice to NIH and the French Institutions.
As part of the NIH Agreement, we agreed to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones up to a maximum aggregate total of $350,000 for each licensed product, as well as a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products. These royalty obligations last on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent rights covering such licensed product in such country. In addition, if we sublicense rights under the NIH Agreement, we are required to pay a high single-digit percent of the sublicense revenue to NIH. Additionally, under the NIH Agreement, we may be required to reimburse the French Institutions for a portion of certain past and ongoing patent related expenses, including expenses associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents and patent applications. As of December 31, 2021, there have been no invoiced expenses related to these reimbursable costs.
License Agreement with the University of Massachusetts
In June 2017, we entered into a license agreement with UMass pursuant to which UMass granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under a patent application family related to our ceDNA construct, which has pending national stage patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. In June 2020 Voyager became a joint owner with UMass of the licensed patent application family, and we entered into an amendment to the UMass Agreement under which UMass, on behalf of Voyager, expanded the license granted to us to include an exclusive license to Voyager’s rights in the licensed patent application family, subject to Voyager’s retained non-exclusive rights to practice and exploit the licensed patent application family solely for its AAV gene therapy products. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued from the pending 

54



licensed U.S. or foreign patent applications would be scheduled to expire in March 2037, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees. The exclusive license confers the right to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, offer for sale, sell and import products and practice and have practiced processes, in each case, covered by the patent application family.
Unless terminated earlier, our license agreement with UMass, as amended, which we refer to as the UMass Agreement, will continue until the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents. UMass may terminate the UMass Agreement if we fail to perform our material obligations, including but not limited to our failure to meet the applicable performance milestones despite using commercially reasonable efforts, and have not remediated such deficiency within a specified time period or negotiated a revised performance timeline. UMass can terminate the UMass Agreement if we fail to make any payments within a specified period after receiving written notice of such failure, or in the event of a material breach by us and failure to cure such breach within a certain period of time, provided that, if we fail to make payments due under the UMass Agreement more than a certain number of times, UMass may terminate the agreement immediately without any cure period. We can voluntarily terminate the UMass Agreement with prior notice to UMass.
Under the UMass Agreement, we agreed to use diligent efforts to develop the licensed products and introduce them into the commercial market and make them reasonably available to the public thereafter. Specifically, we agreed to achieve regulatory approval for and commercially launch at least one licensed product in the U.S. by certain specified dates.
As part of the UMass Agreement, we have issued to UMass 125,677 shares of our common stock. In addition, we may be obligated to make milestone payments up to $1,143,750 per licensed product that are contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones, as well as low single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. If we sublicense our rights under the UMass Agreement, we are required to pay a low-to-mid single-digit percentage of the license revenue to UMass, which will vary depending on when the sublicense agreement to a third party was executed. Royalty obligations under the UMass Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country. As of December 31, 2021, we have paid the first milestone to UMass for the issuance of the first patent in the licensed patent application family, and we have recorded no royalty or other milestone liabilities under the UMass Agreement.
Competition 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally, and the genetic medicine field specifically, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, sharp competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in the field of genetic medicine, nucleic acid delivery and manufacturing provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
There are numerous companies that are selling or developing genetic medicines, including in indications for which we may develop our non-viral genetic medicines. These companies include viral gene therapy companies such as BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Homology Medicines, Inc., Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. and Hoffmann La Roche Ltd; gene editing companies such as CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., and Beam Therapeutics Inc.; and mRNA companies such as Moderna, Inc.
Many of our competitors, either independently or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites 

55



and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than products we may develop. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the successful of all any products we may develop are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and availability of reimbursement.
Government regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Licensure and regulation of biologics in the United States
In the United States, any product candidates we may develop would be regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and guidance. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including preclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.
The FDA must approve a product candidate for a therapeutic indication before it may be marketed in the United States. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:

● | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completion of the manufacture, under cGMP conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and its submission to the FDA as part of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

56




● | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the preclinical studies and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP, as applicable, and GCP, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies or other post-marketing commitments required by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical studies and investigational new drug application
Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a genetic medicine product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved new drug application, or NDA. In support of a request for an IND application, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND application, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND application. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical investigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects. 
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND application. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND application, all IND application requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND application, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND application or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including 

57



undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects. GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND application foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.
Additionally, genetic medicine clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the NIH also are potentially subject to review by a committee within the NIH’s Office of Science Policy called the Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee, or the NExTRAC. As of 2019, the charter of this review group has evolved to focus public review on clinical trials that cannot be evaluated by standard oversight bodies and pose unusual risks. With certain genetic medicine protocols, FDA review of or clearance to allow the IND to proceed could be delayed if the NExTRAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted.
Reporting clinical trial results
Under the PHSA, sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. The NIH’s final rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both the NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. 
Specifically, the PHSA grants the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the authority to issue a notice of noncompliance to a responsible party for failure to submit clinical trial information as required. The responsible party, however, is allowed 30 days to correct the noncompliance and submit the required information. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is also a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. In addition to civil monetary penalties, violations may also result in other regulatory action, such as injunction and/or criminal prosecution or disqualification from federal grants. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the HHS’s long delay in issuing final implementing regulations, those regulations have now been issued and the FDA did issue its first notice of noncompliance to a manufacturer in April 2021.
Expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.

58



There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, Fast Track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Human clinical trials in support of a BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from participants. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group may recommend continuation of the trial as planned, changes in trial conduct, or cessation of the trial at designated check points based on certain available data from the trial to which only the DSMB has access.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.

● | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

59




● | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. The failure to exercise due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued guidance on March 18, 2020, and has updated it periodically since that time to address the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic. The guidance sets forth a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical study report (or as a separate document) contingency measures implemented to manage the study, and any disruption of the study as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a list of all study participants affected by COVID-19-related study disruptions by a unique subject identifier and by investigational site, and a description of how the individual’s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the study, among other things. The FDA has indicated that it will continue to provide any necessary guidance to sponsors, clinical investigators, and research institutions as the public health emergency evolves.
Interactions with FDA during the clinical development program
Following the clearance of an IND application and the commencement of clinical trials, the sponsor will continue to have interactions with the FDA. Progress reports detailing the results of clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND application safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the occurrence of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. When clinical data is submitted to support marketing applications, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.

60



In addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program. Specifically, sponsors may meet with the FDA prior to the submission of an IND application, or pre-IND application meeting, at the end of a Phase 2 clinical trial, or EOP2 meeting, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted, or pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. Meetings at other times may also be requested. There are four types of meetings that occur between sponsors and the FDA. Type A meetings are those that are necessary for an otherwise stalled product development program to proceed or to address an important safety issue. Type B meetings include pre-IND application and pre-NDA/pre-BLA meetings, as well as Type B end of phase meetings, such as EOP2 meetings. A Type C meeting is any meeting other than a Type A or Type B meeting regarding the development and review of a product.
These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date with the FDA and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. For example, at an EOP2 meeting, a sponsor may discuss its Phase 2 clinical results and present its plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that it believes will support the approval of the new product. Such meetings may be conducted in person, via teleconference/videoconference or written response only with minutes reflecting the questions that the sponsor posed to the FDA and the FDA’s responses. The FDA has indicated that its responses, as conveyed in meeting minutes and advice letters, only constitute mere recommendations and/or advice made to a sponsor and, as such, sponsors are not bound by such recommendations and/or advice. Nonetheless, from a practical perspective, a sponsor’s failure to follow the FDA’s recommendations for design of a clinical program may put the program at significant risk of failure.
Pediatric Studies. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial pediatric study plan within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although the FDA has recently taken steps to limit what is considers abuse of this statutory exemption in the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, by announcing that is does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
Special regulations and guidance governing gene therapy products
We expect that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products will be applied to any product candidates we may develop. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient.

61



Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the OTAT and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The NIH, including the NExTRAC also advises the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging biotechnologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for gene therapy INDs, long-term follow-up after the administration of gene therapy products, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders, as well as draft guidance in January 2021 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although the FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe for potential delayed adverse effects in participants who have received investigational gene therapies with the duration of follow-up based on the potential for risk of such effects. For AAV vectors specifically, the FDA typically recommends that sponsors continue to monitor participants for potential gene therapy-related adverse events for up to a 5-year period. Other types of gene therapy or gene editing products may require longer follow up, potentially up to a maximum 15-year period.
Until 2019, most gene therapy clinical trials in the United States required pre-review by the predecessor of the NExTRAC before being approved by the IRBs and any local biosafety boards or being allowed to proceed by the FDA. In 2019, the NIH substantially eliminated the pre-review process and going forward, the review of gene therapy clinical trial protocols would be largely handled by local IRBs and institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, in addition to the FDA. Furthermore, in 2019, the NIH removed from public access the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System database, which previously contained substantial amounts of safety and other participant information regarding human gene therapy trials performed up to that time.
Compliance with cGMP requirements
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical 

62



records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.
Regulatory requirements governing manufacturing
The FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product. 
Acceptance and review of BLAs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, safety updates, patent information, abuse information and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug product and the safety, potency and purity of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The fee required for the submission and review of an application under the PDUFA is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2022, this application fee is approximately $3.1 million), and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2022 is more than $369,000 per eligible prescription product. These fees, of which the application fee may be waived for products with orphan drug designation, are typically adjusted annually, and exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor by that time whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, the FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA. In the event that the FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the applicant. Typically, an RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information or sections of required information; scientific incompleteness, such as omission of critical data, information or analyses needed to evaluate safety and efficacy or provide adequate directions for use; or inadequate content, presentation, or organization of information such that substantive and meaningful review is precluded. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the 

63



filing date for an application with “priority review”. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date.
In connection with its review of an application, the FDA will typically submit information requests to the applicant and set deadlines for responses thereto. The FDA will also conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND applications and GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant may incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Additionally, the FDA may refer an application, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS.
Decisions on BLAs
The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The term “substantial evidence” is defined under the FDCA as “evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the product involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the product will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.”
The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, the FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. This approach was subsequently endorsed by Congress in 1998 with legislation providing, in pertinent part, that “If [FDA] determines, based on relevant science, that data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, FDA may consider such data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence.” This modification to the law recognized the potential for the FDA to find that one adequate and well controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence, including supportive data outside of a controlled trial, is sufficient to establish effectiveness. In December 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance further explaining the studies that are needed to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness. It has not yet finalized that guidance. 

64



After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a CRL or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product’s safety and efficacy in the NDA or BLA. This assessment is also informed by other factors, including: the severity of the underlying condition and how well patients’ medical needs are addressed by currently available therapies; uncertainty about how the premarket clinical trial evidence will extrapolate to real-world use of the product in the post-market setting; and whether risk management tools are necessary to manage specific risks. In connection with this assessment, the FDA review team will assemble all individual reviews and other documents into an “action package,” which becomes the record for the FDA’s review. The FDA review team then issues a recommendation, and a senior FDA official makes a decision.
A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the applicant an additional six month extension to respond. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA has taken the position that a CRL is not final agency action making the determination subject to judicial review.
An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population and indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling; post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval; and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Under the Ensuring Innovation Act, which was signed into law in April 2021, the FDA must publish action packages summarizing its decisions to approve new drugs and biologics within 30 days of approval of such products. To date, CRLs are not publicly available documents.
Expedited review programs
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND application. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.

65



Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation.

● | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative medicine advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is an RMAT that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of an RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

None of these expedited programs changes the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.
Post-approval regulation
If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.

A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about a product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product recall, seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Although healthcare providers may prescribe products for uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, in their professional judgment, drug manufacturers are prohibited from soliciting, encouraging or promoting unapproved uses of a product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations that describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal 

67



fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
Finally, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such trials are conducted, the FDA may not approve any expansion of the labeled indications for use in a timely fashion, or at all. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements that are now assessed as program fees for certain approved drugs.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. In particular, the concept of what constitutes the “same drug” for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies, and the FDA has issued final guidance suggesting that it would not consider two gene therapy products to be different drugs solely based on minor differences in the transgenes or vectors within a given vector class. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or provide a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show 

68



clinical superiority applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by the FDA.
In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by the FDA.
Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of non-patent exclusivity that cover the product are extended by six months.
Regulatory exclusivity governing biologics
When a biological product is licensed for marketing by the FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring the FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the PPACA, was enacted in the United States and included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021. The FDA has also issued numerous guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and licensing biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars under the PHSA, including a draft guidance issued in November 2020 that seeks to provide additional clarity to manufacturers of interchangeable biosimilars.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for a product that is “biosimilar to” a previously approved biological product, which the statute refers to as a “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The biosimilar applicant may demonstrate that its product is biosimilar to the reference product on the basis of data from analytical studies, animal studies and one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find not only that the product is biosimilar to the reference product but also that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product such that the two products may be switched without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. Following approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product, the FDA may not grant interchangeability status for any second biosimilar until one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar product.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference product until 

69



four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, however, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws that address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Patent term restoration and extension
In the United States, a patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND application and the submission date of the BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Federal and state data privacy and security laws
There are multiple privacy and data security laws that may impact our business activities, in the United States and in other countries where we conduct trials or where we may do business in the future. These laws are evolving and may increase both our obligations and our regulatory risks in the future. In the health care industry generally, under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. HIPAA may apply to us in certain circumstances and may also apply to our business partners in ways that may impact our relationships with them. Our clinical trials will be regulated by HIPPA’s Common Rule, which also includes specific privacy-related provisions. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that may be applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. State attorneys general also have authority to enforce state privacy and security laws. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.
At the state level, California has enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, effective starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and individually identifiable health information. These provisions 

70



may apply to some of our business activities. In addition, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, already have passed state privacy laws and other states will likely be considering similar laws in the near future.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any product candidates we may develop, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
FDA approval of companion diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.
The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND application alone, or both an IND- and IDE-application.
In April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance that describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate. This guidance builds upon existing policy regarding the labeling of companion diagnostics. In its 2014 guidance, the FDA stated that if evidence is sufficient to conclude that the companion diagnostic is appropriate for use with a specific group of therapeutic products, the companion diagnostic’s intended use or indications for use should name the specific group of therapeutic products, rather than specific products. The 2020 guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by recommending that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors when determining whether their test could be developed, or the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)). 
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and 

71



import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require pre-notification marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For fiscal year 2022, the standard fee is $374,858 and the small business fee is $93,714.
Regulation and procedures governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a MAA and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical trial approval
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, but it has not yet become effective. The Clinical Trial Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all European Union member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (member states concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned European Union member states. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
The conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable, the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.

72



On January 1, 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the new Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. In late 2020, the EMA indicated that it plans to focus on the findings of a system audit; improving the usability, quality and stability of the clinical trial information system; and knowledge transfer to prepare users and their organizations for the new clinical trial system. The Clinical Trial Information System went live in January 2022 and will be fully implemented under a 3-year transition period.
Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
PRIME designation in the European Union
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Marketing authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union member states (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing 

73



authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA.
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
National Authorization Procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union member states, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

● | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union member state of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union member state and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The applicant may choose a European Union member state as the reference European Union member state to lead the scientific evaluation of the application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union member state (which acts as the reference member state), in accordance with the national procedures of that member state. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be progressively sought from other European Union member states in a procedure whereby the members concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization produced by the reference European Union member state.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the European Union member state of the European Economic Area, or the EEA, make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Conditional Approval
In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14–a Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/5 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the product candidate is intended for the treatment, prevention or medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases; (2) the product candidate is intended to meet unmet medical needs of patients; (3) a marketing authorization may be granted prior to submission of comprehensive clinical data provided that the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required; (4) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, and (5) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.

74



Specialized procedures for gene therapies
The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for gene therapy products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC includes specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Pediatric Studies
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are provided in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
Regulatory data protection in the European Union
In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Patent term extensions in the European Union and other jurisdictions
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained, which is described in detail below. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
Periods of authorization and renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To 

75



that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the European Union market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
Regulatory requirements after marketing authorization
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity.
Pediatric Exclusivity
If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all European Union member states, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the SPC.
Approval of companion diagnostic devices
In the European Union, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or SPRs, detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 

76



2017/745), or MDR, which came into force on May 26, 2021 and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with SPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Conformitè Europëenne mark of conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold. To demonstrate compliance with the SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the European Union for medical devices.
Separately, the regulatory authorities in the European Union also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746), which will become effective in May 2022. The new regulation will replace the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC. Manufacturers wishing to apply to a notified body for a conformity assessment of their in vitro diagnostic medical device have until May 2022 to update their technical documentation to meet the requirements and comply with the new, more stringent regulation. Once applicable, the regulation will, among other things: strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market; improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there was a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable by up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom, as the United Kingdom legislation now has the potential to diverge from European Union legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom in the long-term. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 at the completion of the transition period, which the Agency will update as the United Kingdom’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom government has already determined that it considers all European Union 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the European Union/EEA remain unaffected. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable European Union member states and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.

77



General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, any companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to any companion diagnostics.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable 

78



coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
If we obtain approval in the future to market in the United States any product candidates we may develop, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements.
Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; 

79



and the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government healthcare programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022, a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut remaining thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the PPACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new executive order that directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and 

80



strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and under the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
Pharmaceutical prices
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the prices of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the prices of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, the HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden Administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden Administration until January 1, 2023. 
On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The order directs the HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, the HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic pharmaceuticals, and increase transparency; and foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments. 
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit 

81



the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Human Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 150 employees, all of whom are full-time employees, including a total of 52 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, approximately 93 employees are engaged in research and development. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly talented individuals. Our programs cultivate employee engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion, growth and development while consistently providing competitive compensation and benefits. Our benefit programs are designed to meet the diverse needs of our employees and focus on promoting well-being across all aspects of their lives. These programs include healthcare, retirement planning, education planning, and extensive time off. 
To ensure our employees are consistently paid competitively, we perform a formal compensation benchmark analysis of our employees’ base salary, bonus potential, and equity awards twice per year and link annual bonuses to overall company performance. In addition to our compensation benchmarking analysis, we perform a gender pay gap analysis designed to ensure that women are paid equally to their male counterparts. Employees are paid based on our compensation philosophy, which includes paying employees competitively and at a rate consistent with an employee’s position, knowledge and skills. Our equity incentive plans are also designed to attract, retain and motivate our employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a safe work environment for our employees, we modified our normal operations, including, among other things, limiting the numbers of employees on-site to those whose presence is needed for their job activities. In the recent months, some employees have transitioned back to working on-site in conjunction with the implementation of additional safety and infection prevention measures. We continually monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and will take actions as may be required or recommended by federal, state or local government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other business partners. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to the pandemic, including with respect to our employees, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We also strive to make our company an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for each of our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We believe it is crucial to, and our directors and senior management strongly support, a no-tolerance stance for workplace harassment, biases and unethical behavior. All employees, including senior management, are required to abide by, review and confirm compliance to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other internal policies that outline our high expectations. Additionally, we promote opportunities for all employees to join our Acting for Justice and Women’s Forums, which support and promote certain mutual objectives of both us and our employees, including inclusion and diversity.
