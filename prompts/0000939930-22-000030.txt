Item 1. Business
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report") is being filed by Pyxus International, Inc. (the "Company," "Pyxus," "we," or "us"). The Company is the successor issuer to Old Holdco, Inc. ("Old Pyxus") and was incorporated as a Virginia corporation in August 2020 to facilitate the Restructuring described below. The terms the "Company," "Pyxus," "we," or "us" when used with respect to periods commencing prior to the effectiveness of the Plan (as defined below), refer to Old Pyxus, unless the context would indicate otherwise. As the context requires, the "Company," "Pyxus," "we" and "us" also includes the consolidated subsidiaries of Pyxus International, Inc.
On June 15, 2020 (the "Petition Date"), Old Pyxus (then named Pyxus International, Inc.) and its then subsidiaries Alliance One International, LLC, Alliance One North America, LLC, Alliance One Specialty Products, LLC and GSP Properties, LLC (collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions (the "Chapter 11 Cases") under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") to implement a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization to effectuate a financial restructuring (the "Restructuring") of Old Pyxus’ secured debt. On August 21, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order (the "Confirmation Order") confirming the Amended Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") filed by the Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases. On August 24, 2020, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms, and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. In connection with the satisfaction of the conditions to effectiveness as set forth in the Confirmation Order and the Plan, Old Pyxus completed a series of transactions pursuant to which the business assets and operations of Old Pyxus were vested in a new Virginia corporation, Pyxus Holdings, Inc., which is an indirect subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Confirmation Order and the Plan, at the effectiveness of the Plan, all outstanding shares of common stock, and rights to acquire the common stock, of Old Pyxus were cancelled and the shares of common stock of the Company were delivered to certain creditors of Old Pyxus. Other than our Chief Executive Officer, our Board of Directors does not include any of the individuals who served as directors of Old Pyxus at the time the Chapter 11 Cases were commenced or at the effectiveness of the Plan. These and other related matters are discussed in greater detail in "Note 3. Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11" to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," which is incorporated herein by reference. Cross references included in this Annual Report to "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" are to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report.
Company Overview
Pyxus is a trusted provider of responsibly sourced, independently verified, sustainable and traceable products and ingredients. Headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina, we contract with suppliers across five continents to help them produce sustainable, compliant crops. 
Historically, Pyxus’ core business has been as a tobacco leaf merchant, purchasing, processing, packing, storing and shipping tobacco to manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products throughout the world. Through our predecessor companies, we have a long operating history in the leaf tobacco industry with some customer relationships beginning in the early 1900s. Our core leaf tobacco operations continued to account for almost all of our revenues for the year ended March 31, 2022.
We are committed to responsible crop production that supports economic viability for the supplier, provides a safe working atmosphere for farmworkers and minimizes negative environmental impacts. Our agronomists maintain frequent contact with our contracted suppliers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. Throughout the entire production process, from seed through processing and final shipment, our SENTRI® traceability platform can provide clear visibility into how products are produced throughout the supply chain, supporting product integrity.
In an increasing number of markets, we also provide agronomy expertise for alternative crops. Our contracted tobacco supplier base often produces non-tobacco crops, utilizing the agronomic assistance that our team provides. Pyxus is working to find markets for these crops as part of our ongoing efforts to improve farmer livelihoods and the communities in which they live. 
Beginning in 2017, we undertook to diversify the Company's products and services. In support of this strategy, the Company made the following investments: 
E-liquids
•On April 2, 2018, we purchased a 51% interest in Humble Juice, LLC ("Humble Juice"), a manufacturer and distributor of flavored e-liquids.
•On August 21, 2017, the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Nicotine River, LLC ("Nicotine River"), a manufacturer, retailer and wholesale supplier of compounds used for e-liquid production, and on August 14, 2020, 
4 


the Company exchanged its 40% ownership interest in Nicotine River for an additional 14.3% interest in Humble Juice, then increasing the Company's ownership interest in Humble to 65.3%. 
Industrial hemp/CBD
•On December 18, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Criticality LLC ("Criticality"), a North Carolina-based industrial hemp company to engage in cannabidiol ("CBD") extraction and other applications for industrial hemp. On April 22, 2020, that subsidiary completed a purchase of the 60% interest in Criticality not owned by the subsidiary, and as a result Criticality became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxus. 
Legal cannabis in Canada
•On January 25, 2018, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired a 75% equity position in Canada’s Island Garden Inc. ("Figr East"). Figr East obtained license to produce and sell medicinal and adult-use cannabis in most of the provinces in the Canadian market. We acquired an additional 18% and 1.2% equity interest in Figr East on March 22, 2019 and October 15, 2019, respectively, increasing the ownership percentage to 94.2%. 
•On January 29, 2018, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired an 80% equity position in Figr Norfolk Inc. ("Figr Norfolk" and, together with Figr East "Figr"), formerly known as Goldleaf Pharm Inc., which obtained license to produce and sell medicinal and adult-use cannabis in most of the provinces in the Canadian market. 
As further discussed below, we have generally divested or ceased operating these businesses and have returned our focus to our leaf tobacco businesses.
Following the effectiveness of the Plan and the election of additional members of our Board of Directors in October 2020, our Board of Directors determined to exit the industrial hemp, CBD and Canadian cannabis businesses in light of the Company’s limited capital resources and the continuing capital requirements to develop and expand these early-stage businesses. In December 2020, the Company commenced actions to exit operations of the industrial hemp businesses, including the production and sale of products containing extracts of industrial hemp, including CBD products, by Criticality. Criticality’s CBD extraction facility has ceased operations.
On January 21, 2021, Figr Norfolk Inc. ("Figr Norfolk") and Figr Brands, Inc. ("Figr Brands"), which are indirect subsidiaries of the Company, and Canada’s Island Garden Inc. ("Figr East", and together with Figr Norfolk and Figr Brands, the "Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries"), which, prior to its sale on June 28, 2021 was an indirect subsidiary of the Company, applied for relief from their respective creditors pursuant to Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the "CCAA") in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "Canadian Court") in Ontario, Canada as Court File No. CV-21-00655373-00CL (the "CCAA Proceeding"). On January 21, 2021 (the "Order Date"), upon application by the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, the Canadian Court issued an order for creditor protection of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of the CCAA and the appointment of FTI Consulting Canada Inc. to serve as the Canadian Court-appointed monitor of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries during the pendency of the CCAA Proceeding (the "Monitor"). As a result of the commencement of the CCAA Proceeding and the appointment of the Monitor, and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries were deconsolidated from the Company's financial statements as of the Order Date. 
As a result of a sale process under an order issued by the Canadian Court in the CCAA Proceeding, the sale of Figr East and certain intangible assets of Figr Brands was completed on June 28, 2021 and the sale of assets of Figr Norfolk was completed on January 28, 2022. Pursuant to the CCAA Proceeding, the Company received funds in settlement of its debt claims with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries and did not receive any recovery with respect to its equity interest in the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. See "Note 5. CCAA Proceeding and Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries" and "Note 30. Subsequent Events" to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.
On November 23, 2021, the Company disposed of its ownership interests in Humble Juice, the Company's primary e-liquids business, in exchange for royalties on future revenue. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company's remaining e-liquids subsidiary, Twelfth State Brands LLC, which markets e-liquids under the Bantam trademark, suspended the sourcing of additional inventory and reduced staffing pending action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") on its applications to permit continued marketing of its remaining products.
Historically, the Company had nine operating segments that were organized by product category and geographic area and were aggregated into three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Leaf - North America, Leaf - Other Regions, and Other Products and Services. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company reevaluated its operating and reportable segments under ASC Topic 280 - Segment Reporting ("ASC 280") in response to the effectiveness of the Plan in August 2020, the appointment of a new Board of Directors during the seven months ended March 31, 2021, the outcomes achieved from cost savings and restructuring initiatives implemented during the five months ended August 31, 2020 and the seven months ended March 31, 2021, the Company's exit from its industrial hemp, CBD, and Canadian cannabis businesses during the seven months 
5 


ended March 31, 2021, and changes to business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this reevaluation, effective during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company has eight operating segments organized by geographic area and product category and are aggregated into one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Leaf. See "Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.
Leaf Tobacco Operations
Our leaf tobacco revenues are primarily comprised of sales of processed leaf tobacco and fees charged for processing and related services to manufacturers of tobacco products. Our leaf tobacco operations deal primarily in flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos that are used in international cigarette brands. 
We purchase tobacco on five continents and ship to customers globally. We primarily purchase tobacco directly from suppliers. In those instances, we assume the risk of matching the quantities and grades required by our customers to the entire crop we must purchase under contract. 
Our arrangements with suppliers vary depending on our predictions of future supply and demand, local historical practice and availability of capital. In some locales, we purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and other products related to growing tobacco, which represent prepaid inventory, and issue them to suppliers with whom we have purchase contracts. The suppliers then utilize these inputs to grow tobacco, which we are contractually obligated to purchase if they meet our specifications. The advances of inputs for the current crop generally include the original cost of the inputs plus a mark-up and interest as it is earned. Where contractually permitted, we charge interest to the suppliers during the period the current crop advance is outstanding. We generally advance inputs at a price greater than our cost, which results in a mark-up on the inputs. We account for our advances to tobacco suppliers using a cost accumulation model, which results in us reporting our advances at the lower of cost or recoverable amounts excluding the mark-up and interest. The mark-up and interest on our advances are recognized when the tobacco is delivered as a decrease in our cost of the current crop. Upon delivery of tobacco, part of the purchase price paid to the supplier is paid in cash and part through a reduction of the advance balance. The advances applied to the delivery are reclassified out of advances and into unprocessed inventory. We advance inputs only to suppliers with whom we have purchase contracts. Under longer-term arrangements with suppliers, we may advance or guarantee financing on suppliers' capital assets, which are also recovered through the delivery of tobacco to us by our suppliers.
As a result of various factors including weather, not all suppliers are able to settle the entire amount of advances through delivery of tobacco in a given crop year. Throughout the crop cycle, we monitor events that may impact the suppliers’ ability to deliver tobacco. If we determine we will not be able to recover the original cost of the advances with deliveries of the current crop, or future crop deliveries, the unit cost of tobacco actually received is increased when unrecoverable costs are within a normal range or expensed immediately when they are above a normal range. The normal range is based on our historical results. We account for the unrecoverable costs in this manner to ensure only costs within a normal range are capitalized in inventory and costs that are above a normal range are expensed immediately as current period charges.
We process tobacco to meet each customer's specifications as to quality, yield, chemistry, particle size, moisture content and other characteristics. Unprocessed tobacco is a semi-perishable commodity. The processing of leaf tobacco facilitates shipping and prevents spoilage and is an essential service to our customers because the quality of processed leaf tobacco substantially affects the quality of the manufacturer’s end product. Accordingly, we have located our production facilities in proximity to our principal sources of tobacco. We process tobacco in Company-owned and third-party facilities around the world, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Macedonia, Malawi, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, United States, and Zimbabwe. These facilities encompass all leading export locations of flue-cured, burley and oriental tobaccos. After processing, whole leaves, bundles, strips or stems, and scrap where applicable, are separately packed in cases, bales, cartons or hogsheads for storage and shipment. Packed flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco generally is transported in the country of origin by truck or rail, and exports are moved by ship. 
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the seven months ended March 31, 2021, the five months ended August 31, 2020, and the year ended March 31, 2020, approximately 64%, 60%, 68%, and 67% of our total purchases for the respective period were from Brazil, China, Turkey, and the Africa Region. We have entered into contracts, joint ventures and other arrangements for the purchase of tobacco grown in substantially all other countries that produce export-quality flue-cured and burley tobacco.
Key Customers
In our leaf tobacco business, our primary customers are major consumer tobacco product manufacturers. Refer to "Note 29. Segment Information" to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding customers, and their respective affiliates, that account for more than 10% of our annual revenues. Pyxus delivered approximately 33% of its tobacco sales to customers in Europe, approximately 17% to customers in China, and approximately 13% to customers in the United States for year ended March 31, 2022. The remaining sales of leaf tobacco are to customers located in Asia, Africa, and other geographic regions of the world.

Competition
Leaf tobacco industry competition is based primarily on the price charged for products and services as well as the merchant's ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing, residue compliance and financing of tobacco. The Company is one of only two global, publicly held leaf tobacco merchants. We hold a leading position in most major tobacco growing regions in the world, including the principal export markets for flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco. In addition to the primary global independent leaf tobacco merchants, there are a number of other independent global, regional or national competitors. Local independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead also supply cigarette manufacturers. 
Seasonality
The purchasing and processing activities of our leaf tobacco business are seasonal. Tobacco purchases vary by market and tobacco variety. Flue-cured tobacco grown in North America is purchased, processed, and marketed generally during the five-month period beginning in July and ending in November. North American burley tobacco is purchased, processed, and marketed usually from late November through January or February. Tobacco grown in South America is usually purchased, processed, and marketed from January through July and in Africa from April through September. Other tobacco markets around the world have similar purchasing periods, although at different times of the year. During the purchasing, processing and marketing seasons, inventories of unprocessed tobacco, inventories of redried tobacco, and trade accounts receivable normally reach peak levels in succession. Current liabilities, particularly advances from customers, and short-term notes payable to banks, normally reach their peak in this period as a means of financing the seasonal expansion of current assets. At March 31, the end of our fiscal year, the seasonal components of our working capital reflect primarily the operations related to foreign-grown tobacco.
Track and Trace Technology
In connection with its leaf tobacco operations, the Company uses a proprietary "track and trace" system, which we have branded as the SENTRISM platform, which we believe provides transparency into the lifecycle of agricultural products by monitoring information and obtaining data related to the growth, cultivation, harvest, processing, formulation, testing, and release of individual batches of products. By obtaining data on products at each stage of the supply chain, SENTRISM permits proactive decision-making for both the Company and its leaf tobacco customers. The key features of the SENTRISM platform include:
•Product Tracking: Data collection and tracking at various stages in the product lifecycle permits customers and consumers to gain an understanding of where products originate from, how they were produced, and the product testing data in order to understand ingredients and the product journey. 
•Control and Visibility: With access to increased data regarding the supply chain, we are able to monitor quality control at various points in the product route to market.
•Sustainability Commitments: SENTRISM incorporates visibility into the practices and procedures of the product supply chain.
•Lot Number Tracking: We are able to track specific products through the manufacturing process by lot number with full visibility to our customers. This permits us and our customers to discover more about the product, its origin and other information relevant to quality control and product transparency.
•Agronomic Services: SENTRISM utilizes an experienced team of agronomists to track data and insights regarding growing practices.
Regulation
