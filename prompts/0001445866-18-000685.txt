ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “GB” and “GB Sciences” refers solely to GB Sciences, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and all references to “the Company,” “we”, “us” or “our” in this Annual Report refers to GB Sciences and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
The Company seeks to be an innovative technology and solution company that converts the cannabis plant into medicines, therapies and treatments for a variety of ailments. The Company is developing and utilizing state of the art technologies in plant biology, cultivation and extraction techniques, combined with biotechnology, and plans to produce consistent and measurable medical-grade cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabinoid therapies.
 
We seek to become a trusted producer of consistent and efficacious medicinal strains and products, combining both cannabinoids and terpenes, which we intend to market in those states within the United States and in other countries where the sale of medical cannabis products are permitted. In addition, subject to obtaining Food and Drug Administrative (FDA) certification, we intend to market our cannabinoid-based drug discoveries on a world-wide basis.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 4, 2001, under the name “Flagstick Venture, Inc.” On March 28, 2008, stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common stock approved changing our then name “Signature Exploration and Production Corp.” as our business model had changed. 
 
On March 13, 2014, we entered into a definitive assets purchase agreement for the acquisition of assets, including the Growblox™ cultivation technology which resulted in a change in our corporate name on April 4, 2014, from Signature Exploration and Production Corporation to Growblox Sciences, Inc. 

1

Effective December 12, 2016, the Company amended its Certificate of Corporation pursuant to shareholder approval as reported in the Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2016. Pursuant to the amendment the Company’s name was changed from Growblox Sciences, Inc. to GB Sciences, Inc. 
 
Effective April 8, 2018, Shareholders of the Company approved the change in corporate domicile from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada and increase in the number of authorized capital shares from 250,000,000 to 400,000,000.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
GB Sciences intends to operate as an intellectual property company that will conduct its business through its subsidiaries. GB Sciences intends to own all patents and related technologies developed by it and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Company owns and will seek to own majority interests in each of its existing and future operating subsidiaries.
 
Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near-term profitability, we cultivate and dispense cannabis for medical and recreational purposes in Nevada. Additionally, we intend to cultivate and dispense cannabis in other states which permit such sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing licenses.
 
Drug Discovery and Development of Novel Cannabis-Based Therapies
 
Through its wholly owned subsidiary Growblox Life Sciences (GBLS”), the Company has conducted ground-breaking research embracing the complexity of the whole plant led by Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, the Company’s Chief Science Officer, and Dr. Helen Turner, Vice President of Innovation and Dean of the Science and Technology Department at Chaminade University. Small-Howard and Turner posited that complex mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes that are derived from native mixtures in the cannabis plant, but with precise optimizations, would provide more targeted and effective treatments for specific disease conditions than either single cannabinoids or whole plant formulations. They developed a rapid screening and assaying system which tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes in vitro against cell-based models of disease. This process identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, neuropathic pain and chronic pain. 
 
GB Sciences’ drug discovery process combines high throughput screening of tens of thousands of combinations of compounds derived from specific chemovars of the cannabis plant in well-established cellular models of diseases and a proprietary network pharmacology algorithm for the prediction of complex therapeutic mixtures that the Company spent two-and-a-half-years training and testing against cell assay data. This combined approach to drug discovery increases research efficiency and accuracy. Screening of cannabis-based mixtures for drug discovery involves the testing of specific combinations of plant chemicals from many naturally occurring cannabis chemovars and the use of live models for these diseases that have been well established by other researchers. First, the Company finds chemovars that show some therapeutic activity, and then refines these natural mixtures to optimize their effectiveness in cellular assays by removing compounds that do not act synergistically with the others in the mixtures. The Company also use its internally-validated GBSci Network Pharmacology Platform to prioritize and eliminate some potential combinations.
 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allows complex mixtures to be claimed as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, and GB Sciences has a series of patents containing cannabis-derived complex mixtures that act as therapeutic agents for specific disease categories, as described below. The Company’s patents are protected whether the individual compounds are derived from the cannabis plant, another plant, synthetically produced, or derived from a combination of sources for the individual chemical compounds in these mixtures.

Partnering Strategy
 
The Company runs a lean drug development program and minimizes expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses (such as lab and diagnostic equipment), through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Through these research and development agreements, the Company has created a virtual pipeline for the further development of novel medicines extracted from the cannabis plant. The partners bring both expertise and infrastructure at a reasonable cost to the life sciences program. GB Sciences has also negotiated with these partners to keep 100% of the ownership of the IP within GBLS for original patent filings.
 The Company currently has active and on-going research agreements with the following institutions covering the indicated areas of research:
 ·
Chaminade University: Broad-based research program to support the drug discovery platform that has yielded all of GBLS’s original patents to date in the areas of neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, inflammatory diseases, neuropathic pain and chronic pain. 
 ·
Michigan State University: Evaluation of the Company’s Neuroprotective and Anti-inflammatory Panel of Compounds for Immunomodulatory Activity Employing Human Primary Leukocytes. 
 ·
The University of Seville: Development of polymeric nanoparticles of cannabis-based terpene-mixtures for oral administration in pain treatments. 
 ·
The University of Cadiz: Testing the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned polymeric nanoparticles in a rodent model. 
 ·
University of Hawaii: Validating the efficacy of a complex cannabis-based mixture for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac disease in a rodent model. 
 
The Company also has consulting agreements with the following subject matter experts:

3

·
Dr. Zoltan Mari, Section Head, Nevada Movement Disorders Program & Lee Pascal Parkinson's Disease Scholar at Cleveland Clinic. 
 ·
Dr. Ziva Cooper, Columbia University, Associate Professor of Clinical Neurobiology, will design GBLS’s human neuropathic and chronic pain trials and provide strategic guidance on clinical development of these products. For nearly a decade, Dr. Cooper has been building on her training in preclinical models of drug dependence and developing an expertise in human laboratory studies on cannabis, cannabinoids, opioids, and cocaine while maintaining research projects in animal models of substance use. Her current research investigates the direct neurobiological effects of emerging drugs of abuse, including synthetic cannabinoids in laboratory animals and the direct physiological and behavioral effects of cannabinoids as they pertain to both their abuse potential and potential therapeutic effects in double-blind, placebo controlled human laboratory studies. Dr. Cooper’s research is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.Path to Market: Drug Development Stages and Proposed Clinical Trials
 
The Company has cannabis-based therapeutic products in the following stages of drug development: Discovery, Pre-Clinical, and entering the Clinical Phase. It has also licensed therapeutic products that the Company intends to develop through partners, labeled Partner Programs.
 
The completion of pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, and obtaining FDA-approvals for pharmaceutical products is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, GB Sciences believe that its drug development program, novel regulatory strategy, experienced development partners, and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. The Company uses a combination of in silico discovery methods and automated screening of cellular models of disease to decrease the time in Discovery prior to filing novel patent applications for disease-specific therapeutics. GB Sciences' original patent applications cover new chemical entities (“NCE”) based on complex combinations of plant-derived compounds. Its Exploratory IND/Phase 0 Program gets the Company to First-in-Man sooner than traditional programs, which reduces translational risks, and includes preliminary efficacy measures for responsible development decisions. In contrast, a traditional phased-development path would not provide any efficacy measures until Phase II. After the completion of our Phase 0 study, which compares the efficacies of multiple related cannabis-based formulations, the Company plans to advance the lead drug candidate using an adaptive trial design that is more efficient than the traditional phased-development pathway. GB Sciences has entered into research contracts, partnerships, and/or joint ventures with several respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools, universities, and other scientific researchers to increase developmental efficiencies. If and when one or more of the Company’s drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the FDA, the Company will seek to market them under licensing arrangements with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
 
The Company plans to use a combination of FDA-registered human clinical trials, as described in detail above, and pilot human studies in the development of its therapeutic product portfolio. Early in product development, human pilot studies that are fully-compliant with state medical cannabis programs will be used to gather early data on safety and efficacy that can later be referenced in the next phase of product development. The Company may be able to produce and sell the early products that prove efficacious, through licensing agreements with cannabis companies in other US states and countries that have legalized cannabis programs. GB Sciences believes that these pilot studies will provide significant value by reducing the cost of commercialization, more rapidly putting effective drugs in the hands of patients and accelerating by years the monetization of research. The Company’s goal is to be the perfect partner to those companies with greater resources and experience in the marketing and distribution of medications worldwide.
 
There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the FDA. Even if we obtain FDA approval for a therapy, there can be no assurance that it could be successfully marketed or would not be superseded by another cannabis-based therapy produced by one or more of our competitors. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of our Science Division. There can be no assurance that we will be 

4

able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If our Science Division fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more cannabis-based pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.
 
Agreement with Growblox Sciences Puerto Rico
 
On May 7, 2015, the Company entered into certain agreements with Growblox Sciences, Puerto Rico, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (“GBSPR”). GBSPR was formed and is being capitalized primarily by Cesar Cordero-Kruger, a prominent business executive and resident of Puerto Rico.
 
Under the terms of a commercialization agreement between the Company and GBSPR, the Company has granted to GBSPR the exclusive world-wide rights to all of our technology and intellectual property to:
 
(a)

manufacture, produce, lease and license our indoor series of controlled-climate indoor agricultural technology growing and cultivation chambers engineered and designed to produce medical grade cannabis and other plant extracts (the “Growblox Chambers”) and provide remote diagnostic monitoring and servicing of the Growing Chambers to third party growers and processors of hemp, cannabis and other plant extracts; 
 (b)

sell to the Company, for resale and distribution throughout the world, in all territories and jurisdictions (including states in the United States) where the sale and use of such products are permitted, any and all pharmaceutical raw materials and products as well as neutraceuticals and cosmeceutical skin care products derived from medical-grade cannabis and hemp raw materials that were cultivated and grown in Growblox Chambers; 
 (c)

use the trademarks and packaging developed by the Company to be used to identify all cannabis products grown in Growblox Chambers; 
 (d)

provide technical support for the licensing, permitting and other requisite applications for the cannabis business in Puerto Rico and related markets; 
 (e)

access all research supporting the Growblox Chambers and educational materials previously developed or collected in the future by the Company to the extent associated or used with GBSPR Business; and 
 (f)

access all of the dispensary related technology, proprietary information and contacts including, without limitation, technology, proprietary information, and contacts. 
 
All rights not granted to GBSPR under the commercialization agreement are retained by the Company and include the (i) right to conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials and ongoing research and development to create cannabis-based therapies for specific clinical conditions based on an understanding of how cannabinoids interact with the natural receptors in the human body; (ii) formulation of targeted combinations of active ingredients to combat specific conditions and diseases; (iii) use of proprietary cannabinoid formulations, to develop palliative and curative pharmaceutical treatment options and products for patients with certain critical diseases; (iv) exclusive right to sell, dispense and market cannabinoid and hemp based pharmaceutical raw materials and products as well as neutraceuticals and cosmeceutical skin care products throughout the world, either directly, through distributors or under other agreements with third parties; and (iv) right, directly, or through one or more of our subsidiaries (other than GBSPR), to cultivate, grow, dispense and sell medical-grade cannabis or marijuana in Nevada and Colorado.
 To the extent that GBSPR produces and sells to the Company for resale or distribution pharmaceutical raw materials and products, neutraceuticals and/or cosmeceutical skin care products derived from plants cultivated and grown in Growblox Chambers (collectively, the “Finished Products”), the Company has agreed to establish mutually acceptable transfer pricing between GBSPR and the Company for such Finished Products; failing which agreement, an independent third party will arbitrate such pricing and pricing policies. In the event that GBSPR is unable to fulfill 100% of the requirements of the customers for Growblox Chambers or Finished Products, GBSPR will subcontract such production to third parties that are reasonably acceptable to the Company. Neither the Company nor GBSPR may commercially sell (as opposed to leasing or licensing) Growblox Chambers without the consent of both parties.

The grant of rights under the commercialization agreement was subject to the condition that GBSPR obtain not less than $1.25 million of equity financing by no later than September 30, 2015, failing which we could unilaterally terminate the agreement. GBSPR failed to obtain the funds by September 30, 2015 required pursuant to the commercialization agreement. 
 
During the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company agreed to transfer approximately 17% of its membership interest in GB Sciences Puerto Rico, LLC (GBSPR) to Cesar Cordero-Kruger, who at the time of the agreement owned approximately 34% of GBSPR. The Company did not receive any consideration in the transaction but was relieved of any obligation to fund the losses of GBSPR going forward.
 
As the result of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of GBSPR since its ownership interest was reduced to a non-controlling level.
 
Total net liabilities deconsolidated were $228,572, which consisted of the following:
 

 | October 1, 2017 
Cash and cash equivalents | $ 19,417 
Long term deposits | 112,134 
Property and equipment | 45,752 
Less: | 
Accrued liabilities | 405,000 
Other liabilities | 875 
Net liabilities deconsolidated | $ (228,572) 

 
GBSPR has a history of recorded losses and no revenue or sales contracts to date. Its liabilities exceed its assets and management does not have any reason to believe that GBSPR will ever generate positive cash flows to the Company. The Company is not obligated to fund GBSPR’s future losses. Based on these facts, the Company determined that the fair value of its remaining interest in GBSPR is zero and recorded a gain on the deconsolidation of GBSPR, calculated as follows:
 

 | October 1, 2017 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------
Consideration received | $ - 
Fair value of retained noncontrolling interest | - 
Carrying value of noncontrolling interest | 129,396 
Net liabilities deconsolidated | 228,572 
Gain on sale of membership interest in GB Sciences Puerto Rico, LLC | $ 357,968 

 
The gain on deconsolidation of GBSPRLLC is classified under the other income/(expense) caption in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018. 
 
The investment in GBSPR will be accounted for under the equity method as the Company maintains significant influence but lacks control over GBSPR. Because the Company is not obligated to and does not intend to fund future losses, the Company’s share of GBSPR’s net losses will be suspended until GBSPR achieves cumulative net profitability.
 
Description of Operations
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary GB Sciences Nevada, LLC (“GBSN”) leases a warehouse facility at 3550 W. Teco Avenue, Las Vegas Nevada. On January 4, 2017, GBSN received a State Registration Certificate (“Certificate”) for its 28,000-sq. ft. cannabis cultivation facility located in Las Vegas, NV. The receipt of the Certificate allows the Company to cultivate medical cannabis. Phase 1 of the GBSN cultivation facility opened with 200 grow lights. 

6

When all phases of construction are completed, the facility is expected to generate revenues of $10 million. Completion of all Phases of this facility is dependent upon the availability of capital to complete construction. The Company has made completion of all Phases of this facility its number one priority.
 
On October 4, 2016, we acquired a 60% interest in a Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License with an option of up to 80%. A production license enables us to convert cannabis plants into to oils and extracts that are suitable for creating medical compounds as well as consumer products. This license is critical and essential to our plan of producing cannabis-based medicines and must be integrated into our cultivation facility to ensure quality control standards and efficiency in our production of cannabis medicines. On October 23, 2017, the Company amended the existing Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement (“Amended Production License Agreement”). Per the terms of the Amended Production License Agreement, GB Sciences purchased the remaining percentage of the production license resulting in the 100% ownership of the license. GB Sciences also received 100% ownership of the cultivation license included in the original Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement. In exchange, GB Sciences made one-time payment of $500,000 and issued a Promissory Note in the amount of $700,000 payable in equal monthly payments over a three-year period commencing on January 1, 2018. 
 
On March 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Arizona-based company, Kush Cups, to produce cannabis-infused products in the state of Nevada. Cannabis for production will be grown in our Cultivation Labs facility in Las Vegas, NV. We will distribute cannabis-infused Keurig-compatible K-Cups, hot and cold brew coffees as well as infused teas.
 
We expect our products to compete well in the marketplace because of the considerable efforts we have made in the plant genetics and tissue culturing of our proprietary strains of cannabis. And, we are the exclusive Nevada grower of Kyle Kushman's proprietary marijuana strains which have been highly rated top sellers in California. 
 
On November 1, 2017, the Company entered into an Edibles Production Agreement (the “EPA”) with The Happy Confections, L.L.C. (“THCLLC”) through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC (“GBSLV”). Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, a member of GB Science’s Board of Directors, is a Co-Managing Member of THCLLC. Under the EPA, THCLLC is to produce cannabis-infused baked goods and other edibles in GBSLV’s production facility upon approval of GBSLV’s Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License. The Company will receive a royalty of between 20% and 25% on all sales of edibles produced by THCLLC.
 
Contemporaneously with the EPA, the Company entered into a Non-Revolving Credit Line Agreement and Non-Revolving Credit Line Promissory Note (together, the “THC Note” or “Note”) to advance up to $300,000 to THCLLC for the purpose of expanding THCLLC’s operations. The Note bears interest at a rate of 1.29% per annum. Beginning 90 days after the sale of its first product, THCLLC is to make repayment of its advances under the Note in an amount equal to 25% of its gross sales revenue. Such repayment is due within 10 days of the sale of any product.
 
Under the EPA, the Company is to provide accounting and bookkeeping services to THCLLC. In connection with the EPA and THC note, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement for facility expenses and accounting services. Under the Reimbursement Agreement, the Company will be reimbursed $4,500 per month for facility expenses and $2,000 per month for accounting and bookkeeping services. In light of the fact that The Company will be providing the accounting and bookkeeping services to THCLLC, the Company may deduct royalties, facility expenses, and accounting expenses directly from the accounts of THCLLC.
 
On January 31, 2018 the Company entered into a Contract Farming Agreement with Colorado Hemp Project Limited (“CHP”) for the development and cultivation of boutique help genetics and new strains of hemp which will provide the key ingredient in proprietary CBD formulations. Per the terms of the agreement, the Company leased 8 acres of land on which CHP planted 2000 seeds per acre. CHP is responsible for providing genetics, land, water, planting, cultivation, any soil amendments needed, harvest, drying and stripping into whole plant composite for extraction, if desired. In return, GB Sciences is obligated to pay for all production expenses and delivery or shipping for the total of $16,750 per acre of land farmed. On March 15, 2018, the Company leased additional 5 acres of land from CHP under the same terms as those included in the original agreement.

Competition
 
The medical cannabis industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include TerraTech Corp., Cannabis Science, Inc., Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cannabis-Rx, Inc. and Nemus Biosciences, Inc. In addition, the development of therapies and pharmaceutical products based on extracts from the cannabis plant is being undertaken by a number of medical and educational institutions, including the University of Mississippi, which is the only U.S. based entity authorized by the Federal government to cultivate cannabis for research. Such institutions have significantly greater financial resources and facilities than we have
Government Regulation and Federal Policy
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis (marijuana) is a stage 1 narcotic that is addictive and has no medical benefit. Accordingly, and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited and subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical cannabis, there is a risk that the federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be engaged in producing, cultivating, or dispensing cannabis in violation of federal law, or we may be deemed to be facilitating the sale or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law with respect to our Company’s business operations. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our strategic goals, revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. See “Risk Factors” below. 
 The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by San Diego County, California that sought to establish federal preemption over state medical cannabis laws. The preemption claim was rejected by every court that reviewed the case. The California 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in its unanimous ruling, “Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws.” However, in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, as long as the CSA contains prohibitions against cannabis, under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the United States may criminalize the production and use of cannabis even where states approve its use for medical purposes.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Cannabis Enforcement to all United States attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.
 
The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational cannabis possession in small amounts.
 
The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 
•

Distribution of cannabis to children; 
 •

Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminals; 
 •

Diversion of medical cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not; 
 •

Using state authorized cannabis activity as a pretext of another illegal drug activity; 
 •

Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
 •

Preventing drugged driving; 
 •

Growing cannabis on federal property; and 
 •

Preventing possession or use of cannabis on federal property. 
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Ogden Memo and the Cole Memos.

8

The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of cannabis for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address cannabis activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical cannabis and recreational cannabis in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis. 
 
In contrast to federal policy, there are currently 29 states and the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, we employed sixty employees consisting of management and support staff.
