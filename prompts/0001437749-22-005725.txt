ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Tidewater Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “TDW”, provides offshore marine support and transportation services to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels. We were incorporated in 1956 and conduct our operations through wholly-owned United States (U.S.) and international subsidiaries, as well as through joint ventures in which Tidewater has either majority or non-controlling interests (generally where required to satisfy local ownership or local content requirements). Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “the company” as used herein refer to Tidewater Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors.
 
On July 31, 2017, Tidewater successfully emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and adopted fresh-start accounting. 
 
About Tidewater 
 
Our vessels and associated vessel services provide support primarily for all phases of offshore oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production as well as windfarm development and maintenance. These services include towing of, and anchor handling for, mobile offshore drilling units; transporting supplies and personnel necessary to sustain drilling, workover and production activities; offshore construction and seismic and subsea support; geotechnical survey support for windfarm construction, and a variety of specialized services such as pipe and cable laying. In addition, we have one of the broadest geographic operating footprints in the offshore vessel industry.
 
Our principal customers are large, international integrated and independent oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production companies (IOCs); select mid-sized and smaller independent exploration and production (E&P) companies; foreign government-owned or government-controlled organizations and other related companies that explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas (NOCs); drilling contractors; and other companies that provide various services to the offshore energy industry, including but not limited to, offshore construction companies, windfarm development companies, diving companies and well stimulation companies.
 
Our active offshore support vessel fleet consists primarily of company owned vessels. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 135 active vessels of which nine have been temporarily stacked or withdrawn from service. In addition, we owned 18 vessels that have been designated for sale and have been classified as such on the Balance Sheet. Please refer to Notes (1) and (7) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our stacked vessels and vessels held for sale.
 
Our revenues, net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of our offshore support vessel fleet. Our business activity is largely dependent on offshore exploration, field development and production activity by our customers. Our customers’ business activity, in turn, is dependent on actual and expected crude oil and natural gas prices, which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas, and on estimates of the cost (and relative cost) of finding, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas reserves.
 
Depending on vessel capabilities and availability, our vessels operate in the shallow, intermediate and deepwater offshore markets. Deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi-year development plans. Although these projects are generally less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas, deepwater exploration and development projects are generally more costly than other onshore and offshore exploration and development. As a result, the low levels of crude oil prices over the past few years have caused many IOCs, E&P companies and NOCs to restrain their level of capital expenditures in regard to deepwater projects. Recent recoveries in crude oil and natural gas prices have not yet resulted in a return to pre-pandemic (see discussion below) levels of activity. Even so, we expect an increase in activity in the year 2022 over the year 2021 levels as our customers seek to restore their production capacity. Offshore windfarm developments are forecasted to increase over the coming years, and these may provide additional opportunities for a certain cross-section of our larger vessels. These projects generally require fewer and more specialized vessels.
 
Revenues are derived primarily from vessel time charter or similar contracts that are generally from three months to several years in duration, and, to a lesser extent, from vessel time charter contracts on a “spot” basis, which is a short-term agreement ranging from one day to three months to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short-term job. The base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate, though some charter arrangements allow us to recover specific additional costs.

COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic) and, in response, much of the industrialized world had initiated severe measures to lessen its impact. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption throughout 2020 and 2021. With respect to our sector, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a much lower demand for oil as national, regional, and local governments imposed travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders, and limitations on business operations in order to contain its spread. During this same period, oil-producing countries struggled to reach consensus on worldwide production levels, resulting in both a market oversupply of oil and a precipitous fall in crude oil prices.
 
Combined, these conditions adversely affected our operations and business beginning in late March 2020 and continuing through the remainder of 2020 and 2021. Our industry began to experience signs of recovery in the fourth quarter of 2021 and into the current year. The initial reduction in demand for hydrocarbons together with a decline in the price of crude oil at the outset of the pandemic, resulted in our primary customers, the oil and gas companies, making material reductions to their planned spending on offshore projects, compounding the effect of COVID-19 on offshore operations. Worldwide demand for crude oil has increased steadily since the second quarter of 2020 and is now near pre-pandemic levels. See further discussion of the impact of COVID-19, including the resulting crude oil demand and price impact, on our operations in 2021 and our responses to the challenges of these events in "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Offices and Facilities 
 
Our worldwide headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 842 West Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77024, and our telephone number is (713) 470-5300. Our U.S. marine operations are based in Amelia, Louisiana and Houston, Texas. We conduct our international operations through facilities and offices located in over 30 countries. Our principal international offices and/or warehouse facilities, most of which are leased, are in Brazil; Mexico; Trinidad; Scotland; Egypt; Angola; Nigeria; Cameroon; Singapore; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Norway. Our operations generally do not require highly specialized facilities, and suitable facilities are generally available on a leased basis as required.
Reporting Segments and Vessel Classifications 
 
Our reporting segments are based on geographic markets: the Americas segment, which includes the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Trinidad, Mexico and Brazil; the Middle East/Asia Pacific segment, which includes Saudi Arabia, East Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia; the Europe/Mediterranean segment, which includes the United Kingdom, Norway and Egypt; and the West Africa segment, which includes Angola, Nigeria, and other coastal regions of West Africa. Our vessels routinely move from one geographic region and reporting segment to another, and from one operating area to another operating area within the geographic regions and reporting segments. Discussed below are our three major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each vessel class and the services the respective vessels typically perform.
Deepwater Vessels 
 
Deepwater vessels, in the aggregate, are usually our largest contributor to consolidated vessel revenue and vessel operating margin. Included in this vessel class are large platform supply vessels (PSVs) (typically longer than 230-feet and/or with greater than 2,800 tons in dead weight cargo carrying capacity) and large, higher-horsepower anchor handling tug supply vessels (AHTS vessels) (generally greater than 10,000 brake horsepower or BHP). These vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs and production platforms and for otherwise supporting intermediate and deepwater drilling, production, construction and maintenance operations. Deepwater PSVs generally have large cargo carrying capacities, both below deck (liquid mud tanks and dry bulk tanks) and above deck. Deepwater AHTS vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment, as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs that generally do not have dynamic positioning capabilities. Many of our deepwater PSVs and AHTS vessels are outfitted with dynamic positioning capabilities, which allow the vessels to maintain an absolute or relative position when mooring to an offshore installation, rig or another vessel is deemed unsafe, impractical or undesirable. Many of our deepwater PSVs and AHTS vessels also have oil recovery, firefighting, standby rescue and/or other specialized equipment. Our customers have high standards regarding safety and other operational competencies and capabilities, in part to meet the regulatory standards that continue to be more stringent.
 
    6 

  

Our deepwater class of vessels also includes specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation, construction work, subsea services and/or serve as remote accommodation facilities. These vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services, but are also outfitted, and primarily intended, for specialty services. For example, these vessels can be equipped with a variety of lifting and deployment systems, including large capacity cranes, winches or reel systems.
 
Towing-Supply Vessels 
 
Included in this class are non-deepwater AHTS vessels with horsepower less than 10,000 BHP, and non-deepwater PSVs that are generally less than 230 feet in length. The vessels in this class perform the same respective functions and services as deepwater AHTS vessels and deepwater PSVs except towing-supply vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters.
 
Other Vessels 
 
Included in this class are crew boats, utility vessels and offshore tugs. Crew boats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations. These vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy, kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern. Offshore tugs are used to tow floating drilling rigs and barges; to assist in the docking of tankers; and to assist pipe laying, cable laying and construction barges.
Customers and Contracting 
 
Our operations are dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production throughout the world, which are affected by trends in global crude oil and natural gas pricing, including expectations of future commodity pricing, which are ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources. The activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost (and relative cost) of exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas offshore, which can be affected by environmental regulations, technological advances that affect energy production and consumption, significant weather conditions, the ability of our customers to raise capital, and local and international economic and political environments, including government mandated moratoriums.
 
Our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts on our vessels on a rate per day of service basis; therefore, vessel revenues are recognized daily throughout the contract period.
 
The following table discloses our customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenues:
 

 | Years Ended | 
--------------------+--------------+-----
 | December 31, | | | December 31, | | December 31,
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019 
Chevron Corporation | | 15.7 | % | | 14.3 | % | 13.0 | %
Saudi Aramco | | 11.8 | % | | 11.5 | % | * | 

 
* Less than 10% of total revenues.
 
While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our vessel time charter contracts turn over, the unexpected loss of any of our significant customers could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect on our vessel utilization and our results of operations. Our five and ten largest customers accounted for approximately 45.9% and 60.2% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
 
Competition 
 
We have numerous mid-size and large competitors. The principal competitive factors for the offshore support vessel service industry are the quality, suitability and technical capabilities of vessels, availability of vessels and related equipment, price and quality of service. In addition, the ability to demonstrate a strong record for safety and efficiency and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors. We have numerous competitors in all areas in which we operate around the world, and the business environment in each of these markets is highly competitive. Competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, local construction, flagging, ownership or control of vessels, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens and/or the purchase of supplies from local vendors.
 
    7 

  

Our diverse, mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of our assets generally enable us to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to customers around the world. We believe that the size, age, diversity and geographic distribution of a vessel operator’s fleet, economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world are competitive advantages in our industry. In the Americas region, we benefit from cabotage which includes rules and restrictions promulgated thereunder by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (collectively, the Jones Act), which limit vessels that can operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to those owned by companies that qualify as U.S. citizens. Also, in certain foreign countries, preferences given to vessels owned by local companies may be mandated by local law or by national oil companies. We have attempted to mitigate some of the impact of such preferences through affiliations with local companies.
 
Increases in worldwide vessel capacity generally have the effect of lowering charter rates, particularly when there are lower levels of exploration, field development and production activity in the crude oil and natural gas industry, as was the case in late calendar 2014 when oil prices began to trend lower. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic created additional oversupply as customers have cancelled or delayed projects as discussed above.
 
Angolan Joint Venture (Sonatide)
 
We previously disclosed the significant financial and operational challenges that we confront with respect to operations in Angola, as well as steps that we have taken to address or mitigate those risks. The amounts due from Sonatide are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, the underlying third-party customer payments to Sonatide were satisfied, in part, in Angolan kwanzas. We and Sonangol, our partner in Sonatide, have had discussions regarding how the net losses from the devaluation of certain Angolan kwanza denominated accounts should be shared. In late 2019, we were informed that, as part of a broad privatization program, Sonangol intended to seek to divest itself from Sonatide. In January 2022, we acquired the 51% interest of Sonatide previously held by our partner, which has resulted in Sonatide becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. Please refer to Note (15) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this acquisition.
 
In the second quarter of 2020, Sonatide declared a $35.0 million dividend. On June 22, 2020, Sonangol received $17.8 million and we received $17.2 million. Our share of the dividend is reflected as dividend income from unconsolidated company in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, as a result of this dividend payment, the cash balances of the joint venture were significantly reduced and we determined that, as a result, a significant portion of our net due from Sonatide balance was compromised. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a $0.4 and $40.9 million affiliate credit loss impairment expense, respectively.
 
Refer to Notes (4) and (15) of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on Sonatide.
 
Nigerian Joint Venture (DTDW)
 
We own 40% of DTDW in Nigeria. Our partner, who owns 60%, is a Nigerian national. DTDW owns one offshore support vessel. We also operate company owned vessels in Nigeria for which the joint venture receives a commission. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had no company owned vessels operating in Nigeria and the DTDW owned vessel was not employed.
 
Cash flow projections indicate that DTDW does not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations to us or its vendors. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded affiliate credit loss impairment expense totaling $12.1 million and additional impairment expense of $2.0 million for the guarantee of our expected share of DTDW's long-term debt. Our operations in Nigeria have been severely impacted and we have effectively ceased activity. We have created a fully reserved position in our consolidated balance sheet to account for our expected liabilities related to certain obligations of the joint venture.
 
As of December 31, 2020, DTDW had long-term debt of $4.7 million which was secured by the vessel owned by DTDW and guarantees from the DTDW partners (in proportion to their ownership interests). On April 22, 2021, we paid approximately $2.0 million, which represented our portion of the joint venture debt guarantee which was expensed in 2020 and our partner assumed the remaining joint venture debt which represented his portion of the guarantee.
 
Refer to Note (4) of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the Nigerian joint venture.

International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention
 
The International Labour Organization's Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the MLC) mandates globally, among other things, seafarer living and working conditions (accommodations, wages, conditions of employment, health and other benefits) aboard ships that are engaged in commercial activities. Since its initial entry into force on August 20, 2013, 90 countries have now ratified the MLC.
 
We maintain certification of our vessels to MLC requirements, perform maintenance and repairs at shipyards, and make port calls during ocean voyages in accordance with the MLC based on the dates of enforcement by countries in which we operate. In addition, where possible, we continue to work with identified flag states to seek substantial equivalencies to comparable national and industry laws that meet the intent of the MLC and allow us to standardize operational protocols among our fleet.
 
Government Regulation 
 
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of our vessels. Our U.S. flagged vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Maritime Administration. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where we operate.
 
Under the citizenship provisions of the Jones Act, we would not be permitted to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade if more than 25% of our outstanding stock are owned by non-U.S. Citizens (as defined by the Jones Act). For a company engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade to be deemed a U.S. citizen: (i) it must be organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof, (ii) each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a U.S. citizen, (iii) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. Citizens and (iv) at least 75% of the interest in such corporation must be owned by U.S. citizens. We have a dual stock certificate system to protect against non-U.S. Citizens owning more than 25% of our common stock. In addition, our charter provides us with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of our common stock that would result in the ownership by non-U.S. Citizens of more than 24% of our common stock. Based on the latest information available to us, less than 24% of our outstanding common stock was owned by non-U.S. Citizens as of December 31, 2021.
 
Our vessel operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are considered to be coastwise trade. U.S. law requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade must be built in the U.S. and registered under U.S. flag. In addition, once a U.S. built vessel is registered under a non-U.S. flag, it cannot thereafter engage in U.S. coastwise trade. Therefore, our non-U.S. flagged vessels must operate outside of the U.S. coastwise trade zone. Of the total 135 active vessels that we owned or operated at December 31, 2021, 125 vessels were registered under flags other than the United States and 10 vessels were registered under the U.S. flag.
 
All our offshore vessels are subject to either United States or international safety and classification standards or sometimes both. Deepwater PSVs, deepwater AHTS vessels, towing-supply vessels, and crew boats are required to undergo periodic inspections generally twice within every five year period pursuant to U.S. Coast Guard regulations. Vessels registered under flags other than the United States are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies, such as the American Bureau of Shipping.
 
We comply with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988), and further mandated in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of the ISPS Code and SOLAS. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses, and develop vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those U.S. flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the U.S. Coast Guard pursuant to the latest revision of Maritime Security Directive 104-6.
 
Occupational Safety and Health Compliance 
 
In the U.S., we are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and other similar laws and regulations, which establish workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures.
 
    9 

  

As described above, certain of the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.K., have ratified the MLC, which establishes minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers, including conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection. Although the U.S. is not a party to the MLC, U.S. flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when calling on a port in a country that is a party to the MLC.
 
Environmental Compliance 
 
During the ordinary course of business, our operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions and other sanctions. Compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had, nor is expected to have, a material effect on us. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, however, and may impose increasingly strict requirements, and, as such, we cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations. In addition, a wide range of governmental regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and certain individual states, regulate vessels and other structures in accordance with the requirements of federal and state law. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies, which increases our compliance costs and risk of non-compliance. Existing U.S. environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to:

● | the Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various preconstruction, operational, monitoring and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as the authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the U.S.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which govern oil and natural gas operations on federal lands and waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and potential liabilities for pollution damages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the U.S. and abroad, we are subject to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), an international convention that imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling of certain substances, sewage and air emissions. Annex VI of MARPOL addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide, and requires the use of low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. The International Maritime Organization designates the waters off North America as an Emission Control Area, meaning that vessels operating in the U.S. must use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Directives have been issued designed to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. These can impact both the fuel and the engines that may be used onboard vessels. For further discussion of regulatory risks related to climate change see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We are also involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters. The amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard our vessels and at shore-based locations. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 also requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the USCG with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from those vessels. Several foreign jurisdictions also require us to present satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility. We satisfy these requirements through appropriate insurance coverage, as discussed below in “Risk Management.”
 
    10 

  

Moreover, environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of our vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Whenever possible, hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas to ensure containment, if accidents were to occur. In addition, we have established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment, including being committed to responsible ship recycling in accordance with the Hong Kong convention and European Ship Recycling Regulation.
 
In addition to governmental regulation, large oil and gas producers have developed strict due diligence processes for selecting their suppliers out of concerns for the environmental impact of their operations. Our failure to maintain any of our vessels to the standards required by the industry could put us in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement. Should we not be able to successfully clear such risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, the future employment of our vessels could also be adversely affected since it might lead to the termination of existing charters.
 
Safety 
 
We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our operations for our employees, our customers and any personnel associated with our operations. Tidewater’s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents many safety challenges. Management communicates frequently with company personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits using company media directed at, and regular training of, both our seamen and shore-based personnel. We dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance. Our Director of Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) Management is involved in numerous proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries from occurring. The HSES Director also reviews all incidents that occur, focusing on lessons that can be learned from such incidents and opportunities to incorporate such lessons into our on-going safety-related training. In addition, we employ safety personnel to be responsible for administering our safety programs and fostering our safety culture. Our position is that each of our employees is a safety supervisor with the authority and the obligation to stop any operation that they deem to be unsafe.
Risk Management 
 
The operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of marine losses (including physical damage to the vessel) attributable to adverse sea and weather conditions, mechanical failure, and collisions. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities, hostile activities attributable to war, sabotage, piracy and terrorism, as well as business interruption due to political action or inaction, including nationalization of assets by foreign governments. Any such event may lead to a reduction in revenues or increased costs. Our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss, including war, acts of terrorism, and pollution risks, but we do not directly or fully insure for business interruption. We also carry workers’ compensation, maritime employer’s liability, director and officer liability, general liability (including third party pollution) and other insurance customary in the industry.
 
The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political, economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of U.S. headquartered companies such as ours. The resulting economic, political and social uncertainties, including the potential for future terrorist acts and war, could cause the premiums charged for the insurance coverage to increase. We currently maintain war risk coverage on our entire fleet.
 
We seek to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates, in part, by maintaining self-insurance up to certain individual and aggregate loss limits. We carefully monitor claims and actively participate in claims estimates and adjustments. Estimated costs of self-insured claims, which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims, are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet.
 
We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate. We have not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits; however, there is no assurance that our liability coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. While we believe that we should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially acceptable rates given the markets in which we operate. For further discussion of our risks see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental, Social and Governance Factors
 
We are committed to transparently reporting on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that may be relevant to us. Our board of directors engages in regular discussions relating to environmental matters and our response to ESG-related risks and opportunities. There has been an increasing amount of ESG disclosure by publicly listed companies in recent years and we expect this trend to continue. Increasing ESG disclosure may be driven by investor expectations, SEC requirements, regulation or in response to stakeholder concerns. We use internationally-recognized methods and reporting standards to measure and disclose our performance in relation to ESG factors. In 2021, we issued our inaugural formal sustainability report, reviewing our ESG performance, actions and initiatives for the 2020 calendar year. This report was developed in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting standards, in addition to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Marine Transportation standard. A climate risk review was also performed in accordance with the recommendations provided by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the results of this review were included in the Sustainability Report. For further discussion of ESG risks and considerations see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Energy Transition
 
Climate change concerns have precipitated a call from governments and other entities to transition from fossil fuels for energy production and power transportation. The primary offender in climate change is considered to be carbon emissions. The recent goal of the advocates of the energy transition is to reduce world-wide carbon emissions to net zero by the year 2050. The preferred energy sources that produce no carbon emissions are wind, solar and nuclear. Our Sustainability Report addresses our progress toward attaining lower carbon emissions and supporting more environmentally friendly energy sources. We believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively navigate the energy transition and we believe we will have opportunities to participate in that transition while also supporting the fossil fuel industry. We currently have a few vessels supporting the wind farm business. We also expect to have significant opportunities from the offshore E&P industry as they dismantle their massive offshore production infrastructure during the transition. We believe that the fossil fuel industry will continue to provide fuel for energy throughout the transition and we are prepared to provide support through the process.
Seasonality 
 
Our global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration, field development and construction work in the oil and gas industry. Hurricanes, cyclones, the monsoon season, and other severe weather can negatively or positively impact vessel operations. Our GOM operations can be impacted by the Atlantic hurricane season from the months of June through November, when offshore exploration, field development and construction work tend to slow or halt to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the area. However, demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the GOM in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore crude oil and natural gas infrastructure. Our vessels that operate offshore in India, other areas in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific are impacted by the monsoon season, which occurs across the region from November to April. Vessels that operate in the North Sea can be impacted by a seasonal slowdown in the winter months, generally from November to March. Although hurricanes, cyclones, monsoons and other severe weather can have a seasonal impact on operations, our business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas pricing, global supply of crude oil and natural gas, and demand for our offshore support vessels and other services than on any seasonal variation.
Human Capital Management
 
Employees and Labor Relations
 
 As of December 31, 2021, we employ approximately 4,400 employees worldwide. Our global footprint has over 90% of our fleet working internationally in more than 30 countries. We are not a party to any union contract in the United States but through several subsidiaries, we are subject to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the United States, most heavily in the North Sea with UK and Norwegian mariners.

Culture and Engagement
 
Company culture is a key focus for the Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) and the rest of the senior leadership. Tidewater’s culture is promoted through its “7 Cs”:

● | Capability
--+-----------


● | Collaboration
--+--------------


● | Commitment
--+-----------


● | Communication

Our focus is on creating an environment where our colleagues feel respected, valued, and can contribute to their fullest potential. We leverage technology to promote online collaborative workspaces to bring our colleagues together across multiple time zones and geographies and create a global sense of community. In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management. A large majority of our onshore workforce has worked remotely beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and, for those who continue to work on site, we instituted safety protocols and procedures in line with guidance provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
 
Health and Safety
 
We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and any personnel associated with our operations. Our principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents many safety challenges. Management communicates frequently with company personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits using company media directed at, and regular training of, both our mariners and shore-based personnel. We dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance. In addition, we employ safety personnel who are responsible for administering our safety programs and fostering our safety culture and monitoring the results of our safety programs and initiatives. Our position is that each of our employees is a safety supervisor with the authority and the obligation to stop any operation that they deem to be unsafe.
 
By establishing practical safeguards against all identified risks, we take a consistent and proactive approach to minimizing the number of accidents, incidents and hazardous occurrences. We utilize both leading and lagging indicators to monitor the performance of our health and safety programs. Lagging indicators include the Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) and the Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) based upon the number of incidents per one million working hours. Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near miss events and Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) training activities. In calendar year 2021, we had a TRIR of 0.67, a LTIR of 0.07 and no work-related fatalities.
 
In 2021, we continued to experience significant challenges resulting from COVID-19. Revised safety protocols were immediately implemented and management in each area of operation ensured constant compliance with local government, customer and other restrictions and guidelines to help mitigate risk of exposure of our employees and contractors.
 
Inclusion and Diversity
 
We embrace the diversity of our team members, stakeholders and customers, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. We comply with all applicable employment, labor and immigration requirements, and require our personnel to cooperate with all compliance efforts. We have a policy of continuous improvement; opportunities to further connect and support collaboration between our diverse employee base continue to be identified and addressed with further investments in training, tools and systems.

We are committed to racial equality and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout our organization, a commitment that both starts with, and is reflected in, our board of directors. We have made diversity and inclusion an important part of our hiring and retention efforts. Our CHRO has primary responsibility for our human capital management strategy, including attracting, developing, engaging and retaining those talented employees. The CHRO is also responsible for the design of employee compensation and benefits programs in addition to promoting diversity and inclusion throughout the Company.
