Item 1. Business
Overview
Globus Medical, Inc. (“Globus,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a medical device company that develops and commercializes solutions for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. Today we are primarily focused on implants that promote healing in patients with spine disorders. In 2017, we launched ExcelsiusGPS™, a revolutionary robotic guidance and navigation system that supports minimally invasive and open orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures, with screw placement applications in spine and orthopedic surgery. We completed our first sale of ExcelsiusGPS™ in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, we initially launched our first products for the treatment of patients who have experienced orthopedic trauma.
5

We are an engineering-driven company with a history of rapidly developing and commercializing advanced products and procedures to assist surgeons in effectively treating their patients and address new treatment options.  Since our inception in 2003, we have launched over 180 products and offer a comprehensive portfolio of innovative and differentiated products addressing a broad array of musculoskeletal pathologies, anatomies and surgical approaches.
All of our current products fall into one of two categories: Innovative Fusion or Disruptive Technologies. Our Innovative Fusion products comprise fusion products designed to treat a wide variety of spinal disorders or trauma and can be used in a variety of surgical approaches. We believe our Innovative Fusion products have features and characteristics that provide advantages for surgeons and potentially contribute to better outcomes for patients as compared to competing traditional fusion products.
We define Disruptive Technologies as those that represent a significant shift in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders or trauma by allowing for novel surgical procedures, improvements to existing surgical procedures and/or the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders earlier in the continuum of care. We believe the use of Disruptive Technologies may improve patient outcomes and reduce costs given the expected lower morbidity rates, shorter patient recovery times and shorter hospital stays associated with these procedures. Additionally, Disruptive Technologies may help patients avoid progression of spinal disc disease sometimes caused by traditional surgical options such as spinal fusion. Our current portfolio of approved and pipeline Disruptive Technology products includes products that allow for minimally invasive surgical (“MIS”) techniques, as well as new treatment alternatives, including imaging, navigational and robotic (“INR”) technologies, motion preservation technologies, such as dynamic stabilization, total disc replacement and interspinous process spacer products; regenerative biologics technologies; and interventional pain management solutions, including treatments for vertebral compression fractures. ExcelsiusGPS™, our robotic guidance and navigation system, falls within the Disruptive Technologies category.
While we group our products into two categories, our products are not limited to a particular technology, platform or surgical approach. Instead, our goal is to offer surgeons a complete suite of products they can use to most effectively treat their patients, based on the patient’s specific anatomy and condition and the surgeon’s particular training and surgical preference.
To date, the primary market for our products has been the United States, where we sell our products through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and distributor sales representatives employed by our exclusive independent distributors, who distribute our products on our behalf for a commission that is generally based on a percentage of sales. We believe there is significant opportunity to strengthen our position in the U.S. market by increasing the size of our U.S. sales force and we intend to add additional direct and distributor sales representatives in the future.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, our international sales accounted for approximately 17% of our total sales. The international sales total includes a full year of results following the September 1, 2016 acquisition of the international operations and distribution channel of Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (“Alphatec International”). We have sold our products in 54 countries outside the United States through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and international distributors. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence in both existing and new international markets through the continued expansion of our direct and distributor sales forces and the commercialization of additional products.

Strategy
Our goal is to become the leader in providing innovative solutions to promote healing in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. To achieve this goal, we are employing the following business strategies:

• | Leverage our integrated product development engine. We plan to continue developing new spine products, as well as additional INR technologies and orthopedic trauma products, using our product development engine. We believe our team-oriented approach, active surgeon input and demonstrated product development capabilities position us to maintain a rapid rate of new product launches. We launched eleven new products in 2017, have over 30 potential new products in various stages of development, and expect to launch approximately five to ten new products in each of the next three years. 


• | Increase the size, scope and productivity of our exclusive U.S. sales force. We believe there is significant opportunity for us to further penetrate existing markets and to enter new markets by increasing the size and geographic scope of our exclusive U.S. sales force. We expect to continue to increase the number of our direct and distributor sales representatives in the United States to expand into new geographic territories and to deepen our penetration in existing territories. We will also continue to provide our sales representatives with specialized development programs designed to improve their productivity. In addition, we continue to build exclusive sales forces in the U.S. and internationally to support the launch of our INR technologies and orthopedic trauma products. 


• | Continue to expand into international markets. As of December 31, 2017, we had an existing direct or distributor sales presence in 54 countries outside the United States. We expect to continue to increase our international presence through the commercialization of additional products, including our INR technologies and orthopedic trauma products, and through the expansion of our international sales force. 


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances. In 2017, we acquired KB Medical SA (“KB Medical”), a Swiss-based robotics developer, to further bolster our INR development team, intellectual property, and product portfolio. We intend to selectively pursue acquisitions and alliances in the future that will provide us with new or complementary technologies, personnel with significant relevant experience, or increased market penetration. We are currently evaluating a number of possible acquisitions or strategic relationships and believe that our resources and experience make us an attractive acquirer or partner. 

The Spine Market
Spine disorders are a leading driver of healthcare costs worldwide. Spine disorders range in severity from mild pain and loss of feeling to extreme pain and paralysis. These disorders are primarily caused by degenerative conditions in the spine, deformity, tumors and trauma.
Treatment alternatives for spine disorders range from non-operative conservative therapies to surgical interventions. Conservative therapies include bed rest, medication and physical therapy. When conservative therapies fail to provide adequate quality of life improvements, surgical interventions may be used to address pain. Surgical treatments for spine disorders can be instrumented, which include the use of implants, or non-instrumented, which forego the use of any such implants.
7

We believe the spine market will continue to experience growth as a result of the following market influences:

• | Favorable patient demographics. The worldwide population is ageing and improvements in healthcare have led to increasing life expectancies worldwide and the opportunity to lead more active lifestyles at advanced ages. These trends are expected to generate increased demand for spine surgeries. 


• | Improving technologies leading to increased use in fusion procedures. Spinal fusion has become a standard treatment option for patients presenting more advanced stages of spine disease. We expect the number of fusion cases to grow as innovation in fusion products makes spine surgery a more attractive option for patients. 


• | Disruptive Technologies driving earlier interventions and creating an expanded patient base. Newer technology products and procedures have enabled novel surgical procedures, improvements to existing surgical procedures, the treatment of spine disorders by new physician specialties, and surgical intervention earlier in the continuum of care, all of which may result in better outcomes for patients. As a result, we expect Disruptive Technologies, including INR technologies, to increase the size of the addressable patient population for spine surgery. 


• | Continued growth of spine procedures worldwide. We believe that improvements to the standard of care outside of the United States will increase the international demand for spine products. 

The Globus Solution 
We currently offer over 180 products for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.
Innovative Fusion Products
Our Innovative Fusion products include a range of implant and surgical approach options to treat degenerative, deformity, tumor, and trauma conditions along the entire spine, from the occiput to the sacrum. We believe our products provide advantages over traditional fusion products that may help improve surgical techniques, and may contribute to better outcomes for patients. For example, QUARTEX®, our Occipito-Cervico-Thoracic (“OCT”) stabilization system, was designed to address a number of challenges associated with posterior OCT fusion to aid in easier construct assembly. QUARTEX® features a threading locking cap to enable quick and efficient low-torque single step locking and high angle screw heads that accommodate two different diameter rods. Our Innovative Fusion products also include the Alphatec products we began distributing following the Alphatec International transaction.
Disruptive Technologies Products
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this higher-growth segment of the spine market given our multiple existing commercialized products and several products in various stages of development. We have a broad, comprehensive product portfolio and pipeline of Disruptive Technologies, including our expandable cages, MIS, INR technology, motion preservation, and regenerative biologics technologies, as well as interventional pain management solutions.

Globus markets an innovative line of expandable interbody fusion devices designed to be inserted at a minimized height and then expanded during surgery to obtain optimal fit between vertebral bodies. This expandability feature allows for restoration of height following disc removal while easing insertion into the disc space to help reduce trauma to the vertebral endplates as well as the surrounding tissue. For example, ELSA®-ATP, which we launched in 2017, is an expandable lateral device with integrated fixation that can be implanted through an anterior-to-the-psoas approach. This first-of-its-kind device is inserted at an oblique angle, which reduces the need for transpsoas resection and may obviate the need for neuromonitoring. ELSA®-ATP allows for post expansion introduction of bone graft and includes integrated screws for enhanced fixation. 
Regenerative biologics products, including bioactive glass-based KINEX® and SIGNIFY™ bone void fillers and CONDUCT® ceramic-collagen, are well suited for pelvic/extremity and posterolateral spinal fusion procedures. 
ExcelsiusGPS™, a robotic guidance and navigation system, is our first INR technology product to come to market. ExcelsiusGPS™ was CE-marked in 2016 and FDA-cleared in 2017, and we made our first commercial sale in the fourth quarter of 2017. The ExcelsiusGPS™ technology supports both minimally invasive and open orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures, with applications ranging from the cervical spine to the sacroilium, long bones and occiput. ExcelsiusGPS™ integrates seamlessly with Globus implants and instruments and is compatible with pre-operative CT, intra-operative CT and fluoroscopic imaging modalities. The system is designed to minimize radiation exposure, streamline workflow, and reproducibly assist in implant placement.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we launched our first products for the treatment of orthopedic trauma. To date, we have received clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for 11 trauma systems, including our CAPTIVATE™ compression screws, ANTHEM™ fixation plates, AUTOBAHN™ intramedullary nails, and our ARBOR™ external fixation system.
Product Development and Research
Globus believes in bringing products to market quickly by reducing the time from product conception to launch. We believe our approach to product development is unique and highly efficient. We employ an integrated team approach to product development involving collaboration among surgeons, our engineers, our dedicated researchers, our highly-skilled machinists, and our regulatory personnel. We believe that this team approach, as well as our extensive in-house facilities, allows us to design, test and obtain regulatory clearance and approvals of our products more effectively. We also believe that our product development engine provides us with a competitive advantage in developing products that will solve challenges for surgeons and improve outcome for patients.
Our product development efforts are supported by our in-house research capabilities. We believe that centralizing and consolidating the critical elements of the product development and commercialization process in one facility allows us to bring products from the concept stage to the market more rapidly. Research resources available in-house include a mechanical testing laboratory, spinal kinematics laboratory, tribology laboratory, cadaveric laboratory, materials characterization laboratory, computational laboratory, and clinical and biomechanical research experts.
The markets in which we operate are subject to rapid technological advancements. We must constantly improve existing products and introduce new products in order to continue to succeed. Accordingly, we have made significant investments in our product development and research capabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent $43.7 million, $44.5 million and $36.3 million, respectively, including costs from our INR technology and orthopedic trauma products, on research and development.

Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products through our exclusive global sales force. As of December 31, 2017, we had a direct or distributor sales presence in the United States and in 54 countries outside the United States. We have dedicated spinal implant and INR sales teams in place and are in the process of assembling an exclusive orthopedic trauma sales team. We expect to continue to increase the number of our direct and distributor sales representatives in each of these three areas, both in the U.S. and internationally, to expand into new geographic territories and to deepen our penetration in existing territories. We believe the expansion of our U.S. and international sales forces provides us with significant opportunities for future growth as we continue to penetrate existing geographic markets and enter new ones.
Our spinal implant sales representatives, which comprise the bulk of our overall sales force, are present in the operating room during most surgeries in the United States and in many, but not all, of the other countries in which our products are sold. These representatives have the responsibility to confirm that all of the items needed in the surgery are available and are provided sterile or are capable of being sterilized at the hospital. Various sizes and quantities of implants are made available to be able to satisfy varying surgical requirements and patient anatomy, along with numerous surgical instruments and cases needed to safely perform the surgery and implantation. As products are used in surgeries, replacement items are shipped to our sales representatives and hospitals to replenish their supply.
All of our independent distributors are compensated solely on commission. Most of our new direct sales representatives start with a compensation arrangement that is largely based on salary. Our goal is to have members of our direct sales force move toward a compensation model based solely on commission as they become familiar with our products and drive higher sales.
Advancement of Musculoskeletal Care
We are committed to the advancement of musculoskeletal care through our support of numerous educational and research programs geared towards surgeons, such as:

• | national and regional educational courses;


• | intensive hands-on cadaveric training on new products and new techniques;


• | research collaboration and support;


• | educational support; and


• | fellowship support.

Globus devotes significant resources to training and educating surgeons in the safe and effective use of our products and techniques. To that end, we have made significant investments in the creation, staffing and program offerings of our Musculoskeletal Education and Research Center (“MERC”). Through MERC, educational and training programs are offered at our modern bioskills laboratory and 100-person lecture facility, and through regionally-based didactic education and cadaveric bioskills training programs at off-site facilities.
10

Globus has a strong commitment to research performed in conjunction with surgeons from around the world as well as research opportunities in collaboration with leading academic institutions. Supported by a large, focused research team, these efforts range from basic biomechanical testing conducted internally with our six-degrees-of-freedom machine to major clinical outcomes studies. We are committed to providing the orthopedic surgeon community with high quality research to support the new surgical techniques and novel product designs that we develop.
Competition
We believe that our significant competitors are Medtronic, the DePuy Synthes Companies (a division of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker and NuVasive. Wright Medical Group, Orthofix International, Zimmer Biomet, K2M, Mazor Robotics and other smaller public and private companies are also competitors of ours. At any time, these or other market participants may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products. They may also develop and patent processes or products earlier than we can, or obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing products more rapidly than we can.
We compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business.
Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition. Many of our current and potential competitors are major medical device companies that have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, and they may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly longer operating history and more established reputations than we do. The markets we compete in are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. Our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, and are safer, less invasive and more effective than alternatives available for similar purposes. Because of the size of the potential market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products.
Manufacturing and Supply
We have greatly expanded our dedicated in-house manufacturing capabilities. A significant portion of our implant products is manufactured in our facilities in Eagleville, Pennsylvania. Most of our regenerative biologics products are processed in our facilities in San Antonio, Texas, and in Audubon, Pennsylvania. The ExcelsiusGPS™ robotic guidance and navigation system is assembled in our facility in Methuen, Massachusetts.
Most of our products are generally manufactured through a network of over 100 third-party suppliers. Our suppliers utilize high precision, computer-aided manufacturing equipment to manufacture our products. We have focused on developing a strong supplier base as part of our manufacturing strategy. Our relationship with our suppliers enables significant interaction between our design engineers and project managers and the suppliers’ engineers and schedulers to work through issues arising during the entire product development cycle. Many of our suppliers are domestic, which affords our engineers and other members of our product development team the opportunity to work closely with them to commercialize our products.
11

We select our suppliers carefully and generally use a small number of suppliers for each of our key products for added reliability.  Our internal quality assurance group evaluates the potential vendor through a formal vendor approval process before we enter into a relationship with the vendor. Suppliers that meet our internal quality assurance standards are added to our approved supplier list. All of our suppliers that provide us with implants or human tissue are ISO-13485 certified, meaning they meet the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) requirements for the manufacture of medical devices, and/or are accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks. Our quality assurance group conducts periodic audits to ensure continued compliance with our standards. With every shipment of inventory that we receive, our suppliers provide a certificate of compliance with our quality control standards. Our receiving group also performs inspections, packaging and labeling onsite at our headquarters facility.
We work closely with our suppliers to ensure that our inventory needs are met while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements, and we have not experienced a meaningful backlog of sales orders. We believe our supplier relationships and facilities will support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future.
A majority of our product inventory is held primarily with our sales representatives and at hospitals throughout the United States. We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory which is maintained with our field representatives and hospitals in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors, including demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels.
Intellectual Property
We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods. In particular, we rely on patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and also utilize nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our rights.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned 691 issued U.S. patents (675 utility patents; 16 design patents) and had applications pending for 517 U.S. patents (508 utility patents; 9 design patents), and we owned 227 issued foreign patents and had applications pending for 275 foreign patents. Our issued patents expire between November 2019 and May 2036.
Our trademark portfolio contains 188 registered trademarks and 102 pending trademarks. Our portfolio includes domestic and foreign trademarks with associated logos and tag lines.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
We expect that, in the future, sales volumes and prices of our spinal implant and orthopedic trauma products may grow to be more dependent on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Worker’s Compensation as well as private insurance plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and commercial insurers. Reimbursement is dynamic and is contingent on coding for given services or procedures, coverage by third-party payors, and adequate payment for the services or procedures.
Physicians use Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT®”) codes to bill for services and procedures, which are established by the American Medical Association (“AMA”). Specialty societies such as the North American Spine Society, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the American Academy 
12

of Orthopaedic Surgeons provide advice to the AMA CPT® Editorial Panel for developing codes. The availability of existing codes to bill for services and procedures may impact the adoption of technology. For example, the deletion of the CPT® code to report spine cages and subsequent addition of three new CPT® codes, two of which include integral anterior instrumentation, may impact the type of devices used by physicians to perform spine procedures.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the National Center for Health Statistics are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (“ICD-10-CM/PCS”) procedure codes used by physicians for reporting diagnosis(es) and hospitals for reporting inpatient procedures. ICD-10-CM/PCS was implemented in the U.S. on October 1, 2015. This represents the first major coding change for ICD coding in over 30 years. The granularity and specificity of the new ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system may impact reimbursement in the future, particularly hospital inpatient reimbursement. Physician and hospital coding is subject to change, which could impact coverage and reimbursement and thus potentially impact physician practice behavior.
Independent of coding status, third-party payors may deny coverage based on their own criteria. Payor medical policies continue to become more restrictive. Payors may deem the clinical efficacy of a device or procedure to be experimental or investigational, not the most cost-effective treatment available, or used for an unapproved indication. For example, Aetna’s Clinical Policy Bulletin for invasive back pain procedures includes an Appendix which lists covered and non-covered spine devices by brand name and manufacturer. Aetna continues to revise its policy to include devices as covered and non-covered. Aetna considers “expandable” cages to be covered for only limited indications (e.g., L5-S1 fusions). Additionally, many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts established by CMS for the Medicare program as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicare continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. National and local coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior. We will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients, physicians, hospitals, and insurers in order to promote the best patient care, provide clarity regarding coverage and reimbursement policies, and work to reverse any non-coverage policies.
For federal/state programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state. Some state Medicaid programs may not reimburse an adequate amount for the procedures performed with our products, if any payment is made at all. In addition, state-level worker’s compensation coverage and reimbursement vary from state to state. Payment by Medicare and other third-party payors may not be adequate to cover the cost of medical devices used in spine procedures. Additionally, more spine procedures are being performed in the hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings, in part due to innovation. Reimbursement levels in these settings are typically lower than for the hospital inpatient setting and may not be adequate to cover the cost of innovative and novel medical devices.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and some countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third-party payors, that coverage and reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that 
13

future legislation, regulation, coding or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulations. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
Our products are medical devices and human tissue products subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:

• | product design and development;


• | product testing, manufacturing and safety;


• | post-market surveillance and reporting;


• | product labeling;


• | complaint handling;


• | post-market approval studies; and


• | product advertising, marketing and promotion.

14

FDA’s Pre-Market Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States requires either 510(k) clearance, clearance of a de novo classification petition, or a pre-market approval (“PMA”) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose low or moderate risk are placed in either Class I or II. Unless classified as exempt from pre-market notification, Class I and II devices generally require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, which typically requires approval of a PMA application. For certain Class III devices that present low to moderate risk, a risk-based classification determination can be requested in accordance with the de novo petition process, under which the FDA may determine that the product can be appropriately regulated as a Class I or II device. Both 510(k) pre-market notification and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. Future legislation may impose user fees for the submission of de novo classification petitions. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing.
Human Cell, Tissue and Cellular and Tissue Based Products
We currently distribute a number of products processed from human tissue, some of which are manufactured by third-party suppliers. FDA regulates human tissue products as Human Cells and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (“HCT/Ps”). Certain HCT/Ps are regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and are referred to as “Section 361 HCT/Ps,” while other HCT/Ps are subject to FDA’s regulatory requirements for medical devices or biologics. Section 361 HCT/Ps do not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, or other premarket approvals from FDA before marketing. Tissue banks that handle HCT/Ps must register their establishments with FDA, list their HCT/P products with FDA, and comply with FDA donor eligibility and screening, current Good Tissue Practice (“CGTP”), product labeling, and postmarket reporting requirements for HCT/Ps.
The FDA periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the CGTP regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities.
The procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to U.S. federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (“NOTA”), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including bone and related tissue, for “valuable consideration.” NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. With the exception of removal and implantation, we provide services in all of these areas.
The procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to NOTA. In addition, some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state.
15

FDA Enforcement
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

• | untitled letters or warning letters;


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;


• | recall or seizure of our products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing our request for 510(k) or de novo clearance or PMA of new products;


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs that are already granted;


• | refusal to grant export approval of our products; and


• | criminal prosecution.

We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of Compliance, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal tissue licensing regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
International
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. The European Union/European Economic Area (“EEA”) requires a CE mark in order to market medical devices. Many other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, accept CE or FDA clearance or approval. Other countries, such as Brazil, Canada and Japan, require separate regulatory filings.
In the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification.
Additionally in the EEA, the procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells is subject to the requirements of the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing Directive 2004/23/EC, Directive 2006/17/EC and Directive 2006/86/EC.
16

Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing the EU Medical Device Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
In 2020, the EEA Member States will implement the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745), which will replace the current EU Medical Device Directive that governs medical devices in the EEA. All medical device companies manufacturing and/or marketing products in the EEA, including Globus, will be required to comply with the new regulation, which increases technical documentation requirements and may alter the classification of some products. Most devices that are CE marked under the EU Medical Device Directive prior to 2020 will continue to be marketed in the EU under certain conditions until 2024, at which point these products must comply with the new regulation.
We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the Notified Body (an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments), as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
Sales and Marketing Commercial Compliance 
Federal anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties.
The United States and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including under the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act and increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).

Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively “PPACA”) also imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
Environmental Matters
The manufacture of certain of our products, including our allograft implants and products, and the handling of materials used in the product testing process, including in our cadaveric laboratory, involve the controlled use of biological, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and wastes. Our business and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of, and exposure to, such materials and wastes. In addition, under some environmental laws and regulations, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites even if such contamination was not caused by us.
We are not currently aware of any material costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters, including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third-party waste disposal sites, that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. However, it is possible that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature. However, our sales may be influenced by summer vacation and winter holiday periods during which we have experienced fewer spine surgeries taking place. Our sales generally consist of products that are in stock in our warehouse facilities or maintained at hospitals or with our sales representatives. Accordingly, we do not have a backlog of sales orders.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had over 1,500 employees, including sales and marketing, product development, general administrative and accounting, both domestically and internationally. Our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement except in a single market outside the U.S., and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Properties
Our corporate headquarters are located in Audubon, Pennsylvania and owned by us. We own research and manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas, lease additional research and manufacturing facilities in Texas and also own a distribution center in Heerlen, Netherlands to support our international operations. We maintain sales and administrative offices in fifteen additional countries, all of which are leased.
