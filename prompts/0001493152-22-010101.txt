ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-----------+---------

 
When we use the terms “Kid Castle,” “KDCE,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the company,” we mean Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
 
Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (“Kid Castle,” “the Company,” “We,” “KDCE,” “Us” or “Our’) operates and manages a portfolio of real estate properties, digital assets, and other in-demand properties. Kid Castle engages in rollup and consolidation of real estate, Biopharma and digital economy assets and operations.
 
Kid Castle used to be a Florida corporation until the company voluntarily dissolved its Florida registration with intention to simultaneously incorporate in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation. Although the company immediately finalized its registration effort to convert into a Delaware Corporation, the company’s registered agent who was supposed to submit the registration package to the Delaware Secretary of State for certification, failed to make a timely submission. Later in January 2019, when the company realized that the Delaware incorporation/registration package/process was never submitted to the Delaware Secretary of State nor completed in any other way or form, the Company went ahead and resubmitted the required registration package and was then formally re-incorporated in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation. Thus, the company was formally incorporated in Delaware and converted into a Delaware Corporation in January 2019.
 
The re-incorporation in Delaware, which occurred in January 2019, has placed at risk, voidable and unenforceable, all and any liabilities that may have accrued, including any material agreements the Company may have executed during the period between March 22, 2011 and January 2019. To the best of our knowledge, no such liabilities that were accrued and no material agreement were entered into by the company during the period between March 22, 2011 and January 2019. In addition, there could be penalties or legal liabilities that may have accrued as a result of conducting business from 2011 to 2019 without properly registering with any State. To the best of our knowledge, as at November 27, 2020, no such penalties or liabilities has accrued to the company accrued as a result of conducting business from 2011 to 2019 without properly registering with any State. However, there is no guarantee that such penalties or liabilities would not accrue or arise in the future.
 
On January 21, 2020, we received notification about their decision to suspend trading in the securities of “Kid Castle Education Corporation (“KDCE” or “the company”) (CIK No. 1049011) due to questions and concerns about: (1) the adequacy and accuracy of publicly available information concerning KDCE’s current corporate control and its operations in the marketplace, including in filings with the Commission made on October 25, November 5, November 14, November 18, and November 27, 2019, as amended on December 6, 2019; and (2) recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the company’s stock, including, but not limited to, activity between October 25 and October 28, 2019.”
 
Upon the receipt of the notification, we called the number listed on the letter to speak with the SEC staff listed. We explained to them that our involvement with KDCE started on October 21, 2019 when gained control of KDCE, and that prior to that date, neither us nor any of our officers and shareholders own or sold shares of KDCE. We did not have any idea or information about whatever happened with KDCE and its common stock until October 21, 2019. We explained that by the time on the unusual price movement in the stock, we did not even have access to the shareholders’ list and none of our officers or directors has any shares of KDCE to sell. We spoke to three staff who told us to wait for a formal request from their office.
 
We received the form letter from the Division of Enforcement on February 18, 2020 to immediately preserve, and voluntarily provide them with, the information and documents listed on the request. We promptly complied with the request, gathered all the requested information and documents and submitted them to the SEC Division of Enforcement on March 2, 2020.
 
None of our current officers owned shares of KDCE prior to, and immediately after the transaction of October 21, 2019. None of our officers sold shares of KDCE during the period in question. Due diligence performed by our current officers and directors with respect to the acquisition of control of KDCE was limited to reading KDCE’s previously filed information on the SEC website. Our current officers and directors have no hand in the formation and corporate history until October 21, 2019. Our current officers and directors did not own of trade shares, or participate in the events leading to the suspension order.

Corporate History
 
Kid Castle Educational Corporation (“KDCE”) was the result of a share exchange transaction, commonly referred to as a reverse merger, pursuant to which shareholders of an offshore operating company take control of a U.S. company that has no operations (commonly referred to as a shell company), and the offshore operating company becomes a subsidiary of the U.S. company. In KDCE case, the offshore company was Higoal Developments Ltd., which was the parent company of Kid Castle Internet Technologies Limited and Kid Castle Education Software Development Co. Limited, KDCE’s operating companies that run our English language instruction business. The U.S. or shell company, at the time of the share exchange, was King Ball International Technology Corporation.
 
The details of KDCE corporate history are as follows. KDCE was incorporated in Florida on July 19, 1985 as Omni Doors, Inc. From inception through June 30, 1998, our primary business was the assembly and distribution of industrial doors for sale to building contractors in the South Florida market. Until April 6, 1998, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennia, Inc., a publicly-owned Delaware corporation. On April 6, 1998, the Board of Directors of Millennia declared the payment of a stock dividend to Millennia’s stockholders. Millennia stockholders received one share of our common stock for each four shares of Millennia common stock. This distribution of approximately 570,000 shares of our company represented approximately 5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.
 
Pursuant to a contract dated July 14, 1998, Millennia sold 10,260,000 shares (representing 90% of the total outstanding shares) of our common stock to an unrelated firm, China Economic Growth Investment Corp., LLC, which then distributed the shares to its three members, Yong Chen, Zuxiang Huang, and Zheng Yao.
 
On April 6, 2001, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated April 2, 2001, Halter Capital Corporation, a privately-owned Texas corporation, purchased 6,822,900 shares of our common stock from Zheng Yao, representing approximately 60% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with this change-in-control transaction, Sophia Yao, our then sole officer and director, resigned. Kevin B. Halter, Sr., as President and director, and Kevin B. Halter, Jr., as Secretary-Treasurer and director, were elected to replace her.
 
On June 19, 2002, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated June 6, 2002, Powerlink International Finance, Inc., a British Virgin Islands corporation, purchased 2,830,926 shares of our common stock from Halter Capital Corporation, representing approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with the purchase, the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Chin-Chung Hsu, President, Treasurer, and Director; Wen-Hao Hsu, Secretary and Director; and Chien-Hwa Liu, Director, were elected to replace them.
 
On June 25, 2002, we changed our name to King Ball International Technology Corporation and, on August 22, 2002, we changed our name again to Kid Castle Educational Corporation.
 
On March 29, 2010, the Company which has been a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange Commissioner (“SEC”), filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report. As a result of filing Form 15D, the Company was no longer required to file any SEC forms since March 29, 2010. Similarly, on March 22, 2011, the company voluntarily dissolved its Florida registration with intention to simultaneously incorporate in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation. The Company has been dormant since March 22, 2011and non-operating since March 29, 2010.
 
On October 21, 2019, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated October 2, 2019, Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., a California corporation, purchased one (1) million shares of its preferred shares (one preferred share is convertible 1,000 share of common stocks) of the Company, representing 97.82% of our total issued and outstanding voting shares of common stock and preferred stock. Simultaneously with the purchase, the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Frank I Igwealor, Chairman and CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director; Patience C Ogbozor, Director; and Dr. Solomon SK Mbagwu, MD, Director, were elected to replace them. Following the share sales to Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., the purchaser converted 900,000 of the preferred shares for 900,000,000 shares of the Company’s current outstanding shares of common stock.
 
Following the consummation of the October 21, 2019 transactions, the Company decided to restart filing important information immediately. The Company used the Form 10-12(g) to register its common stock with the SEC.
 
On September 15, 2020, Kid Castle Educational Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain corporation related to our President and CEO with respect to the private placement of 900,000 shares of its preferred stock at a purchase price of $3 in cash and a transfer of 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (a California Limited Liability Company). The shares were issued to the investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 based upon exemptions from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The issuances did not involve any public offering; no general solicitation or general advertising was used in connection with the offering. Community Economic Development Capital, is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, medical real estate investments, related commercial facilities, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services.
 
Similarly, on September 16, 2020, as part of its purchase of unregistered securities from certain corporation related to our President and CEO, the Company, received $3.00 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, and in exchange transferred 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (“CED Capital”), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), to GiveMePower Corporation, a Nevada corporation. This transaction gave the Company 88% of the voting control of GiveMePower.

On April 21, 2021, the Company sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), a California corporation, to Premier Information Management, Inc. for $1 in cash. As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the parent Company of GMPW, the 100,000 shares of KDCE preferred stock and 900,000,000 shares of KDCE common stock that CBDX bought in October of 2019. Pursuant to the April 21, 2021 transaction, CBDX ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 1, 2021.
 
On December 30, 2021, in exchange for its 87% control block in GiveMePower Corporation, the Company received 100% stake in Alpharidge Capital LLC from GiveMePower, in a cashless transaction, resulting in each public company going its separate way and an independent company.
 
Business Overview
 
Kid Castle engages in rollup and consolidation of real estate, Biopharma and digital economy assets and operations. The Company changed its CBD-focused business after selling Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. in April 2021, to refocus on acquisition and management of businesses and assets in real estate, Biopharma and digital economy. As the subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc. (NIHK), the Company’s business plan is to help NIHK to achieve its business plan. The Company therefore will focus on rolling up Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets and businesses in North America.
 
During the last quarter of 2019, we entered into nonbinding Letter of Intent (LOIs) with 5 CBD operations to acquire their businesses. None of these businesses sells or manages cannabis-related or marijuana related products. The businesses are focused on “Farm Bill” compliant Hemp-based CBD products. A “Farm Bill” compliant business is one that strictly cultivates and utilizes “hemp” as specified by the Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill legalized production of hemp for all… allowing for full-scale commercial production of hemp as provided in the Bill. https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/HempExecSumandLegalOpinion.pdf. Each of these businesses is producing revenue and each operation is profitable. With the LOIs in hand, we approached some professional finance guys to help us raise the money for the acquisition. There is no guarantee that we could raise the capital needed for this acquisition or that the sellers would wait for us to raise the capital.
 
Subsequently, as we were pulling together financing for the acquisition, COVID-19 exploded and crippled most business transactions across the world. As a result of the disruptions occasioned by COVID-19, the operations of our major financier coming from New York and London came under the lockdown. We have informed the sellers about this situation and advised that they move on to other potential acquirers as we are completely uncertain about the where things would be after the end of COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Because of COVID-19 we were unable to obtain the financing necessary to make the acquisition of the businesses mentioned above. There is no guarantee that we could be able to acquire one or more of those businesses. In addition, there is no guarantee that these businesses would still be available to us to acquire in the future, or at the initially contemplated price. As at the date of this filing, we believe that above targeted acquisitions would no longer be probable because of the impact of COVID-19.
 
Completed Acquisitions
 
Following the sale of the Cannabinoid Biosciences business unit, Kid Castle Educational Corporation, has not completed any acquisition so far.
 
Our Business Objectives and Growth Strategies
 
Our principal business objective is to maximize stockholder returns through a combination of (1) acquisition and rollup of profitable Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets across the United States of America (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased profits, which we hope to pass on to stockholders in the form of distributions, and (3) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our businesses through process optimization and financial engineering. However, because of COVID-19, we were unable to obtain the financing necessary to make the acquisition of the businesses we needed to acquire. There is no guarantee that we could be able to acquire one or more in the future. In addition, there is no guarantee that viable businesses would still be available to us to acquire in the future, or at reasonable price.
Mission Statement
 
Our vision is to acquire and rollup profitable Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets across the United States of America.

-


There is no guarantee that we could successfully make any acquisition or rollup. Our mission as stated above is only a guiding principle as we start our acquisition. We have never made any big acquisition prior to this moment. Although we have a theoretical picture of what our mission called for, none of our staff have ever done it previously.
 
STRATEGY
 
Keys to Success
 
Management Experience
 
Our experienced management team has a combined thirty-two years of successful experience in finance and legal experience in the United States. The Company intends to acquire and rollup profitable Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets across the United States of America as soon as it had raised enough capital to consummate an acquisition of such business operation that generates significant revenue. There are no guarantees that we would be able to raise the capital needed to make any acquisition, though.
Special Purpose Entities
 
When the Company does acquire businesses and operating assets, it intends to hold title to the properties through separate LLCs or through special purpose entities (“SPE’s”) holding several similar asset types. Each separate LLC or SPE will be a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. If a joint venture is undertaken, the Company will record a first position deed instead of holding actual title.

● | Each business/operation acquired is its own entity and is structured as its own business structure while the parent Company bundles all the ownership/control interests into a single corporation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Each business/operation is managed by its management team or authorized agents. 

Leverage
 
Leverage represents an important vehicle for maximizing returns. The Company will evaluate the appropriate amount of debt based on market conditions, feasibility of the project, and determined risk. The Company does not have any credit agreements with any lender as at the date of this filing. We may incur indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly or privately placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders. The indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Security may be in the form of mortgages or other interests in our properties; equity interests in entities which own our properties or investments; cash or cash equivalents; securities; letters of credit; guarantees or a security interest in one or more of our other assets.
 
The Company may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new businesses or operations, make other investments, trade in stocks, futures, options and forex, make payments to the officers and management, pay for capital improvements, repairs, refinance existing indebtedness, pay distributions or provide working capital. The form of our indebtedness may be long-term or short-term debt or in the form of a revolving credit facility.
 
Our Financing Strategy
 
As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings to fund acquisition, purchases and restructuring activities.
 
We do not have positive operating cash flow. However, we intend to make acquisitions that would generate positive operating cash flow in the near future. We intend to meet our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity and debt securities, including common stock and long-term notes. Where possible, we also may issue limited partnership interests in future Operating Partnership and use the proceeds to acquire businesses from existing owners. We expect to issue equity and debt securities at times when we believe that our stock price is at a level that allows for the reinvestment of offering proceeds in accretive business assets and property acquisitions. We may also issue common stock to permanently finance businesses that were previously financed by debt securities. However, since we have never done any of the above before, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to access the capital markets and to obtain other financing arrangements is also significantly limited by our limited experience in many of the industries that we target.
 
We may file a shelf registration statement, which would subsequently be declared effective by the SEC, which may permit us, from time to time, to offer and sell common stock, preferred stock, warrants and other securities to the extent necessary or advisable to meet our liquidity needs.

Risk Management
 
We intend to embrace geographic and portfolio diversification at acquisitions as our main risk management strategy. We intend to diversify the investment size and location of our portfolio businesses in order to manage our portfolio-level risk. Over the long term, we intend that no single business will exceed 25% of our total assets.
 
Above plan notwithstanding, we do not currently have any investment portfolio yet and there is no guarantee that we would be able to establish one in the future because the Company has limited or no resources at the present.
 
Competition
 
The current market for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets operations that meet our investment objectives is limited. In addition, we believe finding businesses that are appropriate for our specific purpose may be limited as more competitors enter the market.
 
These competitors may prevent us from acquiring desirable businesses or may cause an increase in the price we must pay for businesses. Our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do and may be willing to pay more for certain assets or may be willing to accept more risk than we believe can be prudently managed. In particular, larger companies may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Our competitors may also adopt transaction structures similar to ours, which would decrease our competitive advantage in offering flexible transaction terms. In addition, due to a number of factors, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets businesses may increase substantially, resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for these businesses. If we pay higher prices for businesses, our profitability may decrease, and you may experience a lower return on our common stock. Increased competition for businesses may also preclude us from acquiring those businesses that would generate attractive returns to us.
 
Insurance
 
We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family businesses industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the real estate industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
 
Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, general liability and workers’ compensation. We believe that our insurance coverages adequately insure our multifamily businesses against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, terrorism and other perils, and adequately insure us against other risk. Our coverage includes deductibles, retentions and limits that are customary in the industry. We have established loss prevention, loss mitigation, claims handling and litigation management procedures to manage our exposure.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become subject to, material seasonal fluctuations.
 
Trademarks
 
We do not own any trademark or patents As of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s employees comprised six (6) employees who managed the affairs of the parent corporation and the operations of the subsidiaries. On an as needed basis, the Company hires independent contractors to perform specific tasks related to the Company’s business interests.

We have restarted filing annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet from the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
