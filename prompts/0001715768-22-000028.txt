Overview
We are a global semiconductor company founded in 2007. We are a pioneer, and a market and technology leader, in the wide-bandgap GaN power electronics field for high voltage power conversion applications. We deliver high quality and reliable GaN devices with high performance, while providing application design support to a growing customer base. Our GaN devices allow customers to design smaller, lighter and cooler power systems creating increased functional value in end products including smartphone power adapters/fast-chargers, power supplies for datacenter servers/communication, industrial power converters and chargers/converters/inverters for electric vehicles, among other applications. We deploy our unique vertically integrated innovation model that leverages one of the industry’s most experienced GaN engineering teams (with over 300 years of combined experience) at every development stage: device design, materials growth, device fabrication, packaging, circuits and application support. This approach, backed by one of the GaN power industry’s largest intellectual property portfolios with access to over 1,000 world-wide patents, has yielded the industry’s first automotive-grade AEC-Q101 and JEDEC qualified high voltage GaN FETs. Our innovations are designed to move power electronics beyond the limitations of silicon and provide our customers with higher efficiency or lower loss (e.g., titanium-class performance in power supplies), higher power density (e.g., compact size or improved form factor) and, in many designs, an overall lower system cost.
Recent Developments
On April 20, 2021, we changed our fiscal year from the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 to the period beginning on April 1 and ending on March 31 of each year, effective for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. On June 24, 2021, we filed a transition report on Form 10-K for the transition period from December 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021.
Our Technology
Driving “Moore’s law of Power” with GaN: At the core of any power converter or inverter widely utilized in converting electrical energy from one form to another (for example, AC to DC), are semiconductor-based electronic switches, traditionally made with silicon-based devices. While silicon and silicon-based switching transistors like MOSFETs and IGBTs are reaching their technological limits, GaN FETs have significant potential for performance to further the roadmap for power conversion systems that require ever increasing power density (ability to pack power in a small volume), analogous to Moore’s law for digital semiconductors. In this case, the “Moore’s law” analogy is the increasing power density over time, which has been achieved via improvements in switching devices, starting with SCRs, then BJTs, followed by IGBTs and MOSFETs, all of which are silicon-based devices. Relative to silicon-based devices, GaN devices offer advantages including higher switching speeds, higher breakdown voltages and lower resistance. Today, wide-bandgap semiconductors like SiC and GaN are driving the innovation in power electronics.
Our GaN FETs: Our proprietary GaN on silicon material growth (or epiwafer technology) knowhow via MOCVD allows us to build our GaN devices on inexpensive silicon substrates, thereby leveraging the cost structure of well-established silicon-based manufacturing. Our proprietary GaN epiwafer designs also allow us to achieve devices capable of sustaining high voltages well in excess of the 650 Volts required for typical power switching applications, with ultra-low losses. At the core of our GaN FET device is a two-chip, normally-off 650 Volt GaN platform, integrating a low voltage Si FET input/drive stage with a high voltage GaN output stage to deliver a normally-off, packaged power device to the end user. Compared to other approaches by which a normally-off, high voltage GaN switching device can be made, our approach is more robust than other alternatives (so-called junction 
gated or p-GaN type devices) that typically offer low safety margins. A typical standard Si-MOSFET consists of a normally-off input portion (gate control) with a normally-on output portion (high voltage drift region), that are integrated in one device. We have integrated two separate die in one package in a chip-on-chip configuration to achieve the best of both worlds - high robustness and high performance. The result is a normally-off power device package with a combination of reliability, robustness, design margin and performance. We believe the adoption of this approach by other GaN manufacturers makes our strong intellectual property even more important going forward. Our GaN FETs stand out in the industry due to their capability to withstand much higher voltages than those required for device ratings (for instance, our standard 650 Volt products have a destructive breakdown voltage in excess of 1,000 Volts, which we believe is high in comparison to the typical range for our competitors’ GaN devices of 650 Volts to 1,000 Volts), contributing to our safety margins in operation.
Continued Innovation: We have a strong innovation track record as evidenced by a series of firsts in the GaN high voltage arena, including the first automotive-grade AEC-Q101 and JEDEC qualified high voltage GaN FETs. We have also released multiple generations of products beginning with Gen-1 and Gen-2 prior to 2016, Gen-3 in 2018, Gen-4 in 2020 and Gen-5 in 2021. Each product platform seeks to improve key industry metrics (or figures of merit) designed to result in both improved performance (lower losses in power converters/inverters for our customers) and lower cost by enabling lower die size and simpler packages.
Epiwafer Products: We also monetize our strong core expertise in GaN epiwafer technology by providing GaN epiwafer products for the RF/microwave/millimeter wave market, as well as for certain strategic customers in the power device market. In 2018 and 2019, we were awarded the base portion and option portion, respectively, of an $18.5 million contract by the U.S. Navy, which we believe is validation of our technology, intellectual property and capability in this area. We believe this program will establish ourselves as a U.S.-based supplier for advanced GaN epiwafer products for both the U.S. Department of Defense and commercial applications. In 2021, we were independently awarded a separate and standalone $1.4 million contract by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – this is an R&D activity that could in the long term develop GaN technology.
Our Solution and Business Model
Our GaN product offerings are based on innovation across the value chain, starting from GaN material and epiwafers to GaN device design, and from wafer fabrication to packaging, as well as application-based reference designs that help our customers extract the most value from GaN. This vertically integrated control of the value chain has resulted in rapid innovation, manufacturing control, and the high quality, high reliability (Q+RTM) brand of high voltage GaN offerings that we offer.
Target Power Market Focus: Our GaN on silicon FET products start with a 650 Volt rating and currently go up to 900 Volts, and we have demonstrated products that will go up to 1,200 Volts. 650 Volt products represent a large portion of the power conversion market because the world-wide line voltage into which these converters have to plug in ranges from 110 Volts to 240 Volts, resulting in in-system voltages of 400 Volts to 500 Volts that necessitate a 650 Volt power device. Similarly, higher bus voltage applications such as those running off an 800 Volt electric vehicle battery for an inverter require higher voltage ratings from power devices. As the voltage requirement gets higher, a silicon-based power device switch becomes increasingly lossy and the differentiation in performance offered by a GaN device increases. 
Products: Our products currently address power conversion applications ranging from approximately 30 watts to approximately 30 kilowatts in multi-phase applications. Our GaN FETs are offered in various packages, addressing our customers’ needs from very robust to compact packages. In addition to the appropriate device, a robust and easy-to-use package is key for a power product because the heat dissipated in the device ultimately is removed via the package and then the system heat sink. TO packages have historically served a significant role in the power semiconductor industry. We have designed our GaN products in these TO packages to deliver kilowatt class power that takes advantage of GaN’s high efficiency and low loss switching capability along with a solid thermal interface offered by the TO package. We also offer surface mount equivalents of the TO packages such as the D2Pak, where surface mount capability is a must. On the other hand, for fast switching compact power adapters (typically sub-300 watt), the compact PQFN package is our standard offering. Our packaged products also 
incorporate simple but powerful high frequency and high speed switching design philosophies, resulting in GaN solutions with stable operation at multi kilowatts, at high-speed and high frequency (multi-100 kHz to MHz), all while maintaining high quality and reliability.
Markets: Our GaN products switch much faster than equivalent silicon products and increase a system’s power density, producing greater efficiency while enabling system size reduction. With their proven reliability and ability to reduce size and save energy, 650 Volt GaN FETs have now been adopted in the market. GaN provides cost-competitive, easy-to-embed solutions that reduce energy loss and system size by as much as 40 percent, while enabling system cost reduction, to simplify converter and inverter design and manufacturing.
Our products today address power conversion applications including: 
•low power applications (approximately 30 watt to 300 watt) such as smartphone power adapters/fast chargers and laptop and appliance power supplies;
•medium power applications (approximately several hundred watts to 3 kilowatts) such as power supplies for gaming, appliances, datacenter servers, communications infrastructure, and industrial servo drives for motors and robotics; and
•high power applications (approximately 3 kilowatts to over 5 kilowatts) such as blockchain applications, higher power datacenter servers, uninterruptable power supply/energy applications, onboard chargers, converters and inverters for electric vehicles, and power supplies for industrial applications.
We believe power conversion with high voltage semiconductor devices (e.g., 650 Volt devices) is a large market opportunity. Based on reports from various third party research firms, we estimate the total addressable market for GaN to be approximately $1.6 billion. Market research firm Yole Développement predicts growth for the GaN power device market with GaN power semiconductor-related revenues as high as $400 million by 2023.
In addition to the power semiconductor market, we have started supplying GaN epiwafers on various substrates, including silicon carbide, sapphire and silicon, ranging from 4 to 6 inches in diameter, for RF/microwave/millimeter wave device markets, and we believe we are in a position to target the growing 5G RF market in the future. We believe the existing market for GaN RF transistors for wireless infrastructure and 5G exceeds $800 million, and we can service a portion of this market attributed to epiwafers. For these areas, we also have the advantage of being a pure-play epiwafer foundry as we do not make RF device products.
Our History
Overview: Our company was launched in 2007 by founders Professor Umesh Mishra and Dr. Primit Parikh, with more than 30 years of GaN technology and business experience between them at the time, with the goal of commercializing GaN technology for the large power semiconductor market while making a global impact on electrical energy savings and simplifying power conversion for end users. We have been a key player in the area of high voltage GaN power devices from our early days with several industry firsts, including the first GaN on silicon device to the first 600 Volt GaN device JEDEC qualification, the first high voltage GaN automotive qualified product under the stringent AEC-Q101 standard, the first high temperature (175C) rated GaN offering, and the first comprehensive field reliability data, now including over 40 billion hours of operation with a statistical failure rate of <0.3 FIT (0.3 per billion hours of operation).
Blue Chip Partnerships: Throughout our history, we have established blue chip partnerships with strong investors, manufacturing and channel partners, key customers, and strategic investors and partners. For the year ended March 31, 2022, Nexperia B.V. (“Nexperia”), the U.S. government and one other overseas customer each accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues. For the year ended March 31, 2022, such customers together accounted for 78.1% of our revenues. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, Nexperia and the U.S. government each accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues. For the three 
months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, such customers together accounted for 58.5% and 88.8% of our revenues respectively. 
In 2014, we established a business integration, IP acquisition/licensing and channel partnership agreement with Fujitsu Limited (“Fujitsu”) and Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited (“FSL”), pursuant to which we established Transphorm Japan as a wholly owned subsidiary, with a leading manufacturing and quality team from FSL. In connection with this agreement, we entered into a manufacturing partnership for AFSW, FSL’s high quality 6-inch silicon wafer fabrication plant in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, which allowed us to bring silicon-like manufacturing excellence to GaN products. We also acquired a patent portfolio from FSL and a license to a separate portfolio from Fujitsu. This relationship further led to the establishment in 2017 of a joint venture with FSL for AFSW, in which we were a noncontrolling partner with a 49% interest. In August 2021, GaNovation Pte. Ltd. (“GaNovation”), a Singapore-based joint venture entity between us and JCP Capital Management, LLC Limited, acquired all of our and FSL’s interests in AFSW. We currently hold a 25% interest in GaNovation. For the year ended March 31, 2022, GaNovation’s primary business activity related to the businesses of AFSW.
In 2015, KKR Phorm Investors L.P. (“Phorm”), an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., made an investment of $70 million in us with the goal of enabling us to get our GaN products that had completed concept, engineering, manufacturing, reliability and quality testing to mass market. As of the filing of this Report, Phorm remains our largest stockholder. 
In 2017, we entered into a partnership with Yaskawa Electric Corporation of Japan (“Yaskawa”), a global leader in motion control and a pioneer in the adoption of new semiconductor technology for the field of servo motors, robotics and renewables. In October 2017, Yaskawa loaned us $15.0 million pursuant to a convertible promissory note, and in October 2021, Yaskawa converted the note into 3,120,000 shares of our common stock. Yaskawa seeks to enable smaller, faster and more efficient power electronics servo drives in applications such as robotics, which use servo motors to enable movement along various axes of motion in a robot, to improve robot functions.
In December 2020, we entered into a cooperation and development agreement with Yaskawa, pursuant to which Yaskawa agreed to provide $4.0 million over approximately three years to fund development activities related to industrial power conversion applications, with an initial focus on us developing customized versions of our GaN devices for servo motor drive applications. As of March 31, 2022, Yaskawa has provided $1.8 million of this commitment.
In 2018, we established a five-year multi-element cooperation agreement with Nexperia, a leader in silicon-based power semiconductors for automotive products, with the goal of establishing a second source of our GaN products and better positioning to penetrate the automotive market with our GaN products in the long term. Through a combination of equity ownership, a loan agreement, technology development projects, and licensing of our wafer-fabrication process and certain products, we secured significant funding from Nexperia. We believe this agreement is indicative of our strong intellectual property portfolio as well as our ability to create revenue streams by monetizing our intellectual property. In May 2021, we amended the cooperation agreement with a view towards a longer term supply relationship with Nexperia. See the section titled “—Nexperia Cooperation Agreement” below.
In 2020, we established a relationship with Marelli, a leading automotive Tier-1 supplier (headquartered in Japan and with a world-wide footprint) for long term development of our automotive converter and inverter products. As of March 31, 2022, Marelli has made equity investments in us totaling $5.0 million.
In December 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement with JCP Capital Management, LLC Limited (controlling party with 75% ownership as of March 31, 2022) to create GaNovation, a joint venture company in Singapore, to engage in the business of distribution, development and supply of GaN products and any business relating to the businesses of AFSW. In connection with the establishment of GaNovation, we appointed GaNovation (including one of its affiliates) as our exclusive distributor in Greater China, with rights to procure processed GaN wafers and other components from us, rebrand and resell packaged products purchased from us, and customize and develop mutually-agreed-upon products. 
Customer Partnerships: Beginning in 2018, we have empowered our customers’ success and have seen numerous customers introduce their end power conversion products such as power supplies, battery chargers and fast charging adapters into the market. For example, Corsair, a leading supplier of high-performance gaming equipment, successfully introduced its AX1600i series of GaN-based power supplies. We estimate that the GaN products estimated to be operating now for several years have resulted in at least forty billion hours of combined field operations. As mentioned above, Yaskawa has partnered with us with a view of enabling GaN devices for servo drives in robotics applications. We have also developed partnerships with companies based in both Asia and the United States for GaN-based adaptor products. Recently we announced our partnership with Boco Electronics, which uses our GaN FETs for higher power blockchain computing power supplies. Lastly, in 2018 and 2019, the U.S. Navy awarded us the base portion and option portion, respectively, of an $18.5 million three-year contract to create a U.S.-based source of advanced GaN epiwafer materials for the U.S. Department of Defense, which we believe exemplifies the recognition of our strong GaN MOCVD epiwafer platform, intellectual property and manufacturing scale and creates an opportunity for us to sell into the broader GaN RF epiwafer market. This has helped us in developing a second vertical - our GaN epiwafer business - to supplement our primary business of GaN power products. In this area, we have started to sell epiwafers, targeting both customers within the U.S. Department of Defense (including those resulting from the impact of the U.S. Navy program as well as others) and commercial RF and power device customers.
We are dependent on revenues from certain key customers such as Nexperia and the U.S. government, and distributors who sell to Corsair, Bel Power Systems, Digikey, GaNext, Mouser and Xentris, as well as on revenues from sales of our epiwafer products to various customers engaged in research and development for the U.S. Department of Defense utilizing our GaN epiwafer products.
Commercialization
Current GaN Power Products: We have qualified and released to manufacturing a number of products based on our 650 Volt GaN FET technology. Our current product portfolio in the market is based on our 650 Volt Gen-1 to Gen-5 GaN FET platforms. Our products are offered in the industry standard TO packages (TO247 and TO220) or the 8x8 PQFN surface mount packages. The TO packages offer the most robust thermal performance and result in higher power per device, ranging from 1 kilowatt to over 5 kilowatt, and the PQFN packages offer the most compact and higher speed switching performance, typically for sub 2-kilowatt applications, including adapter applications. We also have a 900 Volt GaN FET product in the market and believe that we are the only company to have qualified a 900 Volt GaN device to date. The key markets that are currently addressed by our products include:
•Power adapters and chargers and gaming power supplies
•Data center, infrastructure power supplies, crypto mining and blockchain computing applications
•Industrial and energy applications - power supplies, uninterruptable power supply/battery chargers, servo drives
Additionally, we hope to enter the automotive products market in the mid-term, via DC-DC converters, on board chargers, and AC inverters for off-grid power, for which we are actively working with customers, and in the longer term, via EV power-train and high speed chargers after our development of larger current, higher power GaN devices. 
Application Resources: We develop reference designs and evaluation boards that help our customers incorporate our GaN devices into the design of their power conversion products. We also make our applications kits available on distribution sites such as Digikey and Mouser.
Gen-4 Products: Our Gen-4 platform further improves the industry metric of resistance per unit die area and enables simpler packaging. A summary of our released Gen-4 products is below: 
•650 Volt/Gen-4/240 mohm class GaN FET for 45 watt to 100 watt class adapters;
•650 Volt/Gen-4/150 mohm class GaN FET for 100 watt to 500+ watt class adapters and power supplies; 
•650 Volt/Gen-4/480 mohm class GaN FET for 24 watt to 50 watt class adapters; and
•650 Volt/Gen-4/35 mohm class GaN FET for kilowatt class general power conversion applications including data-centers, blockchain computing, industrial and automotive electric vehicle converters and chargers.
We have successfully commercialized Gen-4 products in 30 watt to 150 watt adapters and have the capability to provide reference design-based solutions for these power adapters. Our continued relationship with multiple design partners, as well as the expansion of our own application engineering team, is important for our success in the adapter market. Further, the success of our design-in with end customers is critical to us continuing to grow adapter revenues.
Higher Voltage, 900 Volt FETs: We believe we are the only company to have qualified 900 Volt GaN FETs. These products are used for power conversion applications that involve higher in-circuit voltages in excess of 600 Volts to 700 Volts or applications that run off a higher voltage battery. We released our Gen-3 JEDEC qualified commercial 900 Volt product in August 2020.
Automotive Products and Partners: Our GaN products are capable of being qualified for automotive applications following the AEC-Q101 standard. We have already AEC-Q101-qualified our Gen-2, Gen-3 and Gen-4 based products. Our revenues from automotive applications are dependent on our activities with certain Japanese automotive partners, including Marelli, as well as our non-contractual relationship with Nexperia, which plans to offer their automotive products both through licensing our technology and relying, in part, on us for epiwafer procurement. Success with Japanese automotive partners and Nexperia’s success in their automotive outreach would influence both the timing and ramp-up of our automotive revenues.
Epiwafer Business: We view our epiwafer business as a vertical that supplements our primary GaN power device business. In 2018 and 2019, we secured the base portion and option portion, respectively, of an $18.5 million three-year contract from the U.S. Navy for commercialization of GaN-based epiwafers on various substrates including silicon carbide, silicon and sapphire. This is a cost plus fee type contract with various milestones to be achieved by us. We began generating revenues from the sale of GaN epiwafers for the RF GaN market to the U.S. Department of Defense in 2020. We believe this contract with the U.S. Navy provides a strong base for our epiwafer business, though such business is not limited to defense customers as we will also be targeting commercial RF GaN epiwafer sales for the RF GaN market. 
Research and Development (“R&D”)
Our innovation is targeted at maintaining a leadership position in the GaN power device market. We completed development of our first Gen-5 products and will continue to develop more products based on customer needs. Further, we have also started working on our next improvement in figure of merit (a quality of semiconductor devices impacting performance limits) through our next-generation-based platform.
We are also exploring development of 1,200 Volt GaN devices, which is partly funded by a research sub-contract from the U.S. Department of Energy ARPA-E (Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy) agency, and recently demonstrated this technology. The research sub-contract ended on May 31, 2022.
Intellectual Property 
Proprietary Protection: Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to continuously obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our GaN products, associated solutions and other know-how, to operate without 
infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We have been building and are continuing to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our GaN products, including GaN products that can be used in the power conversion industry. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and licensing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed or licensed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be granted or licensed to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
IP Leadership: We are a world leader in GaN power semiconductor based intellectual property, with a patent portfolio that has access to over 1,000 patents comprising our directly owned patents, exclusive, sole or nonexclusive licenses of key portfolios from The University of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”), Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. (“Furukawa”) and Fujitsu, as well as a nonexclusive license from Cree, Inc. (“Cree”) for the field of GaN power devices. The strength of our portfolio lies in the fact that our intellectual property covers all aspects of the GaN value chain, ranging from GaN epitaxial materials to device design to wafer fabrication processes to packages as well as GaN-based circuits and applications.
Portfolio: Our patent portfolio includes pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States and in foreign countries. As of March 31, 2022, our owned and licensed patent portfolio consisted of over 850 issued patents and over 200 pending patent applications around the world. Our over 330 directly owned patents are complemented by 150 patents from Furukawa’s sole licensed intellectual property and 171 patents from Fujitsu’s nonexclusively licensed intellectual property in the power semiconductor area. The 26 patents exclusively licensed from UCSB include some fundamental early intellectual property on growth of GaN on silicon substrates and unique intellectual property on nitrogen polar GaN, which was pivotal to us being awarded the contract from the U.S. Navy. Additionally, we hold a nonexclusive license from Cree to over 300 GaN material/device patents. Our licenses for the UCSB, Furukawa and Cree patents are royalty-bearing, and we pay royalties based on total revenues. The license for the Fujitsu patents is not royalty-bearing. We have also sub-licensed the UCSB and Furukawa patents to Nexperia on a royalty-bearing basis, which helps us defray the cost of maintaining these intellectual property portfolios.
Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors under the patent laws. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country.
UCSB license agreement
We entered into a license agreement with UCSB in 2007. As of March 31, 2022, we had in-licensed 26 patents or patent applications under this agreement. The UCSB license agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with demand in the marketplace and industry conditions and development timelines, to research, develop, market and manufacture products that are licensed under the agreement. We have the right to sublicense these rights to third parties. The UCSB license is subject to the rights of the U.S. government under any and all applicable laws including substantially manufacturing all licensed products in the United States, unless such requirement is waived by the U.S. government. In addition, we have the obligation to pay UCSB’s patent prosecution and maintenance costs, as well as royalties at a low single-digit percentage of any net revenue generated by our sale of any licensed product. In the event we grant a sublicense under the licensed patent rights, we also have the obligation to pay UCSB a certain portion of the sublicense royalties equal to at least as much as would have been due from us to UCSB under the parent license. We have one sublicense in place for which we receive a certain portion of our maintenance fees and certain royalties, which will be passed on to UCSB. We may terminate this license agreement at any time by providing 90 days’ written notice to UCSB. 
Furukawa license agreement
We entered into a license agreement with Furukawa in 2014. As of March 31, 2022, we had in-licensed 150 issued patents in the U.S. and foreign countries under this agreement. We have the right to sublicense these rights to third parties. We share in the maintenance costs for the licensed patents by paying a fixed annual maintenance fee of $200,000, as well as royalties at a low single-digit percentage of any net revenue generated by our sale of any licensed product. In the event we grant a sublicense under the licensed patent rights, we also have the obligation to pay Furukawa a certain portion of the sublicense royalties. We have one sublicense in place for which we receive a certain portion of our maintenance fees and certain royalties, which will be passed on to Furukawa. Either party may terminate or renew this license agreement after ten years from entry into the agreement.
Fujitsu license agreement
We entered into a license agreement with Fujitsu in 2013. As of March 31, 2022, we had in-licensed 171 issued and pending patents in the U.S. and foreign countries under this agreement. We do not have the right to sublicense these rights to third parties. Under the terms of this license agreement, Fujitsu has no obligation to sue or enforce the patent rights against third party infringers. Our license from Fujitsu is fully paid up and royalty free worldwide, with nonexclusive rights for power electronics. This agreement is non-terminable.
Cree license agreement
We entered into a license agreement with Cree in 2013. As of March 31, 2022, we had in-licensed over 420 issued and pending patents in the U.S. and foreign countries under this agreement. We do not have the right to sublicense these rights to third parties. Under the terms of this license agreement, Cree has no obligation to sue or enforce the patent rights against third party infringers. We have the obligation to pay royalties at a low single-digit percentage of any net revenue generated by our sale of any licensed product. Either party may terminate or review this license agreement every three years.
Our Technology Licenses and Assignments
Our strategy for the protection of our proprietary technology is to seek worldwide patent protection with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global power semiconductor markets. However, we assess on a case-by-case basis whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain trade secret protection for our inventions and “know-how” rather than pursue patent protection. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed and the patent has not been invalidated. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened.
Although our current GaN products are based on the 2-chip, normally-off configuration, our intellectual property also includes patents on multiple approaches for the 1-chip, normally-off or the e-mode GaN device technology, including patents on the so called “p type” gated GaN device approaches.
As the GaN power semiconductor business grows, we expect to be in a strong position to demonstrate the strength of our intellectual property position to customers and to continue to monetize our intellectual property.
Trademarks and Trade Secrets: Trademarks form an important part of branding our products, the philosophy behind those products and the Company itself. Some of our key trademarks are the Transphorm logo (with the globe), Q+R (our Quality and Reliability brand) and SuperGaN (our highest performance new generation of GaN products). We also rely on trade-secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and we typically use non-disclosure agreements when commencing a relationship with a customer or partner, particularly when we believe we will share proprietary information. We have an internal program to document our trade-secrets for each major area of our technology and operations. We cannot be sure that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.
Licensing to Nexperia: As part of our long-term cooperation agreement with Nexperia and in exchange for Nexperia’s original investment in us, we agreed to transfer certain technologies to Nexperia and have provided Nexperia with licenses to manufacture and sell products using such technologies (in each case, excluding our epi process technology) as follows:
•Exclusive license (i.e., exclusive of us) for the automotive field in all regions except Japan, with the exception that we may develop, manufacture or directly sell any products in the automotive field to certain specified customers anywhere in the world (including Japan).
•“Sole” license for all other areas of application (i.e., we may not grant similar licenses to any other parties but we are not restricted from using or exploiting our technology in such other areas of application).
•The above licenses become nonexclusive on the earliest to occur of (i) April 4, 2023 and (ii) one year after a change of control of us.
•These licenses are ultimately contingent upon Nexperia fulfilling the appropriate licensing payment requirements, which in turn are contingent upon the execution of certain milestones by us. As of March 2022, the licenses were secured by Nexperia upon payment of the applicable licensing consideration by Nexperia and execution of milestones by us.
Competition 
Overview: Our solutions compete with other power semiconductor solutions for power conversion including other GaN products, SiC products and silicon super-junction and IGBT products. Both GaN and SiC belong to the wide-bandgap semiconductor materials category, which offer high power switching performance due to their inherent capability to switch with lower losses at high voltages. Our GaN products are targeted at the 600 Volt to 650 Volt and the 900 Volt markets today, addressing power levels from 30 watts to over 30 kilowatts.
Competition in our markets is based on a variety of factors, including cost, size, power consumption, performance, reliability, product line depth and breadth, and ability to supply in sufficient quantities. We believe we can, or will be able to, compete effectively based on these factors. 
Our GaN solutions compete with silicon-based products from companies such as Infineon, ST Microelectronics, Toshiba, ON Semiconductor and others, as well as with SiC based offerings from Rohm, Infineon, Wolfspeed, and others. SiC devices benefit from the fact that they are vertical devices while today’s high performance GaN devices are lateral devices. Vertical devices tend to offer smaller total chip area for similarly rated devices. However, GaN devices can make up for this size difference, at least in part, by being manufactured on a very low cost silicon substrate. We also compete with other high-voltage GaN product providers including Power Integrations, Infineon, Panasonic, GaN Systems, Navitas, Texas Instruments, Innoscience and others. 
Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, broader and deeper product portfolios, larger customer bases, substantially greater financial and other resources, and larger scale manufacturing operations. However, we believe our products have the potential to compete, and do compete, with many of our competitors’ offerings through product quality, product reliability and satisfaction of customer qualifications and standards.
Some companies as well as academic institutions are engaged in research and development of vertical GaN devices fabricated on bulk GaN substrates. While these could be promising in the future, much remains to be proven as to the ultimate quality and cost of these GaN substrates as well as the actual performance benefit of a vertical GaN device on a GaN substrate vs. high performance GaN HEMT-based products made on silicon substrates.
Competition With Silicon: We aim to capture applications that are traditionally addressed by silicon but for which silicon no longer offers sufficient performance. However, although the overall system cost may be lower with GaN due to compact size and reduction of other components in the system, the cost of certain GaN devices is higher than the cost of the comparable silicon devices at present (approximately twice the cost as such silicon devices). Therefore, in applications where silicon performance is acceptable, it may be difficult to compete with GaN products until the cost of the GaN devices is reasonably close to comparable silicon devices at a per device level. Typically, GaN devices face competition from silicon superjunction devices or silicon IGBT devices in such scenarios.
Competition With Silicon Carbide: Although SiC products have been around for a much longer time than GaN devices, we believe that GaN has better figures of merit with respect to certain power switching applications and the potential to deliver lower losses for such power switching applications. GaN is also made on standard silicon wafer substrates, lending it the cost structure of silicon-based wafer fabrication versus the more expensive SiC substrates on which SiC devices are manufactured. However, although the performance of SiC devices today at 600 Volts to 650 Volts is distinctly lower than GaN, SiC devices are more competitive at higher voltages such as 1,200 Volt nodes, where SiC is currently growing in use. This is due, at least in part, to SiC devices such as MOSFETs typically having a low mobility of electron charge under the gate region (such as approximately 50 cm2/Volt-second), versus GaN HEMTs which have much higher electron mobility in the gate region as well as the total conducting (or drift) region. For example, our GaN HEMTs have typical channel mobility of approximately 2,000 cm2/Volt-second. The lower gate mobility of the SiC MOSFET results in higher resistance (and thus higher loss) under the gate region. At lower voltages, the overall conduction (or drift) region is smaller and the gate region represents a higher portion of the total device. At higher voltages, such as 1,200 Volts, the gate region represents a smaller portion of the overall device and thus is not too detrimental for overall device loss. Thus, as the voltage requirement of a device is lowered, SiC devices generally tend to fall in relative performance versus GaN devices.
Competition With Other GaN Offerings: Finally, our GaN devices compete with offerings from other GaN manufacturers. While the presence of multiple GaN manufacturers is required for the overall acceptance of GaN technology, we strive to differentiate ourselves through quality, reliability, and easy to use GaN devices in thermally robust packages, while still offering a high level of performance (low loss and high efficiency) at reasonable price points.
Our Growth Strategy
Our growth strategies include (i) addressing growth in the power conversion markets through innovative GaN products with high quality and reliability that are easy to use, (ii) establishing an aggressive product and technology roadmap to improve product performance and decrease our costs, (iii) maintaining strong partnerships in what we believe are important product areas, and (iv) maintaining strong connections with suppliers, manufacturing partners, solutions partners and distribution partners. 
In the near term, we aim to continue to incorporate our products into power supplies by supporting product opportunities ranging from sub-100 watt compact smartphone fast-charging adapters to over 3 kilowatt power supplies for datacenter servers and blockchain applications with our GaN products. We continue to develop reference designs for various adapter solutions such as 65 watt to over 200 watt USB Type-C and other related fast chargers to provide customers a complete solution with our easy-to-use, high reliability GaN products. Adapters for fast chargers, which are prevalent with the increased power consumption of 5G mobile phones, represents a strong opportunity to market our GaN solutions. We aim to continue our partnerships with customers who have already introduced high-efficiency, compact, GaN-based power supplies in the market recently and to expand with more customers in this area.
In addition, we are addressing industrial markets such as industrial power supplies, servo motor drives for robotics, uninterruptible power supplies, and inverters and chargers for off-grid and backup power solutions, among other products. Our products come in standard packages that are thermally robust and capable of efficiently delivering 1 kilowatt to 5 kilowatts of power in a single package, which we believe are well suited for these types of products. We also develop reference designs for the applicable subsystems of power converters and inverters to ease 
product integration and help our customers derive additional benefit with GaN solutions. We have developed significant partnerships in this area, such as with Yaskawa in the area of servo motor drives.
The number of electric vehicles worldwide is expected to continue to grow from just over 3 million to over 30 million over the next decade. We believe that power conversion opportunities on board the automobile, such as on board battery charger and DC-DC converters for powering auxiliary systems, as well as the powertrain inverters, represent a strong market opportunity for GaN solutions. GaN-based devices can provide improvements in efficiency over traditional silicon devices, enabling compact systems for efficient charging and ultimately enabling higher driving range. In the mid term, our focus will be having customers design around our products in the areas of DC-DC converters (e.g., 3 kilowatt power) and onboard chargers (e.g., 6.6 kilowatt to 11 kilowatt power); we currently have products available to address these product areas. In the long term, we aim to address powertrain inverters with higher power ratings (e.g., 50 kilowatts to over 200 kilowatts) using innovative solutions such as combining multiple GaN devices and developing devices rated for higher power output. For example, we believe we are the only company to date to qualify and release a 900 Volt-rated GaN power device. We also have 1200 Volt rated devices at a demonstration stage.
We intend to continue to innovate in the GaN technology space to maintain our reputation in product quality, reliability and performance and to continue to improve the costs of our GaN products over time. We plan to offer these products in both robust, industry-standard packages as well as compact, surface-mount packages based on the power level and customer requirements.
As a result of our contract with the U.S. Navy, we are also positioning ourselves to be a supplier for high quality GaN epiwafers on various substrates such as silicon, silicon carbide and sapphire, in wafer diameters ranging from 4-inch and 6-inch now to 8-inch in the next few years. We aim to become a strong U.S.-based epiwafer supplier for GaN RF electronics for both the U.S. Department of Defense and commercial RF applications such as GaN RF transistors for wireless infrastructure and 5G. For these areas, we also have the advantage of being a pure-play epiwafer foundry as we do not make RF device products. We will also target providing GaN epiwafers for power semiconductor applications to select strategic partners and for select development opportunities.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Our primary set of products that include GaN power semiconductor FETs fall into the ECCN EAR-99 category of the export regulations from the U.S. Department of Commerce and as such are not currently subject to restrictions. We are required to conform to other guidelines and restrictions of the Department of Commerce and other government regulations that may be in place from time to time concerning shipping products to specific companies or countries. Our GaN epiwafers are classified under the ECCN 3C001 (GaN on silicon) and ECCN 3C006 (GaN on silicon carbide) category of export regulations, while our GaN on silicon epiwafer production and development technology falls under ECCN 3E001 of the regulations, and may require a license for export, re-export or transfer to a number of countries pursuant to EAR. We have systems in place to ensure our compliance with these guidelines and procedures and U.S. laws and regulations. Any exports of our technology for development or production of our epiwafers (under ECCN 3E001) to our own subsidiary in Japan and to AFSW, which is wholly owned by our joint venture GaNovation, is under the license exception TSR (technology and software under restriction). 
To the extent our products are or become subject to U.S. export controls and regulations, these regulations may limit the export of our products and technology, and provision of our services outside of the United States, or may require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations and conditions, including annual or semi-annual reporting. Export control and economic sanctions laws may also include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the importation of certain products, through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, and importation of our products and technology and the provision of services, including by our partners, must comply with these laws or else we may be adversely affected, through reputational harm, government investigations, penalties, and a denial or curtailment of our ability 
to export our products and technology. Complying with export control and sanctions laws may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent our products and technology from being provided in violation of such laws, our products and technology may have previously been, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us. Export or import laws or sanctions policies are subject to rapid change and have been the subject of recent U.S. and non-U.S. government actions. Changes in export or import laws or sanctions policies, may adversely impact our operations, delay the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and technology to certain countries, regions, governments, persons, or entities altogether, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our subsidiary in Japan, Transphorm Japan, also adheres to export control regulations under Japanese law, which generally mirror U.S. export control laws. Transphorm Japan has obtained licenses for the export of epiwafer materials to the extent required.
We are also generally subject to other industry and environmental regulations for electronic and semiconductor products such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC. 
Manufacturing and Supply
Supply Chain and Epi Materials: We believe we have strong manufacturing and supply chain operations in comparison to our competitors, from GaN epiwafers to wafer fabrication to packaging and testing. We control our core MOCVD GaN epiwafer manufacturing and development, with multiple MOCVD reactors at both our Goleta, California headquarters and our joint venture wafer fab in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan. Each location has multiple 6-inch production scale reactors, including some with 8-inch capability that we may require in the future. We believe these reactors, with the ability to grow high quality, high uniformity GaN epi materials on silicon, silicon carbide and sapphire substrates, provide sufficient capacity for epitaxial wafers both for our GaN power device business as well as our epiwafer sales vertical.
Wafer Fabrication and Joint Venture: Our wafer manufacturing as well as most of our engineering development is accomplished in our joint venture wafer fab in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan. AFSW has a fully depreciated 6-inch production fabrication facility, originally running silicon CMOS and bipolar processes and, since 2012, also running GaN processes while continuing some silicon-based wafer foundry activity. In November 2013, we entered into a process technology and development and services agreement with FSL to integrate our GaN power device manufacturing processes with FSL’s manufacturing processes to enable our GaN wafer manufacturing at what is now the AFSW fabrication facility. Since that time, we have gained full access to the facility for development and manufacturing of various generations of our GaN products. For example, we worked with FSL to qualify a complete manufacturing process for GaN wafers in the AFSW fabrication facility, which resulted in our products being commercially released in 2015 under our Gen-2 platform. Subsequently all our production supply of fabrication wafers has been sourced from the AFSW fabrication facility. 
In 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement with FSL to gain further control of our GaN manufacturing, share ownership and operating costs of the AFSW entity, and refine certain other aspects of our commercial relationship. Originally, we held a 49% interest, and FSL held a 51% interest, in this joint venture. On April 1, 2020, FSL exercised its put option under the joint venture agreement and notified us that FSL intended to exit the joint venture by selling its 51% interest in AFSW to us. In December 2020, we created GaNovation with JCP Capital Management, LLC Limited (the controlling party, with a 75% interest in GaNovation) to become a partner in AFSW. In August 2021, GaNovation acquired all of our and FSL’s interests in AFSW. We currently hold a 25% interest in GaNovation. For the year ended March 31, 2022, GaNovation’s primary business activity related to the businesses of AFSW. We have agreed to use our best efforts to maintain and continue the operations of AFSW until at least August 1, 2022, which we believe is synergistic with our own business for securing wafers for our products. For as long as we have had an ownership interest in AFSW, it has operated at a loss. If AFSW continues to operate at a loss (which we currently expect to be the case), our cash flows will be negatively impacted. 
The AFSW facility, which has a capacity of 14,000 CMOS process equivalent wafers per month, is capable of producing sufficient GaN wafers for our needs in 2022. We believe the AFSW facility can be scaled on demand in the mid-term, and is scalable to address our demand in the long-term over 5 years with increased investment in various standard semiconductor wafer fab equipment, typically acquired from used markets.
Backside Wafer Processing, Packaging and Testing: We contract with two third-party vendors to perform standard functions of back-side grinding and metallization in external facilities in Asia to complete the full wafer process. After these processes, the finished GaN wafers are transported to one of our packaging sub-contracting partners depending on the type of final package, where they are diced and finished into the final product. We have multiple sites in production for our PQFN packages and at present one site in production for our TO247, TO220 and D2Pak package. The final test portion of the supply chain is also in Asia, in many cases residing within our packaging sub-contractors.
Production Control: Our production planning and control process is centralized from our headquarters and integrated with our enterprise resource planning tools including NetSuite and manufacturing execution systems including WIPtrac. The entire process from forecasting and planning to order entry, then to build execution and inventory management, and finally to shipping, resides in the production control function. 
Sales
Our revenue consists of (i) perpetual licensing revenue, (ii) government revenue from our contract with the U.S. Navy and (iii) revenue from product sales. Products are sold to distributors and end-users in various sectors such as, but not limited to, the automotive, gaming, industrial, IT, consumer and RF (for our epiwafer products) industries.
GaN Products - Sales Process and Distributors: Our sales activity is primarily carried out in four broad based geographical regions (with significant focus in Asia) including key focus areas of (i) Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, (ii) the United States, (iii) Japan and, to a lesser extent, (iv) South Korea and Europe. We have offices in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Japan and the United States that include both sales and application engineering/customer support personnel. The field sales and applications effort is also supported by our senior factory applications engineering team from our California headquarters.
We partner with several regional distributors and sales representatives. In Asia, Avnet, Fujitsu Electronics (now part of Kaga Electronics), Common Power, Sino-American Silicon Products, Inc. and GaNovation are our current distributors, with GaNovation as the exclusive primary distributor for new accounts. In Japan, OSE, Kaga-FEI and Asahi Tech are our current distributors. In North America, Fujitsu Electronics is our current distributor, and in Europe, we have partnered with Hyline. Additionally, our products are available worldwide through Digikey and Mouser. We employ multiple regional representatives, primarily in the United States, on an as-needed basis. We also work with select design and development partners who make reference designs and system level solutions with our GaN products and are a part of our extended applications-oriented effort.
Markets and Design Cycles: For the year ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, our product and service revenue of approximately $12.2 million, $1.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, was comprised of sales into gaming power supplies, data center power supplies and infrastructure, power adapters, miscellaneous industrial applications and sampling revenue to automotive customers, including through our distributor Nexperia, and epiwafer sales. We expect revenue from product sales will increase in fiscal 2023, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2022. 
Design cycles for our products can be long and range from 6 to 18 months for the adapter/consumer market to 18 to 30 months for the datacenter and communication infrastructure market as well as industrial markets, to 3 to 5 years for the automotive market. Our sales funnel also classifies various opportunities in stages in the lifecycle at our customers including the stages of investigation, evaluation, dedicated board design, design-in, prototype and pilot production, before commencing full production.
Epiwafer Sales: Epiwafer sales are to U.S. Department of Defense customers for GaN on 4-inch and 6-inch wafers, for RF GaN on silicon carbide and sapphire substrates. Sales for GaN on silicon epiwafers for power devices to Nexperia under our long-term cooperation agreement are also included in this vertical. The epiwafer sales are carried out directly by us from our GaN MOCVD epiwafer department.
Marketing
Our target application markets for our GaN power products are power adapters and computing, datacenters and infrastructure, industrial and automotive. Our worldwide marketing efforts are coordinated out of our headquarters in Goleta, California and our offices in Campbell, California, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Key elements of our marketing efforts include:
•Participation and promotion in major power electronic tradeshows, conferences and events such as the Applied Power Electronics Conference in North America, PCIM Europe and PCIM Asia;
•Our website, which contains our product information, application notes and resources, evaluation boards, publications, events and various technical papers/white papers on wide-ranging topics such as quality and reliability, conferences, and presentations or papers; 
•Electronic and print trade media and outlet advertising;
•Utilization of social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram;
•Advertising on Digikey and Mouser, with analytical monitoring and search analytics; and
•Regular press releases and announcements. 
Nexperia Cooperation Agreement
In 2018, we entered into a five-year cooperation agreement with Nexperia, a stand-alone power semiconductor business spun out from NXP Semiconductors N.V., to secure funding for us and create a second source of supply for our GaN products or equivalent products, which certain customers may require to be available in the market for broader adoption of our products, and to enable a stronger long term outreach for the automotive market than possible with our own resources. Nexperia has begun promotion of their GaN products in the market, which is positive for the overall adoption of GaN solutions as well as for our business in particular, as Nexperia currently purchases epiwafers from us and has contracted to purchase epi material from us in the future when they produce their own epiwafers, as further described below. In connection with purchasing approximately $16.0 million of our Series 3 convertible preferred stock in April 2018, Nexperia entered into a set of cooperation agreements with us including a development and license agreement (“DLA”), loan and security agreement (“LSA”) and supply agreement. On May 18, 2021, we entered into two new agreements (a strategic cooperation agreement and an option agreement) with Nexperia, as well as amendments to the LSA, DLA, and supply agreement.
Development and License Agreement
On April 4, 2018, we entered into the DLA with Nexperia, pursuant to which we agreed to develop and transfer to Nexperia certain manufacturing process technologies (excluding our epi process technology) to enable Nexperia to manufacture GaN-based products at Nexperia’s facilities. Nexperia also agreed to provide funding for the development of such technologies in return for limited exclusivities in automotive and other fields. Key components of the DLA include:
•Foundry Transfer: The DLA required transfer of our existing Gen-3 wafer fabrication process to Nexperia’s wafer fabrication facility in Hamburg, Germany. We received $9.0 million of funds from Nexperia in relation to the transfer activity, associated intellectual property and projects completed to date. This transfer also creates a second source for GaN wafer fabrication, which we expect will 
facilitate broader adoption of GaN technology, as certain customers require multiple sources for risk mitigation.
•Technology Projects for “Pre-funded” Technology Loans and Licensing: Additionally, technology projects pertaining to our products and related activities were pre-funded by loans from Nexperia after we demonstrated that we had reached certain milestones (which have been completed). Such loans have been deemed paid off as the target milestones identified in the Statement of Work (SoW) of the DLA are complete. As the milestones have been completed and the loans deemed paid off, Nexperia has secured a license to the technology developed pursuant to the DLA. 
On May 18, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated development and license agreement (the “Amended DLA”) with Nexperia, pursuant to which granted Nexperia rights to sell products in the automotive field in Japan. Our rights to sell products in the automotive field in Japan remain in place under the Amended DLA. As per the original agreement, after April 2023, Nexperia’s exclusive rights for sale of products in the automotive field outside of Japan terminate. In addition, the parties have clarified the ability of Nexperia’s customers to use products developed by Nexperia through exercise of its rights under this agreement.
Loan and Security Agreement
The LSA, originally entered into on April 4, 2018, comprises term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million, separated into tranches for pre-funded projects and subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, and a $10.0 million revolving loan, each of which bears 6% annual interest. A number of amendments have since been made to the LSA. The current terms and status of the loans governed by this agreement are as follows:
•The term loans under the amended LSA include a $5.0 million Tranche A loan intended to pre-fund our Gen-4 technology development and a $8.0 million development loan intended to pre-fund our Gen-5 and 900 volts technology development. As of March 31, 2022, these loans were paid off.
•The $12.0 million revolving loan under the LSA, all of which was outstanding as of March 31, 2022, is secured against our U.S. non-MOCVD patents and is scheduled to mature at the earlier of (i) April 4, 2023 and (ii) the date a Change of Control (as defined in the LSA) occurs. Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the loans accrues at a rate of 6% per annum. 
Supply Agreement
Simultaneously with the DLA and LSA, we entered into a supply agreement with Nexperia, which was amended and restated on May 18, 2021. The supply agreement sets forth the terms under which Nexperia may purchase epiwafers and processed wafers from us, and we may purchase processed wafers from Nexperia. The agreement specifies that Nexperia is our priority customer with respect to epiwafers manufactured by Transphorm Japan Epi, Inc. and, accordingly, has preferred utilization of extra capacity, and further specifies procedures to address expansion of our epiwafer manufacturing capacity and Nexperia’s obligations with respect thereto. The term of the supply agreement is through December 31, 2025, with automatic one year renewals thereafter, and we may not terminate the supply agreement while the option agreement (described below) is in effect. 
Strategic Cooperation Agreement
The strategic cooperation agreement serves as a framework agreement that describes the numerous agreements between the parties and provides Nexperia with information rights and inspection rights with respect to our business.
Option Agreement
The option agreement establishes the parameters pursuant to which Nexperia, in certain limited instances, is permitted to exercise an option (the “Option”) to acquire Transphorm Japan Epi, Inc. (“TJE”), a Japanese subsidiary of ours through which we are engaged in the development, manufacturing and sales of Ga-N based epiwafer products. In general, the Option is exercisable upon (i) certain acquisitions of securities or assets of us or our subsidiaries by a Competitor (as defined in the option agreement) that results in us, directly or indirectly, owning less than a majority of TJE, which acquisition is followed by any material breach (that is not cured within a specified time period) by us or a subsidiary of our obligations with respect to epiwafer supply to Nexperia under our supply agreement with Nexperia, or (ii) the unilateral termination by us of the supply agreement. The option agreement also establishes the material terms, including price and timing, for the exercise of the Option by Nexperia. The Option terminates (i) if the Option is not exercised by Nexperia prior to the date on which the option agreement terminates, or (ii) on the first to occur of (a) the termination of the option agreement upon written agreement of the parties, (b) the mutual termination or expiration of the supply agreement, or (c) the first to occur of (1) two years following the date on which we notify Nexperia of epiwafer qualification of a second source and (2) April 1, 2028.
In connection with the option agreement, we also amended and restated our existing intracompany license agreement with TJE to clarify Nexperia’s rights upon exercise of the Option.
Employees and Human Capital
As of March 31, 2022, we had a total of 108 employees, of which approximately 88 are U.S.-based. We value and support hiring exceptional talent to develop our core technology and drive our business growth. None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
