Item 1. Business
Our Company
 
Nova LifeStyle, Inc. (“Nova LifeStyle” or the “Company”) is a U.S.-headquartered innovative designer and marketer of contemporary styled residential and commercial furniture formerly known as Stevens Resources, Inc. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 9, 2009. The Company’s products are marketed through wholesale and retail channels as well as various online platforms worldwide.
 
Nova LifeStyle’s family of brands includes Nova LifeStyle, Diamond Sofa (www.diamondsofa.com) and Nova Living.
 
Our business strength lies in our abilities to quickly adapt to changing market demand and stay ahead of the latest trends in modern furniture designs. Our customers principally consist of designers, distributors and retailers who cater to mid-level and high end private label home furnishings that have little product overlap within our specific furnishings products or product lines. Nova LifeStyle is constantly seeking to integrate new sources of distribution and manufacturing that are aligned with our growth strategies, allowing us to continually focus on growing our customer base as well as driving the expansion of our overall distribution and manufacturing relationships worldwide, providing our customers with trendy furnishing solutions.
 
We generate the majority of our sales as a branding and marketing company with vertically integrated third-party manufacturing capabilities for global furniture distributors and large national retailers. We have established long term relationships with our worldwide customers by providing them with high quality, large scale and cost-effective sourcing solutions. Our worldwide logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections tailored for their respective needs. Our experience marketing products to international customers have enabled us to fully integrate the supply scale, product delivery logistics, marketing efficiency and design expertise to address customer demand from established markets in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.
 
Reverse split
 
On December 18, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada with an effective date of December 20, 2019, at which time a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), was effected. All references to shares and per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect such split.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
We understand that our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain our employees. We strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs, learning and development opportunities that support career growth and advancement opportunities, and employee engagement initiatives that foster a strong Company culture. In addition to cash compensation, we offer customary benefits in accordance with local regulatory requirements as well as stock options to our employees. We also recognize the importance of keeping our employees safe. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and have followed local government orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As of December 31, 2021, we had 29 full time employees worldwide. Our U.S. corporate office and operations employed 25 full-time employees, our location in Malaysia and Hong Kong employed 3 and 1 full-time employees, respectively. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
Recent Developments Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak
 
Beginning in early 2020, a strain of novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spread globally including the U.S. and Malaysia. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. In response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has been following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and retail partners. The Company’s two showrooms and warehouse in Malaysia was closed from March, 2020 to May, 2020. The Los Angeles facility closed on March 16, 2020 and reopened in full operation on June 1, 2020. On May 12, 2020, the Company’s Kuala Lumpur office and warehouse reopened for business. On August 28, 2020, the Malaysia government extended the shutdown order to all business until March 5, 2021. After the re-opening on March 5, 2021, Malaysia government imposed a new nationwide lockdown on May 12, 2021 until early June 2021 which was subsequently extended to early October 2021. In October 2021, the Order was lifted for people who are fully vaccinated and our store has reopened. In April 2022, Malaysia has reopened the border for foreign visitors. The third-party contract manufacturers that the Company utilizes in China were closed from the end of January 2020 through the beginning of March 2020 and have been open for operation. Certain of the Company’s new products are being sourced from manufacturers in India starting in 2020. The factories in India suspended their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during March through early May 2020. Currently, the factories in India are open for operations. Shipping of products from Asia has experienced significant delays since the onset of the pandemic and the costs of shipping from Asia have increased since the onset; and we have experienced and may continue to experience shipping disruptions in the future. Finally, the Company expects that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the United States and world economies will continue to have a material adverse impact on the demand for its products. Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the future business interruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Our Products
 
We design and market modern residential and commercial furniture in diverse markets worldwide. Our products feature urban and contemporary styles, combining comfort and functionality in matching furniture collections and upscale luxury pieces appealing to lifestyle-conscious middle and upper middle-income consumers. We also sell physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia and other regions in Southeast Asia. Many of our products are segments of multi-component furniture collections in distinctive design styles, attractively priced in the medium and upper-medium ranges. Our product lines feature upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture pieces. We classify our products by room, designation or series, such as living room, dining room, bedroom and home office series, and by category or product types such as sofas, chairs, dining tables, beds, entertainment consoles, cabinets and cupboards. Our largest selling product categories for the year ended December 31, 2021 were sofas, beds and coffee table, which accounted for approximately 46%, 15% and 7% of sales from our continuing operations, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our largest selling product categories were sofas, beds and coffee tables, which accounted for approximately 52%, 14% and 8% of sales from our continuing operations, respectively. Our products are manufactured primarily from medium-density fiberboard, or MDF board, and particleboard covered with veneers or lacquers and combined with other materials, including steel, glass, marble, leather, jade and fabrics.
 


Our product offerings consist of a mix of furnishings designed by us, and sourced from third party manufacturers that are supervised under our rigorous quality control processes. Through market research, customer feedback, and ongoing design development, we identify the latest trends and customer needs in target markets to develop new products, collections and brands. Our product collections are designed to appeal to consumer preferences in specific markets. We develop both individual furniture pieces and complete furniture collections that equip an entire home which feature matching furniture suites, providing convenient home furnishing options for lifestyle-conscious consumers.
 
We generally introduce new collections and launch new design styles at international furniture exhibitions   or trade fairs. However, in 2021, due to Covid-19 pandemic, some international furniture exhibitions or trade fairs were cancelled, and for those were still held, the customers traffic was light. Our products are displayed in our showrooms. We further support our new product launches with product brochures and online marketing campaigns. Our staff collects customer feedback and collaborates with customers worldwide to design store and showroom layouts. In marketing materials, we highlight matching furniture collections by displaying complete and fully accessorized whole-room settings instead of individual furniture pieces. We believe that such in-store presentations provide convenient, one-stop solutions to customers, and thus incentivize clients to purchase an entire room of furniture from us instead of shopping for individual pieces offered by different brands or manufacturers. Our products are mainly designed by our own designers and we also used independent designers in the past for product design. Customer orders are filled by third party manufacturers under our direct quality control. We believe that our products feature superior materials, attractive appearances, superb functionalities and satisfying price points generally desired by today’s middle to upper middle-income consumers worldwide.

International Markets
 
We have been selling products to the U.S., Canadian, Honduras, Panama, Kazakhstan, New Zealand and Middle Eastern markets under the Diamond Sofa brand and selling our Jade Mats to the Malaysia through Nova Malaysia. We believe that discretionary purchases of furniture by middle to upper middle-income consumers will continue to increase in the furniture markets worldwide. We also believe that furniture products that feature contemporary design styles such as ours will continue to attract significant customer demand.
 
In 2021, our products were sold in 9 countries worldwide, with North America and Asia our principal international markets. Sales to North America accounted for 95.9% and 95.6% of sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to other regions, primarily in other Asian countries, accounted for 4.1% and 4.4% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, via our subsidiary, Nova Malaysia, we marketed and sold high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia. As we continue to broaden our distribution network, increase direct sales and grow in the emerging markets, we believe that we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions that will allow us to take advantage of any upturns in the global and local economies of the markets that we serve. That said, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect the economies of each of the countries in which we market our products, which has adversely affected our ability to generate revenues in 2021. In addition, our ability to market our products in 2021 had been adversely impacted by government imposed quarantines and closures, supply chain and shipping disruptions and our current inability to make sales calls and to attend furniture shows.
 
Our expansion in Malaysia with health line products has also been disrupted due to COVID-19. Our initial plan was to establish showrooms in which consumers can interact with our products. Through research, we found that consumers were becoming more self-aware about their health and were willing to improve their lifestyles. Our showrooms were stocked and ready for local consumers to visit, however, due to government regulations these operations have been suspended until quarantines and travel restrictions are lifted. In October 2021, the Order was lifted for people who are fully vaccinated and our store has reopened since. In April 2022, Malaysia has reopened the border for foreign visitors. We also started the online sales of our jade mats products in Malaysia since 2021.


Our global logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections to address their respective needs. We design and supply our products under our own brands. We also design and ship products for other major brands as their OEM designer or supplier. We offer a wide selection of stand-alone furniture pieces across a variety of product categories and approximately over 220 products developed exclusively for the international markets. We also sell products under the Diamond Sofa brand to distributors and retailers in North America, South America and Middle East and to end-user U.S. consumers our own online orders or through third-party shopping portals. Reflecting market demand, our research and development team works closely with customers to timely modify our existing product designs. We also offer custom-designed styles for specific market segments. Once the COVID-19 outbreak dissipates, we plan to grow both online and offline sales.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategies target middle and up-middle class, urban consumers, including: (1) direct sales to the U.S. and international customers; (2) internet sales and online marketing campaigns; and (3) participation in exhibitions and trade shows.
 
We diversify our customer base by increasing direct sales to a broad range of retailers and chain stores across the U.S. and international markets. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales and marketing efforts in North America, and in particular the U.S., which historically is the largest market worldwide for imported furniture. We intend to expand the “Diamond Sofa” brand and introduce new brands for direct sales in the U.S. and international markets while continuing to offer custom-made products under private label.
 
Diamond Bar also currently sells products under the Diamond Sofa brand in the U.S. through third party shopping portals, shipping orders received online directly to the end customer. We believe that our planned direct-to-consumer online sales and marketing strategies will increase our sales in the U.S. by building our brand awareness and acting as an effective advertising vehicle. We also support new product collections and brand launches with print and online advertising campaigns, participation in furniture exhibitions and by offering product brochures and samples. We provide samples and brochures of new products for international markets to distributors and buyers, as is common in the furniture industry.

We used to gain new customers by attending many international furniture trade shows throughout the years. During these events, we introduce new product offerings and launch new design collections. We believe this marketing process helps us to develop and detect the latest-trends in the marketplace, allowing us to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing distributors and buyers with whom we have long–standing customer relationships. We usually present new products at the International Famous Furniture Fair (3F) in Dongguan, China and the China International Furniture Exhibition in Shanghai, China, which were suspended in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. We also exhibit new products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand during the Las Vegas Market (U.S.) and the High Point Market (U.S.) trade shows, which were suspended in 2020 due to COVID-19 but were resumed in 2021. Internationally, we participate in trade fairs in collaboration with our customers. We plan to expand our business in the Middle East by attending several furniture exhibitions in those markets, such as trade show in Dubai. To highlight our latest design collections, we maintain year-round showrooms at the Company’s headquarters in California as well as the High Point Market and Las Vegas Market.
 
In 2021, via our new subsidiary Nova Malaysia, we have marketed and sold high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats to individuals and business companies in Malaysia.
 
Suppliers and Manufacturers
 
We source finished goods from third-party manufacturers to fulfill orders placed by customers through Nova HK and Diamond Bar for the U.S. and international markets. Our three principal suppliers of finished goods in 2021 accounted for approximately 60% of our total purchases for our continuing operations in 2021. By maintaining relationships with multiple suppliers, generally we benefit from a more stable supply chain and better pricing. Under ordinary circumstances, if a change of suppliers is necessary, we believe that we can quickly fulfill our requirements from other suppliers without interruptions in order fulfillment. We monitor our suppliers’ ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce our high-quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter durations. We issue production orders to manufacturers based on individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure products from other sources at our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for sourcing raw materials, agreeing to produce parts and finished products to our specifications. We hold our suppliers to high quality standards and delivery deadlines. Our quality control procedures may extend to stringent requirements for raw material suppliers.
 
The third party contract manufacturers that we utilize in China were closed from the beginning of the Lunar New Year Holiday at the end of January 2020 through the beginning of March 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and recommenced production and shipment in early March 2020. Starting in 2020, certain of the Company’s new products are being sourced from manufacturers in India. The factories in India suspended their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during March through early May 2020. Currently, the factories in China and India are in their normal operations. Shipping of products from Asia has experienced significant delays since the onset of the pandemic and the costs of shipping from Asia have increased due to the pandemic, supply chain disruption and port congestion; and we may continue to experience shipping disruptions in the future. The Company expects that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there will be significant disruptions in the production and shipment of product from those manufacturers, and it is possible that our overseas’ based manufacturers may experience future suspensions of operations as a result of the resurgence or new variants of COVID-19. The situation remains highly uncertain. It is therefore difficult for the Company to estimate the negative impact on our ability to deliver products during the remainder of 2022.
 
Customers
 
Our target end customer is the middle and upper middle-income consumer of residential and commercial furniture. In the U.S. and international markets, our sales principally are to furniture distributors and retailers who in turn offer our products under their own brands or under our Diamond Sofa brand. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020. Once the COVID-19 pandemic dissipates we plan to increase direct sales to retailers and chain stores worldwide as we continue to diversify our customer base from global furniture distributors.

We are focusing on establishing and growing long-term relationships with our customers. We believe that the majority of our customers view us as a strategic long-term supplier and value the quality of our products, our timely delivery and design capabilities. We generally negotiate renewable supplier agreements with firm pricing on our products, typically for a term of one year, as is customary in the furniture industry, with individual orders made on standard purchase orders. In 2021, we sold products into approximately 9 countries worldwide, with North America and Asia as our principal international markets, while we expanded our sales in other regions. Sales to North America accounted for 95.9% and 95.6% of sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change was attributed principally to our changing sales and marketing strategy to seek sales of products with higher margins. Sales to other regions, primarily in other Asia countries, accounted for 4.1% and 4.4% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to come from our sales to the U.S. and international markets. Diamond Bar accounted for 98.0% and 95.9% of total sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively, Nova Macao’s revenues accounted for 0% and 4.1% of total sales from our continuing operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and Nova HK revenues accounted for 2.0% of total sales from our continuing operations in 2021. All of Nova HK’s revenue was generated from the sale by Nova Malaysia of the Jade Matts supplied by Nova HK. Effective February 15, 2022, all of such Jade Matts inventory are owned by Nova Malaysia. In addition, we anticipate increasing internet sales under the Diamond Sofa brand through third-party shopping portals and through Nova Malaysia’s website. We believe that as we expand our broad network of distributors and increase direct sales, we will be better positioned to capitalize on emerging market trends.
 
We typically experience stronger fourth calendar quarters as our product sales are subject to the seasonality and fluctuations typical of the furniture industry. However, due to the shipping backlog, our fourth quarter’s sales were worse than the first two quarters in 2021. This industry-based seasonality is generally caused by shipping lead-times to international markets combined with the real estate market slowdown and decrease in furniture consumption commonly experienced during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere markets in which the majority of our customers are located and our products sell at retail. In addition, we believe that consumer demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including, but not limited to, unemployment rates, housing market conditions and consumer confidence. In view of the expected adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the respective economies of those countries in which we sell our products, and the COVID-19 pandemic-related impact on our supply chains and shipping providers, seasonality and period to period fluctuations in product sales are impossible to predict in 2022.
 
Competition
 
The furniture industry is large and highly competitive. The industry consists of many manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. Our products principally compete in the U.S., Canada, Honduras, Panama, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Malaysia and Middle Eastern markets. The primary competitive factors in these markets for our products and target consumers are price, quality, style, marketing, functionality and availability.
 
In the U.S. and international markets, we compete against other furniture distributors and wholesalers which are mostly located in China and other Southeast Asian countries. We also compete against traditional distributors in North America and Europe. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages over North American and European distributors due to our superb customer service and a history of prompt delivery of high quality products. Our contemporary product designs have styles and functionality that are better than, or at least comparable to, those offered by our higher-priced competitors. Our design team closely coordinates with our sales and marketing staff to include customer feedback as part of their ongoing R&D improvement process, thus allows the Company to develop and timely modify products to meet the changing stylistic and functional demands from our worldwide customers. We believe that our decades of product experience and proven performance record offer competitive edges over many other suppliers. In addition to our design and logistical capabilities, we believe that our experience from sourcing custom-made products for distributors presents significant benefits to our customers.
 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters. We believe the Company has complied with the relevant federal, state, local and international requirements for environmental protection.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on the trademark protection laws in the U.S. to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. The Company and our subsidiaries currently hold two trademarks registered in the U.S. related to the “Diamond Sofa” brand. In addition, we have registered and maintained numerous internet domain names related to our business, including “novalifestyle.com”, “novaliving.com.my” and “diamondsofa.com.”
Research and Development
 
We believe that new product designs are important to our continued success. We actively seek to protect our product designs and brand names under the trademark protection laws in the U.S., but the copying of a product’s appearance is a common and ongoing issue in the furniture industry as manufacturers seek to capitalize on popular designs and features by copying those of their competitors and making subtle changes to avoid infringement claims. To remain competitive, we believe that we must constantly innovate to stay ahead of competitors. We have developed a design process that enables us to better manage the short product life cycles for furniture designs by anticipating and responding quickly to changing consumer preferences. Ordinarily, we strive to attend furniture exhibitions worldwide, conduct market research and solicit customer feedback to help us identify new trends and customer needs in our target markets. We then incorporate customer feedback into new product designs. We normally introduce new product collections annually for the U.S. and international markets. We anticipate introducing new products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand on a quarterly basis for the U.S. market. At least annually, we assess the marketing results for new designs in order to decide whether to continue with a particular line.
 
We use in-house designers and computer-aided modeling systems to generate design and related development work. We have used independent designers in the past for product design, from which we built prototype furniture pieces for refinement and testing. In 2021 and 2020, we invested $110,287 and $33,746, respectively, on research and development expense. We may increase future investments in R&D based on our growth needs.
 
Furniture Industry Regulations and Standards

We and our products are subject to PRC, U.S. and international regulations related to the furniture industry.
 
China has a series of national standards, or the GB and QB standards, that govern certain technical, safety and quality requirements for furniture manufactured in and exported from China. The Standardization Administration of the PRC, or SAC, and the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light Industrial Products and Art-Crafts, or the CCCLA, develop and revise these national standards relating to the structure, material, size and quality requirements for the many varied categories and classifications of upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture. Many of these standards are not compulsory, but manufacturers typically follow all applicable recommended standards.
 
Our products are also subject to the mandatory and voluntary furniture test standards of the U.S. and international markets in which our products are distributed to end consumers, including those developed by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association, or BIFMA, ASTM International, California Air Resources Board, or CARB, Furniture Industry Research Association, or FIRA, and the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. These environmental, ecological and formaldehyde emission standards and source of origin labeling requirements are national or international, with the U.S. and European Union typically having the strictest standards for their markets. We source products from third party manufacturers and we rely on them to meet all local manufacturing standards.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 29 full time employees worldwide. Our U.S. corporate office and operations employed 25 full-time employees, our location in Malaysia and Hong Kong employed 3 and 1 a total of 4 full-time employees, respectively. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
