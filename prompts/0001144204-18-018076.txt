ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SSC) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. Since 2010, it has been a premium content Video On Demand (“VOD”) services provider with primary operations in the People’s Republic of China through its subsidiaries and variable interest entities since 2010. It provided premium content and integrated value-added service solutions for the delivery of VOD and paid video programming to digital cable providers, Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) providers, Over-the-Top (“OTT”) streaming providers, mobile manufacturers and operators, as well as direct customers.
 
Starting from 2017, it is aiming to become a next generation Artificial-Intelligent (AI) & Blockchain-Powered, Fintech company. By managing and providing an infrastructure and environment that facilitates the transformation of traditional financial markets such as commodities, currency and credit into the asset digitalization era, SSC hopes to provide asset owners and holders a seamless method and platform for digital asset securitization, tokenization and trading. Separately, SSC is aiming to offer a closed supply chain trading ecosystem for corporate buyers and sellers designed to eliminate standard transactional intermediaries and create a more direct and margin-expanding path for principals.
 
Currently the Company is trying to establish a business ecosystem based on a “7-3-2-1” structural approach:
 
Seven (“7”) Product Engines:
 a. Big commodity markets;
 b. Currency markets;
 c. Credit markets;
 d. Fractal securitization of all third party securitization products;
 e. Asset backed tokenization and other real physical asset backed securitization issuance and trading through the Initial Exchange Offering (“IEO”) network;
 f. Blockchain-based securitization of private equity backed companies;
 g. Supply chain finance and management for vertical products.
 
Grouped into Three ("3") Blockchain-Based Technology Platforms:
 a. "Plutus": Powering Product Engines 1-3;
 b. "Apollo": Powering Product Engines 4-6;
 c. "Venus": Powering Product Engine 7.
 
Which are Distributed via Two ("2") Networks:
 a. NextGen X IEO ("Initial Exchange Offering"): A global digital securitization offering & issuance network of exchange and Alternative Trading Services (ATS);
 b. Vertical Product Industry Exchange.
 
All of Which Combined Create One ("1”) Multi-Faceted Value Hub providing the Following Functionality:
 a. Asset Valuation, Rating & Pricing
 b. I-Banking
 c. Settlement
 d. Others
 
2017 has been a year of transition from the Company’s legacy business to the Company’s new business.
 
In early December 2016, in order to offset losses from a high upfront minimum guarantee licensing fees to studios, the Company announced a change to its business model with the Yanhua Operating Partnership, where Yanhua will act as the exclusive distribution operator (within the territory of the People's Republic of China) of the Company's licensed library of major studio films. The Yanhua Partnership modified and improved the Company's legacy major studio paid content business model by moving from a framework that included high and fixed cost upfront minimum guarantee payments, rising content costs from major Hollywood studios and low margins to a structure that will now include relatively nominal costs to the Company, upfront minimum guarantee payments to the Company and the opportunity to reach an even wider audience. With this partnership, Yanhua assumed all sales and marketing costs and will pay the Company a minimum guarantee in exchange for a percentage of the total revenue share. This completely transformed the legacy business by mitigating or removing the possibility of continuing to operate at a loss yet still providing the Company with the opportunity to benefit from revenue upside based on the Yanhua Partnership's success.
 
SSC still runs its legacy YOD business with limited resources. SSC launched its legacy VOD service through the acquisition of YOD Hong Kong (formerly Sinotop Group Limited) on July 30, 2010, through its subsidiary China CB Cayman. Through a series of contractual arrangements, YOD WFOE, the subsidiary of YOD Hong Kong, controls Sinotop Beijing, a corporation established in the PRC. Sinotop Beijing was the 80% owner of Zhong Hai Media until June 30, 2017, through which we provided: 1) integrated value–added business–to–business (“B2B”) service solutions for the delivery of VOD and enhanced premium content for digital cable; 2) integrated value–added business–to–business–to–customer (“B2B2C”) service solutions for the delivery of VOD and enhanced premium content for IPTV and OTT providers and; 3) a direct to user, or B2C, mobile video service app. The disposal of Zhong Hai Media is further described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
 
Pertaining to the Company’s efforts to become a next generation Artificial-Intelligent (AI) & Blockchain-Powered, Fintech company, in early Q1 2017, the Company completed a related-party transaction for the acquisition of Sun Video Group HK Limited ("SVG"), which has a 51% ownership stake in M.Y. Products, LLC ("MYP"), a global, smart supply chain management operator. Functioning as a global smart supply chain management company, the acquisition was consummated in an effort to support the Company's brand licensing and video commerce business with B2B services. With the aforementioned service offerings under one roof, the Company could now provide Chinese manufacturers the opportunity to improve profitability within the distribution chain and allowing manufacturers to capture more robust margins as well as reapportioning cost savings to marketing and branding, thereby improving revenue volume.
 
Also in early February 2017, the Company announced it had acquired 55% of Wide Angle Group Limited ("WAG"). The Company acquired 55% of the outstanding capital shares in WAG from the seller, BT Capital Global Limited. Coupling WAG's capabilities and offerings with those already existing under the SVG/MYP deal, including Supply Chain Management, Manufacturer Sourcing, Supply Chain Financing, VR (virtual reality)-Enabled Commerce Technology and AI-driven Big Data Technology Management, the Company was seeking to creating a diversified and robust business division, separate from the VOD business. 
 
For 2017, through the acquisition and operation of the SVG and WAG, engine seven was operational. There are two revenue sources for engine seven “Supply Chain Finance and Management for Vertical Products”. They are supply chain management & structured finance and alternative finance & carry trade businesses. The Company is currently primarily engaged with consumer electronics and smart supply chain management operations. Our end customers include about 15 to 20 corporations across the world. Starting from October, through partnership with another business partner, our newly controlled Singapore joint venture has been conducting oil trading business in Singapore. Other than the trading business that Company already operated in 2017, the Company also intends to run the engine upon its Venus blockchain based platform, which includes TPaaS & VPaaS system. As of fourth quarter of 2017, TPaaS system went into trial operation.

VIE Structure and Arrangements

To comply with PRC laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunication services, we provide services through Sinotop Beijing and SSF, which hold the licenses and approvals to provide digital distribution and Internet content services in the PRC. We have the ability to control Sinotop Beijing and SSF through a series of contractual agreements, as described below, entered into among YOD WFOE, YOD Hong Kong, Sinotop Beijing, SSF and the respective legal shareholders of Sinotop Beijing and SSF.
 
Through these contractual arrangements, we have acquired both control over and rights to, 100% of the economic benefit of Sinotop Beijing and SSF. Accordingly, Sinotop Beijing and SSF are each considered a variable interest entity, or VIE, and are therefore consolidated in our financial statements. Pursuant to the below contractual agreements, YOD WFOE can have the assets transferred freely out of each VIE without any restrictions. Therefore, YOD WFOE considers that there is no asset of the respective VIE that can be used only to settle obligation of such VIE, except for the registered capital of each respective VIE, amounting to RMB10.6 million (or approximately $1.6 million) for Sinotop Beijing as of December 31, 2017, and RMB 27.6 million (or approximately $4.2 million) has been injected as of December 31, 2017. As Sinotop Beijing and SSF are incorporated as limited liability companies under PRC Company Law, creditors of these two entities do not have recourse to the general credit of other entities of the Company.

Our Industry (For the Supply Chain Finance & Management Businesses)

As discussed in the Overview above, our business ecosystem is based on seven product engines, and plan to launch respective product engines in full as high priorities by the management. For 2017, only engine seven was operational. There are two revenue sources for engine seven “Supply Chain Finance and Management for Vertical Products”. They are supply chain management & structured finance and alternative finance & carry trade businesses. We intend to run the engine upon its Venus blockchain based platform, which includes TPaaS & VPaaS system. As of fourth quarter of 2017, TPaaS system went into trial operation. In 2018, we intend to strengthen our engine seven operation by including among other things i) Venus platform fully operational, and ii) establishing blockchain based supply chain finance model.
Supply Chain Management & Structured Finance
 
The growth rate of supply chain finance volume in developed countries is 10%-30% in 2011, while the growth rate of that in emerging economies in China and India is 20%-25%. Financing for small and medium-sized enterprises has always been difficult around the globe, especially during expanded reproduction period. As most small and medium-sized corporate issuers are not qualified to issue under regular asset backed securities and asset backed notes products on national credit market, innovative structured financing tools such as asset-backed specific plan scheme plays a key role as complementary financing tools in helping those firms to meet their potential financing needs. Also according to “2015-2020 China’s supply chain finance market forward-looking research report published by “Zhiyan Consulting”, it forecasts that China's supply chain finance market size will reach 15 trillion by 2020.
Alternative Finance & Carry Trade
 
Growth in global alternative finance market is accelerating and China is still dominating. By 2015, global market reached 918 billion RMB while China market reached 673.5 billion RMB. By the end of 2016, China market increased from about 673.5 billion RMB in 2015 to 1,603 billion RMB in 2016, accounting for 99.2% of the total Asian financial market, and an estimated 85% of the total global market in 2016.1
 
China is currently dominated by non-business alternative finance, which totaled 928 billion RMB in 2016 led by peer-to-peer consumer lending. However, it is likely that a sizable proportion of consumers in China are using personal loans for business purposes. Of which, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly turning to alternative sources of financing. In China, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 99% of registered companies, are the most active forces in China and they are playing an important role in promoting economy, increasing taxation revenue and stabilizing employment rate. However, only 10% of SMEs are able to get financing from banks, and over 80% are relying on alternative financing sources, especially in the commodities trade market. 2
 
From Carry Trade’s perspective, the RMB exchange rate is close to the highest level since October 2017, the expected volatility is near the lowest level in two consecutive years, and the interest rate is relatively high because of government’s deleveraging measures. Chinese currency has become Asia’s the most attractive carry trade over the same period of time.3

Our Competition (For the Supply Chain Finance & Management Businesses)
 
In recent years, the market for supply chain finance business is faced with increasingly aggressive competitions. Our primary competitors are mainly from supply chain finance solutions providers in the B2B Supply Chain marketplace. Specifically, in terms of the commodities global trade market, Longfin Corp. (NASDAQ: LFIN), a USA based company which is engaged in import/export finance through buying/selling commodity flows from global companies, financing for lower credit rated SME and asset liability management funding for bank treasuries using commodity trade flows, is our primary competitor. SSC is aiming to strengthen competitiveness in utilizing dynamic ontology based methodology and Fintech powered risk management tools to rate and evaluate risks inherent in those borrowers distinguishes us from Longfin Corp.

Our employees are not represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
 
We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of employee salary. In addition, we are required by the PRC law to cover employees in China with various types of social insurance. We believe that we are in compliance with the relevant PRC laws.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operating results and operating cash flows historically for our legacy YOD business have not been subject to seasonal variations. However, we expect a disproportionate amount of our revenues generated from Wecast Services quarter over quarter to be subject to seasoned fluctuations at holiday periods and due to introduction of new products. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions.
Regulation
 
General Regulation of Businesses
 
We are required to obtain government approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”), and other government agencies in China for transactions such as our acquisition or disposition of business entities in China. Additionally, foreign ownership of business and assets in China is not permitted without specific government approval. For this reason, Sinotop Beijing was acquired through our acquisition of YOD Hong Kong, which controls Sinotop Beijing through a series of contractual agreements with YOD Hong Kong and YOD WFOE. We use voting control agreements among the parties so as to obtain equitable and legal ownership or control of our subsidiaries and VIEs to conduct our legacy YOD business.

Investment activities in China by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Catalogue sets forth the industries in which foreign investments are "encouraged", "restricted", or "prohibited". Industries that are not listed in any of the above three categories are permitted areas for foreign investments, and are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.
 
According to the latest version of the Catalogue, which came into effect on July 28, 2017, foreign investments in value-added telecommunications services (except for e-commerce) are "restricted". Therefore, we provide value-added telecommunications services through our VIE in China.
 
Other than value-added telecommunications, most of our PRC subsidiaries mainly engage in technical services, consultations and trading activities, which are "encouraged" under the latest version of the Catalogue.
 
Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is subject to the approval of or filing with the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign-owned enterprise must register with the competent industry and commerce bureau. Our significant PRC subsidiaries have duly obtained all material approvals required for their business operations.
 
Foreign direct investment in telecommunications companies in China is governed by the Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises, which was promulgated by the State Council on December 11, 2001 and recently amended on February 6, 2016. The regulations provide that a foreign investor's beneficial equity ownership in an entity providing value-added telecommunications services in China is not permitted to exceed 50%. In addition, the main foreign investor who invests in a foreign-invested value-added telecommunications enterprise operating the value-added telecommunications business in China must demonstrate a good track record and experience in operating a value-added telecommunications business, provided such investor is a major one among the foreign investors investing in a value-added telecommunications enterprise in China. Moreover, foreign investors that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, and the MOFCOM, or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals, for its commencement of value-added telecommunications business in China.
 
The MIIT's Notice Regarding Strengthening Administration of Foreign Investment in Operating Value-Added Telecommunication Businesses, or the MIIT Notice, issued on July 13, 2006 prohibits holders of these services licenses from leasing, transferring or selling their licenses in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities, to any foreign investors intending to conduct such businesses in China.
 
The PRC market in which the we operate our legacy YOD business poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of us to conduct wireless telecommunication services through contractual arrangements in the PRC since the industry remains highly regulated. We conduct those operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered among YOD WFOE, Sinotop Beijing as the parent company of Zhong Hai Media, SSF and the respective legal shareholders of Sinotop Beijing and SSF. We believe that these contractual arrangements are in compliance with PRC law and are legally enforceable. If Sinotop Beijing, SSF or their respective legal shareholders fail to perform the obligations under the contractual arrangements or any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, YOD WFOE or YOD HK can enforce its rights under the VIE contracts through PRC law and courts. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the Company’s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties. If YOD WFOE had direct ownership of Sinotop Beijing and SSF, it would be able to exercise its rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of Sinotop Beijing or SSF, which in turn could effect changes at the management level, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations. However, under the current contractual arrangements, the Company relies on Sinotop Beijing, SSF and their respective legal shareholders to perform their contractual obligations to exercise effective control. The Company also gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in deconsolidation of the VIEs.

In addition, the telecommunications, information and media industries remain highly regulated. Restrictions are currently in place and are unclear with respect to which segments of these industries foreign owned entities, like YOD WFOE, may operate. The PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on existing laws to regulate areas such as telecommunications, information and media, some of which are not published on a timely basis or may have retroactive effect. For example, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the Draft Foreign Investment Law, including, among others, what the actual content of the law will be as well as the adoption and effective date of the final form of the law. Administrative and court proceedings in China may also be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. While such uncertainty exists, we cannot assure that the new laws, when it is adopted and becomes effective, and potential related administrative proceedings will not have a material and adverse effect on our ability to control the affiliated entities through the contractual arrangements. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current tax laws, and our legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on our ability to conduct business in the PRC.

Taxation
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of China passed the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules which took effect on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified earned income tax (“EIT”) rate of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and foreign invested enterprises (“FIEs”) unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. In addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as “an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.” If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our organization’s global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - Under the New Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China.” Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.”
 
On December 22, 2017 the U.S. Tax Reform, which among other effects, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 34% (or 35% in certain cases) beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that is payable over eight years, makes the receipt of future non-U.S. sourced income of non-U.S. subsidiaries tax-free to U.S. companies and creates a new minimum tax on the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries relating to the parent’s deductions for payments to the subsidiaries. U.S. Tax Reform, also eliminates the expiration date for U.S. net operating loss carryovers (NOLs”). Such carryovers may now be carried forward indefinitely rather than for 20 years. In addition, NOLs can only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any single year.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Approximately 50% of our gross profit and most expenses are denominated in RMB. Under the PRC foreign currency exchange regulations applicable to us, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Currently, our PRC operating entities may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), by complying with certain procedural requirements. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating entities borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the MOFCOM, or their respective local branches. These limitations could affect our PRC operating entities’ ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.
Dividend Distributions
 
Approximately 50% of our gross profit are earned by our PRC entities. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC entities to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC entities only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiaries have the discretion to allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
 
In addition, under the new EIT law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates (“Notice 112”), which was issued on January 29, 2008, and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding Interpretation and Recognition of Beneficial Owners under Tax Treaties (“Notice 601”), which became effective on October 27, 2009, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our entities will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Furthermore, the ultimate tax rate will be determined by treaty between the PRC and the tax residence of the holder of the PRC subsidiary. Dividends declared and paid from before January 1, 2008 on distributable profits are grandfathered under the EIT Law and are not subject to withholding tax.
 
The Company intends on reinvesting profits, if any, and does not intend on making cash distributions of dividends in the near future.
