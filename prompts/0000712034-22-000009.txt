ITEM 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the terms "ACCO Brands," "ACCO," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ACCO Brands Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2005, and its consolidated domestic and international subsidiaries. 
For a description of certain factors that may have had, or may in the future have, a significant impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this report.
Overview of the Company
ACCO Brands designs, markets, and manufactures well-recognized consumer, school, technology and office products. Our widely known brands include AT-A-GLANCE®, Barrilito®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, Foroni®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, PowerA®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, and TruSens®. Approximately 70 percent of our sales come from brands that occupy the No. 1 or No. 2 position in the product categories in which we compete. Our top 12 brands represented $1.5 billion of our 2021 net sales. We distribute our products through a wide variety of channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers; e-tailers; discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; wholesalers; contract stationers; technology specialty businesses; and our direct-to-consumer channel. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. 
We have transformed our business by investing in innovative branded consumer and technology products for use in businesses, schools, and homes, both organically and through acquisitions. This change should enable us to continue to organically grow sales and increase profitability by focusing our selling efforts on growing channels, as well as strategically managing declining customers and commoditized product categories, which remain important profit and cash generators. Our top five customers represented 36 percent of our sales in 2021.
Our business is consumer- and brand-centric, product differentiated, and geographically diverse. Organically, we have grown our PowerA® video gaming accessories, Kensington® computer accessories and Leitz® and Rexel® European range of shredders and organization product offerings. ACCO Brands remains a leading supplier of school products, including our top-selling Five Star® line of school notebooks in North America, laminating machines, and stapling and punching products, among others. We have also entered the wellness category with TruSens® branded air purifiers, which we plan to expand over the next few years.
We have made five major acquisitions over the past six years. These acquisitions have meaningfully expanded our portfolio of well-known brands, enhanced our competitive position from both a product and channel perspective, and added scale to our operations. Historically, our approach to acquisitions has focused on consolidation and geographic expansion opportunities that met our strategic and financial criteria. Strategically, we have targeted categories or geographies that provided opportunities for growth, leading brands, and channel diversity. More recently we have prioritized growing product categories, including adjacencies.
Our recent acquisition of PowerA in late 2020 allowed us to enter an attractive product category of third-party video gaming accessories, including controllers, power charging stations, and headsets. The addition of PowerA, has meaningfully improved ACCO Brands' potential for organic sales growth and profitability and reinforced our presence in the faster growing mass and e-commerce channels. PowerA sales grew 22 percent in 2021 as compared to its 2020 pro forma annual sales, and is expected to continue to provide double-digit sales growth for the next several years. The Company plans to expand this business internationally, particularly in Europe and Asia, adding to organic growth over the longer term. PowerA® and Kensington® are now our two largest and fastest growing brands, representing approximately 25 percent of our sales. 

 In all of our segments, we see opportunities for sales growth through share gains, channel expansion, and product enhancements. Our leading product category positions provide the scale to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive profitable growth. We expect to grow in mature markets in the gaming, technology, and branded school and office categories. We also anticipate continuing recovery in areas depressed from COVID-19.
We generate strong operating cash flow and will continue to leverage our cost structure through acquisitions, synergies and productivity savings to drive long-term profit and operating cash flow improvement.

Operating Segments
ACCO Brands has three operating business segments based in different geographic regions: North America, EMEA, and International. Each business segment designs, markets, sources, manufactures, and sells recognized consumer, technology and other end-user demanded branded products used in businesses, schools, and homes. Product designs are tailored to end-user preferences in each geographic region, and where possible, leverage common engineering, design, and sourcing.
Our product categories include gaming and computer accessories; storage and organization; notebooks; shredding; laminating and binding machines; stapling; punching; calendars; dry erase boards; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. Our portfolio includes both globally and regionally recognized brands. 

Operating Segment | Geography | Primary Brands | Primary Products 
ACCO Brands North America | United States and Canada | PowerA®, Five Star®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Quartet®, Kensington®, Swingline®, GBC®, Mead®, Hilroy® | Computer and gaming accessories, school products, planners, storage and organization, dry erase boards and accessories, laminating, stapling and punching products. 
ACCO Brands EMEA | Europe, Middle East and Africa | Leitz®, Rapid®, Kensington®, Esselte®, Rexel®, PowerA®, GBC®, NOBO®, Derwent® | Storage and organization products (lever-arch binders, sheet protectors, indexes), computer and gaming accessories, stapling, punching, shredding, laminating, do-it-yourself tools, dry erase boards and writing and art products 
ACCO Brands International | Australia/N.Z., Latin America and Asia-Pacific | Tilibra®, GBC®, Kensington®, Marbig®, Foroni®, Barrilito®, Artline®*, PowerA®, Spirax® *Australia/N.Z. only | School notebooks, storage and organization products (binders, sheet protectors and indexes), computer and gaming accessories, laminating, shredding, writing and arts products, janitorial supplies, dry erase boards and stapling and punching products


Sales Percentage by Operating Segment | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
ACCO Brands North America | 51 | % | | 50 | % | 49 | %
ACCO Brands EMEA | 33 | | | 32 | | 29 | 
ACCO Brands International | 16 | | | 18 | | 22 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Seasonality
Although we experienced a more normal seasonality in 2021, ongoing disruption from the pandemic, particularly in our International segment, negatively impacted demand due to continuing school and office closures. Historically, each of our segments has demand that varies based on certain seasonal drivers. For North America, the important seasonal selling periods are related to back-to-school and calendar year end. The North America back-to-school season mainly occurs in the second and third quarters, with the third quarter also seeing stronger sales of gaming and technology products. The calendar year end drives significant sales of gaming, technology and dated products. The EMEA segment experiences much less seasonality than the other segments, but the first and fourth quarters are typically stronger, with the second and third impacted by lower demand due to summer vacations. The International segment historically has strong back-to-school sales in the fourth quarter and into January as Brazil and Australia are in the Southern hemisphere. However, in 2021 we continued to experience very low demand for school products in Brazil as many schools were largely closed due to the pandemic. Mexico, where back-to-school historically straddles the second and third quarters, also continued to experience low demand during 2021 also due to ongoing school and office closures.
As a result of the seasonal nature of the demand for our products, we expect to continue to generate a significant percentage of our sales and profit during the second, third, and fourth quarters, although the amounts generated in each of these quarters may vary due to changing customer behaviors. However, all of our operating cash flow is generated in the second half of the year, as the cash inflows in the first quarter are consumed building working capital. Our third and fourth quarter cash flow comes from completing the working capital cycle.
For further information on the seasonality of net sales, earnings and cash flow, see "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Customers
We distribute our products through a wide variety of channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains, warehouse clubs, hardware and specialty stores, independent office product dealers, office superstores, wholesalers, contract stationers, and specialist technology businesses. We also sell directly through e-commerce sites and our direct sales organization. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top ten customers accounted for 45 percent of net sales. Walmart and Amazon were our top two customers and each represented approximately 9 percent of our sales in 2021.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by large, sophisticated customers, and competition from a wide range of products and services. For certain of our products, there are low barriers to entry. ACCO Brands competes with numerous branded consumer products manufacturers, as well as many private label suppliers and importers, including various customers who import their own private label products directly from foreign sources. Examples of branded competitors include Bi-Silque, Blue Sky, Corsair, Dominion Blueline, Fellowes, Hamelin, Herlitz, Logitech, LSC Communications, Newell Brands, Novus, PDP, Razer, Stanley Black and Decker, SteelSeries, and Targus, among others.
The Company meets competitive challenges by creating and maintaining leading brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value, performance, and benefits to consumers. Our products are sold to consumers and end-users through diverse distribution channels that require superior customer service. We further meet consumer needs by developing, producing, and procuring products at a competitive cost, enabling them to be sold at attractive selling prices. We also believe that our experience and skill in managing complex assortments and large seasonal demand is a competitive advantage, as is our strong relationships with technology providers in our computer and video gaming accessories businesses.
Product Development
Our strong commitment to understanding consumers and designing products that fulfill their needs drives our product development strategy, which we believe will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Our products are developed by our internal research and development teams or through partnership initiatives with inventors, vendors and technology providers. Costs related to product development when paid directly by ACCO Brands are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
We seek opportunities to invest in new products and adjacencies. Our innovation efforts focus on generating new, exciting and differentiated consumer-oriented products that meet consumer and end-user needs and provide the opportunity for meaningful growth. The criteria we use in assessing strategic fit or investment opportunities include: the ability to create strong, differentiated products and brands; the importance of the product category to key customers and consumers; the relationship with existing product lines; the importance to the market; and the actual and potential impact on our sales and operating performance.
Marketing and Demand Generation
We support our brands with a significant investment in targeted marketing and advertising, including catalogs, digital and social media, and consumer promotions that increase brand awareness, drive conversion, and highlight the innovation and differentiation of our products. We work with third-party vendors, such as Nielsen, NPD Group, GfK SE, and Kantar Group, to capture and analyze consumer buying habits and product trends. We also use our deep consumer knowledge to develop effective marketing, advertising, and merchandising programs and strategies.
Supply
Our products are either manufactured or sourced to ensure that we supply our customers with quality products, innovative solutions, attractive pricing, and convenient customer service. We have built a customer-focused business model with a flexible supply chain to ensure that these factors are appropriately balanced. Using a combination of our own manufacturing and third-party sourcing enables us to reduce costs and effectively manage our production assets by lowering capital investment and working capital requirements. Our overall strategy is to manufacture locally those products that would incur a relatively high freight and/or duty expense or that have high customer service needs. We use third parties to source those products that require more direct labor to produce. We also look for opportunities to leverage our manufacturing facilities to improve operating efficiencies, as well as customer service. We currently manufacture approximately 40 percent of our products where we operate and source the remaining 60 percent from lower cost countries, primarily from in Asia.
Intellectual Property
Our products are marketed under a variety of trademarks. Some of our more significant trademarks include ACCO®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Barrilito®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, Foroni®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, PowerA®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, and Tilibra®. We own rights to these trademarks in various countries throughout the world. We protect these trademarks as appropriate through registrations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also own numerous patents worldwide. Additionally, our PowerA business depends on maintaining our licensing rights with key gaming console manufacturers and video game publishers.
Human Capital Resources
As the Home of Great Brands Built by Great People, we believe our employees are the key ingredient to our success. In alignment with our Vision, Values and Leadership Promise, we strive to create a great place to work and one that attracts top talent and motivates them to stay and contribute to our winning team.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,000 full-time and part-time employees worldwide, with approximately 4,200 employees based outside of the U.S. Approximately 500 employees in our North American business are covered by collective bargaining agreements in certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities. Outside the U.S., we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements in certain countries, particularly in Europe and Brazil. There have been no strikes or material labor disputes at any of our facilities during the past five years.
Diversity and Inclusion
At ACCO Brands, our values include respecting the individual and embracing diversity. We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in improved and more innovative products and services, and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We also believe that our leadership should reflect the diversity of our employees, ACCO Brands’ diversity goals are to increase the percentage of director-level-and-above female leaders to 33 percent by 2025. For the total Company, we made good progress in 2021, moving from our 2019 baseline of 26.6 percent to 29.5 percent.
To continue to drive our diversity goals and build a culture of inclusion, we have established a multi-year roadmap and a governance model which engages leadership at all levels of the organization. We have also developed an enhanced diversity and inclusion dashboard to track our actions and outcomes. Our roadmap is focused on three key priorities: ensuring diverse candidate slates for all director-level-and-above job opportunities, integrating talent development and succession planning, and building manager capability to lead inclusively.
Talent Management and Succession Planning
Building and sustaining strong talent is critical to our success. We know that offering the right mix of on-the-job experiences and learning and development will support our goal of building capable and ready talent to lead the Company. This focus was key to our ability to fill 75 percent of our director level and above open positions in 2021 with internal talent. Additionally, we invest in our employees by building individual and organizational capabilities that provide relevant learning and development solutions closely linked to business strategies. This includes recent programs focused on assessing and building digital marketing capabilities with our outside partners at Econsultancy and an internally developed program designed 
to enhance the financial acumen of our executive leaders. We deliver Company-required learning to ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct and other important policies. We enhance leadership effectiveness by fostering managers who recognize that being effective, inclusive leaders of people is the best way to impact the business and their teams. Our "Raising the Bar" leadership development program supports the Company’s mission to have effective, inclusive leaders at all levels.
Employee Engagement
An important factor in our ability to deliver sustainable, long-term value and optimize resource utilization is our proactive management of employee engagement. We periodically invite employees to give candid feedback about their experiences working for ACCO Brands through an Employee Engagement Survey, the most recent of which occurred in late 2021. We achieved a response rate of 91 percent, which is above the average participation rate of 85 percent as measured by the independent firm used to conduct the survey. The survey results were overall extremely positive showing improvement in 83 percent of the questions that were repeated from the prior survey, with our most favorable responses in the areas of customer focus, organizational agility, company culture, and promising organizational direction. This active engagement of leadership and employees not only drives our workplace culture, it also results in positive business performance.
Employee Health and Safety ("EHS")
We are committed to Mission Zero— pursuing continuous improvement in health and safety within all our locations and to attain our goal of zero accidents and zero incidents. We have implemented our Comprehensive Environmental and Safety Management Plan ("CESMP") as an overall management system for our manufacturing and distribution locations. CESMP audits are completed by our EHS teams to measure the proactive steps each location is taking to prevent injuries. 
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work. Our corporate values include acting responsibly in our global communities through numerous employee volunteer and outreach initiatives. We encourage our employees to make a difference in our Company and in their communities by building on a fundamental commitment to integrity, teamwork, respect and inclusivity. We support a wide range of charities worldwide, the most significant of which is the City of Hope in the U.S, which has been ongoing for many years.
Sustainability/Environment
We continued to make progress on our three Planet, People and Products global sustainability goals relating to energy efficiency, diversity and third-party certification that we announced in 2020 and published in our fourth annual ESG Report in 2021. We strive for greater efficiencies in the procurement, use and disposal of resources and are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We also continue to focus on the initiatives identified in 2019 as most relevant for our business, as expressed by stakeholders, using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Materiality Matrix. These are Energy Management, Data Security, Workforce Diversity and Inclusion, Product Sourcing, Packaging and Marketing, and Labor Conditions in the Supply Chain.
