ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

The Company was founded in 1985 as Fiberstars, Inc., a California corporation, and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2006. In May 2007, Fiberstars, Inc. merged with and became Energy Focus, Inc., also a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 32000 Aurora Road, Suite B, Solon, Ohio 44139. Our telephone number is 440.715.1300. Our website address is www.energyfocus.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report.
Energy Focus, Inc. and its subsidiary engage in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of energy-efficient lighting systems. We operate in a single industry segment, developing and selling our energy-efficient light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting products into the general commercial, industrial and military maritime markets. Our goal is to become a trusted leader in the LED lighting retrofit market by replacing fluorescent lamps in institutional buildings and high-intensity discharge (“HID”) lighting in low-bay and high-bay applications with our innovative, high-quality commercial and military tubular LED (“TLED”) products.

Over the past few years we have exited non-core businesses to focus our efforts on TLED products, starting with the sale of our pool lighting products business in 2013. During 2015 we exited our turnkey solutions business operated by our subsidiary, Energy Focus LED Solutions, LLC (“EFLS”), and exited our United Kingdom business through the sale of Crescent Lighting Limited (“CLL”), our wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result, we have reclassified all net sales and expenses associated with both EFLS and CLL from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and have reported the related net income (loss) as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information on our disposition of these businesses.

Given the decline in our military maritime business, the changing competitive landscape of the U.S. Navy sales channel and the timing uncertainty of commercial sales growth, we implemented a restructuring initiative during the first quarter of 2017. The intent of the restructuring strategy was to maximize operating cost reductions without sacrificing either our new product pipeline or potential long-term revenue growth and return the Company to profitability. On February 19, 2017, the Board appointed Dr. Ted Tewksbury to serve as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President to lead the Company’s restructuring efforts. Dr. Tewksbury, who holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from MIT, is a well-seasoned semiconductor industry executive with experience in implementing and managing successful business restructurings.
The restructuring initiative included an organizational consolidation of management functions in order to streamline and better align the Company into a more focused, efficient, and cost-effective organization. The initiative also included the transition from our historical direct sales model, to an agency driven sales channel strategy in order to expand our market presence throughout the United States (“U.S.”). During 2017 we closed our New York, New York, Arlington, Virginia and Rochester, Minnesota and offices, reduced full-time equivalent headcount by 51 percent and significantly decreased operating expenses from 2016 levels (a net reduction of $8.4 million, which includes $1.8 million in offsetting restructuring and impairment charges). As of December 31, 2017, we had effectively transitioned our sales force to an agency driven sales channel, expanding our sales coverage to the entire U.S. through 6 geographic regions and 30 sales agents. As a result of this transition, we have substantially expanded from a primarily Midwest focus to build market presence and awareness in other regions of the U.S. with significant demand potential, including the Northeast, Southeast and California.
Our industry

We are committed to developing advanced LED technology solutions that enable our customers to run their facilities with greater energy efficiency, productivity and employee wellness. We strive to be the lighting retrofit technology solutions leader, providing high-quality, energy-efficient, “flicker-free”, long-lived, and mercury-free TLED products as retrofit solutions to replace existing linear fluorescent lamp products in general purpose lighting applications and HID lamps in low-bay and high bay lighting applications. We believe these applications represent a dominant portion of the LED lighting market and energy savings potential for our targeted commercial, industrial and military maritime markets. 
The U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) has been a leading advocate of the solid-state lighting (“SSL”) revolution and has supported various studies forecasting the market penetration of LEDs in general lighting applications since 2002. Based on the DOE’s research, the case for the transition to LED lighting technology solutions is compelling. The DOE published their “Energy Saving Forecast of Solid-State Lighting in General Illumination Applications” in September 2016 (“DOE Report”), outlining the future path for SSL. Currently, fluorescent lighting systems represent almost half of all lighting energy consumption across all U.S. markets, creating a significant energy savings opportunity for LED lighting. The DOE’s market

analysis assumes the market adoption of LED lighting will be driven by improvements in LED product efficacy, price and technological improvements, including connected lighting. The DOE Report defines connected lighting as an LED lighting system with integrated sensors and controllers that are networked, enabling lighting products within the system to communicate with each other and transmit data. If the DOE’s SSL Program Goal for LED efficacy for the U.S. are met and accelerated consumer adoption of connected lighting is achieved, the market penetration of LEDs is projected to drive a 75 percent reduction in U.S. energy consumption, the equivalent to the energy consumed by 45 million U.S. homes, in 2035 alone. 
According to the DOE Report, the 75 percent reduction in energy will be driven largely by linear fixtures, including retrofit applications, and low and high bay product categories, principally in the commercial and industrial markets. The DOE Report further estimated the 2015 LED penetration rates in the U.S. for fixtures and low and high bay products was approximately three percent and six percent, respectively, increasing to penetration rates of 77 percent for fixtures and 86 percent for low and high bay products by 2035. The DOE Report further estimated commercial and industrial penetration rates between 8 and 12 percent in 2015, increasing to between 83 percent and 86 percent by 2035. 
We estimate the 2017 North American commercial and industrial linear fixtures market, including retrofit applications, to be approximately $16.0 billion. While the overall revenue within linear fixture market is forecasted to decline at a 0.5 percent CAGR through 2026, LED lamps within this product category are forecast to increase at a 5.7 percent CAGR for the same time period. Within the commercial and industrial markets we estimate the 2017 overall penetration rate for LED lamps to approximate 21 percent. The estimated penetration rates for healthcare and education markets, two markets that value our high quality, high efficacy and less than one percent flicker, are estimated to be 14 percent and 26 percent, respectively. As the efficiency and cost of LED lighting continue to improve, we believe that market adoption will accelerate, particularly in commercial and industrial applications and that we are well positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity.

Sales and marketing

Historically our products were sold through a direct sales model, which included a combination of direct sales employees, electrical and lighting contractors, and distributors. The 2017 restructuring initiative included the transition to an agency driven sales channel strategy in order to expand our market presence throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, we had effectively transitioned our sales force to an agency driven sales channel, expanding our sales coverage to the entire U.S. through six geographic regions and 30 sales agents. As a result of this transition, we have substantially expanded from a primarily Midwest

focus to build market presence and awareness in other regions of the U.S. with significant demand potential, including the Northeast, Southeast and California.
Targeted vertical markets
We focus on markets where the economic benefits and technical specifications of our lighting product offerings are most compelling. Our LED lighting products fall into two separate applications, commercial markets, focused on quality, efficacy, total cost of ownership and return on investment, and military maritime markets, requiring higher military specifications for durability and dependability.
With the introduction of our military Intellitube® product in 2011, our results had been driven by our military maritime market, accounting for approximately 78 percent of our net sales for the year-ended December 31, 2015. The military maritime competitive landscape changed in late 2016 and we are no longer the only qualified TLED provider for the U.S. Navy. Additionally, we believe that the military maritime market for our military Intellitube® product is limited as we estimate that 50 percent of the Navy’s potentially replaceable fluorescent tubes had been retrofitted with our military Intellitube® product through December 31, 2017. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 our military maritime market accounted for 23 percent and 52 percent of our net sales, respectively. We continue to diversify our military maritime business through the development of LED fixtures, globe and berth lights and our continued efforts to expand sales beyond the U.S. Navy into foreign navies, the military sealift command, U.S. Coast Guard, commercial shipping companies, and military bases.
In light of the changing military maritime market, over the past three years we have been focused on expanding our commercial and industrial market presence where the economic benefits and technical specifications of our lighting product offerings are compelling, such as the healthcare, education and industrial verticals.
Given the 24/7 lighting requirements of hospital systems we believe that our LED solutions offer the quality, performance, long lifetime, return on investment and low flicker lightning that is particularly attractive to this target market. Since 2015 we have been the trusted LED lighting partner for a major northeast Ohio hospital system and as a result of our continued success, we have been able to leverage this relationship to introduce our lighting solutions and value proposition to an increasing number of hospital systems. We further believe that the strength of our agency relationships will allow us to further penetrate this market on a regional basis. As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that the LED penetration rate within the healthcare market is approximately 14 percent.
As we advocate for the benefits of low flicker LED lighting in schools, both in terms of energy-efficiency and in creating a healthy and effective learning environment, we continue to receive orders to retrofit local school districts, colleges and universities. Again, we believe that our relationships with our sales agents will allow us to further build awareness of the benefits of low flicker LED lighting, helping us to drive further penetration in this market. As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that the LED penetration rate within the education market is approximately 26 percent.
Low and high bay applications are generally used in commercial and industrial markets to provide light to large open areas like big-box retail stores, warehouses and manufacturing facilities. In the past few years, technological and cost improvements have allowed LED low and high bay applications to be more competitive against traditional low and high bay applications. In the industrial market in particular, due to the usage of HID lighting, the energy savings that can be achieved by switching to our LED products could be substantial and we believe we have attractive product offerings in this space.
Concentration of sales

Consistent with our efforts to diversify our customer base, three customers accounted for 48.4 percent, of net sales in 2017, compared to two customers accounting for 47.4 percent of net sales in 2016. In 2017, our commercial sales accounted for 76.7 percent of net sales while sales of our military maritime products accounted for 23.3 percent. In 2017, two commercial customers, a major northeastern Ohio hospital system and a large regional retrofit company accounted for 18.3 percent, and 12.8 percent of net sales, respectively, while sales to distributors to the U.S. Navy represented 22.0 percent of net sales. No other customers accounted for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2017.
Competition

Our LED lighting products compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and HID lamps, as well as other TLEDs and full fixture lighting products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance and lower total cost of ownership of our products. Principal competitors in our markets include large lamp manufacturers and lighting fixture companies based in the U.S., as well as TLED 
7

manufacturers mostly based in Asia, whose financial resources may substantially exceed and cost structure may be well below ours. These competitors may introduce new or improved products that may reduce or eliminate some of the competitive advantage of our products. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and/or advanced features. We compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies such as Philips Lighting, CREE, Osram Sylvania and GE Lighting, as well as, smaller manufacturers or distributors such as LED Smart, Revolution Lighting Technologies and Orion Energy Systems. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products.

Manufacturing and suppliers
We produce our lighting products and systems through a combination of internal manufacturing and assembly at our Solon, Ohio facility, and sourced finished goods, manufactured to our specifications. Our internal lighting system manufacturing consists primarily of final assembly, testing, and quality control. We have worked with several vendors to design custom components to meet our specific needs. Our quality assurance program provides for testing of all sub-assemblies at key stages in the assembly process, as well as testing of finished products produced both internally and sourced through third parties.
Manufacturing costs are managed through the balance of internal production and an outsourced production model for certain parts and components, as well as finished goods in specific product lines, to a small number of vendors in various locations throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Taiwan, and China. In some cases, we rely upon a single supplier to source certain components, sub-assemblies, or finished goods. We continually attempt to improve our global supply chain practices to satisfy client demands in terms of quality and volumes, while controlling our costs and achieving targeted gross margins.
Product development

Product development is a key area of operating focus and competitive differentiation for us and we are dedicated to designing and developing industry leading LED lighting products. Gross product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $2.9 million, $3.6 million, and $3.0 million respectively. 

Intellectual property

We have a policy of seeking to protect our intellectual property through patents, license agreements, trademark registrations, confidential disclosure agreements, and trade secrets as management deems appropriate. We have approximately 10 patents that we consider key to our current product lines. Additionally, we have various pending United States patent applications, and various pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization that serve as the basis for national patent filings in countries of interest. Our issued patents expire at various times through July 2032. Generally, the term of patent protection is twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. There can be no assurance; however, that our issued patents are valid or that any patents applied for will be issued, and that our competitors or clients will not copy aspects of our lighting systems or obtain information that we regard as proprietary. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop products similar to ours. The laws of some foreign countries in which we manufacture, sell or may sell our products do not protect proprietary rights to products to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

Insurance

All of our properties and equipment are covered by insurance and we believe that such insurance is adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance in amounts we believe to be consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.
Employees

At December 31, 2017, we had 74 full-time employees, seven of whom were located in Taiwan and 67 in the United States. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Business segments

We currently operate in a single business segment that includes the marketing and sale of commercial and military maritime lighting products. Please refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations” and Note 12, “Product and Geographic Information,” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, for additional information.
