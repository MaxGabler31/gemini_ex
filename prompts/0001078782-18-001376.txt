Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Marizyme Incorporated, (formerly GBS Enterprises Incorporated), a Nevada corporation (the “Company,” “Marizyme”, “GBS,” “GBSX,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions), conducted its primary business through its minority owned subsidiary, GBS Software AG (“GROUP”), a German-based public-company whose stock trades on the Frankfurt Exchange under the stock symbol INW. GROUP’s software and consulting business was focused on serving IBM’s Lotus Notes and Domino market. GROUP provided IBM Lotus Notes/Domino Application and Transformation technology. Headquartered in Karlsruhe, Germany, the Company had offices throughout Europe and North America. GROUP maintained a website at www.gbs-ag.com. The information contained in GROUP’s websites is not incorporated by reference herein. On March 21, 2018, GBS formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Marizyme, Incorporated, a Nevada Corporation, and merged it with GBS Enterprises effectively renaming the company Marizyme 
 
Marizyme currently retains the former GBS GroupLive assets and retains a subsidiary, X-Assets, Incorporated (“X-ASSETS”), a Nevada company. X-ASSETS currently holds our minority stake in GROUP and we intend to distribute the shares of X-ASSETS as part of a type-D business restructuring upon receiving regulatory approval. 
 
Marizyme intends to refocus in the life sciences space and seek technologies to acquire. No life sciences acquisitions have been completed as of the date of this filing and no assurances can be given when an acquisition may be consummated. 
    The Company’s Common Stock has been historically quoted on the OTC Markets’ OTCQB under the ticker symbol “GBSX.” However, because the Company failed to file this Annual Report with the SEC by the April 15, 2014 extended deadline, the Company’s Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink sheets. Upon the filing of this Annual Report, or shortly thereafter, we anticipate changing our ticker symbol and that our Common Stock will be restored to the OTCQB, although no assurance can be given. 
    Historically, we grew our operations by acquiring companies which have developed software and specialized services for the Lotus Notes and Domino market. Our products and services may no longer remain in use. New technologies, especially in the areas of Cloud Computing and Mobile applications, have grown in popularity due to the potential cost savings and operational efficiencies they can offer. Our software and consulting offerings were no longer needed. 
 
In 2011, we acquired and developed technologies that help organizations reduce the time, cost, resources and risks associated with these highly complex Migration and Modernization projects.
 
In 2012, in order to reduce overhead and administrative costs, we decided to restructure the Company’s multilevel subsidiary-structure. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we restructured several subsidiaries. Also in 2012, we made changes in our management structure, appointed five independent members to our Board of Directors and formed Board committees, including an Audit Committee. The Board of Directors of the Company appointed Gary D. MacDonald on July 11, 2012 as the Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.
 
In 2013 we continued to restructure the Company’s subsidiary structure and focused on the core competences of the organization. In February 2013 we sold 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiary IDC Global Inc. Following the restructuring activities the Board of Directors of the Company reappointed Joerg Ott on July 10, 2013, has the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) of the Company, effective immediately. 
 
In 2014 the company’s Board of Directors approved the filing of Form 15 with the SEC on April 23, 2014. As part of our restructuring program we decided that the OTC Markets were the appropriate market trading platform and we would benefit from cost savings and operational effectiveness. As an essential part of our restructuring program we sold a significant amount of stock in GROUP on June 6, 2014 for a total of $348,250.
 
In 2015, following an in-depth market investigation, we made preparations to subsequently dispose of all other major shareholdings by way of sale.
 
In 2016, we prepared for our further restructuring. As a result, we sold our full investment in GBS Pavone GmbH effective as of December 1, 2016. We also sold our stake in GBS India as of December 31, 2016 by way of a management buy-out. These actions transformed GBSX into single entity with no further subsidiaries and prepared the company for a new business model.

After extended discussions with its main shareholders and the Board of Directors in 2016, the Company sold the rest of its controlling investments, which had previously begun in 2013. As a result, all subsidiaries of the company were sold effective December 31, 2016. Since then, the company has managed only a minority interest of stock of a German public entity with no controlling interest. In this context, the formerly filed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2012 are fully replaced by those of an individual company filed herewith. For comparative purposes and in the interests of maximum transparency, the statements of the company for the 2012-2017 financial years refer to the status of Marizyme Inc. as an unconsolidated company. 
 
In 2017, we expanded our discussions on establishing a new business model in the biotechnology and/or life sciences sector and, to preserve the greatest possible value for our shareholders, prepared for the necessary resolutions to seek shareholder approval for the Board of Directors to execute on in early 2018. 
 
Going forward, the Company intends focus on the life sciences business but does not yet own any life sciences or biotechnology assets.

Pavone AG. On April 1, 2011, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Pavone AG, a German corporation (“Pavone”), for $350,000 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of GBS common stock. The fair value of the GBS common stock was determined to be $4.90 per share, representing the market value at the end of trading on the date of the acquisition. The total value of the investment, including the assumption of $583,991 in debt, was $5,833,991. Pavone’s workflow software for Lotus Notes and Domino along with their large customer base was believed to be well suited for GBS Enterprises’ portfolio strategy. We believed our acquisition of Pavone complements our majority ownership in GROUP, and that the acquisition further strengthens our industry position in the market of IBM Lotus Platforms. 
 
GroupWare, Inc. On June 1, 2011, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of GroupWare, Inc., a Florida corporation (“GroupWare”), for $250,000 and 250,000 shares of GBS common stock.

GroupWare's ePDF server delivers centralized, network-wide PDF solutions for messaging, workflow, document, content and data management. We believed that the acquisition strengthens our migration and modernization offerings by substituting traditional printing methods provided by the Notes client with simple-to-use print-to-PDF capabilities in the browser. In addition, GroupWare provides a solution for applications that are ready to be retired. With the ePDF Server, our customers could convert the entire contents of IBM Lotus Notes and Domino applications to a permanent and secure archive in PDF or PDF/A format, while preserving their ability to be full-text searched and ensuring that the critical application data is accessible in the future, when needed. 
    IDC Global, Inc. On July 25, 2011, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of IDC Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“IDC”), for 880,000 shares of GBS common stock and $775,000. The fair value of the GBS common stock was determined to be $3.70 per share, representing the market value at the end of trading on the date of the agreement. The total value of the investment, including $35,000 of debt assumption, was $4,066,000. IDC services included nationwide network and data center services. IDC delivers customized, high availability technology solutions for WAN, Wireless Services, Co-location & Hosting, Managed Services, and Network Security. IDC Global included two Data Center facilities located in the downtown Chicago area and Colocation facilities in three other Data Centers in New York, London, England and Frankfurt, Germany. IDC provides internet infrastructure Services (IaaS) to the business community helping customers make the transition from large, static and expensive on-premise computing to dynamic, flexible and cost-effective off-premise computing.
 

SD Holdings, Ltd. On November 1, 2011, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of SD Holdings Ltd., a Mauritius corporation (“SYN”), for $525,529 and 612,874 shares of GBS common stock. The fair value of the GBS common stock was determined to be $2.05 per share, representing the market value at the end of trading on the date of the agreement. SYN owns 100% of Synaptris, Inc., a California corporation (“Synaptris”), and Synaptris Decisions Private Limited, an India company.
 
Synaptris’ product portfolio improved corporate decision-making by providing real-time enterprise reporting, user defined dashboards, and comprehensive analytic capabilities for Lotus Notes / Domino and Java/.NET environments. Synaptris employed 70 people and had operations in the US, Europe, and India, with over 2,500 customers in 80 countries, including over one hundred Fortune 1000 companies
 
With the integration of the Synaptris product portfolio, we added another tier of Lotus Notes applications including reporting products, advanced dashboards, and email productivity solutions. Additionally, the Synaptris acquisition included a comprehensive search engine specialized for use with email that is faster and easier to use than other products in the market.
 
In addition to product synergy and additional revenue streams, we expect to derive operational synergy from this acquisition. Synaptris’ presence in India was anticipated to accelerate our plan to expand our product development team particularly for our strategic offerings in India.

Changes in Corporate Governance 
 
As previously reported by the Company on a Form 8-K filed with the Commission on July 10, 2013, on July 10, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company reappointed Joerg Ott as the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) of the Company, effective immediately. Mr. Ott replaced Mr. Gary D. MacDonald who had been serving as the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer since July 11, 2012. Mr. Ott has been the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors until May 4, 2018. 
 
On May 4, 2018 Mr. Ott resigned and the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Nicholas P. DeVito as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.
    Subsidiaries
 
At December 31, 2017, all former subsidiaries have been closed or sold. On May 4, 2018 we exchanged all of our shares of GROUP for the shares of the newly formed X-ASSETS, to effect a Type-D business restructuring. We intend to distribute the shares of X-ASSETS to the existing GBS shareholders upon receiving appropriate approval from regulatory agencies. 
Intellectual Property
    We do not own any patents or trademarks.
 
We own the internet domain name, www.gbsx.us. GROUP owns www.gbs-ag.com. The information contained in the Company’s and GROUP’s websites is not incorporated by reference herein. 
 
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we sold products do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad were adequate or that competition will not independently develop similar technology.
    We were also dependent on third-party suppliers for certain software which is embedded in some of our products. 
 
Research and Development
    We focused our research and development efforts on developing new products and needed technologies in our strategic areas and markets and to further enhance functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing products. Except for the GroupLive assets we are no longer in the software products or services business.
Government Regulation
 
As the internet continued to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies and industry groups became more likely. Going forward we will face government regulations related to future life science assets if they can be acquired.
Competition
 
The competitive landscape in the information technology (IT) market and the enterprise data center market is intense and changing. Heavy competition in this space caused our software businesses to decline substantially and as a result we closed those businesses and will be refocusing on future acquisitions in the life sciences space if they can be found. 
Revenues
 
Based on current market demands for modern, Cloud-enabled and mobile-device capable business applications, revenues for our former software business have declined substantially causing us to reevaluate our future direction. We intend to focus on acquiring life sciences assets although no assurances can be provided that we will consummate any transaction. 
 
In the past, we generated revenue from subscription and usage fees and related services, including support and strategic consulting services. The subscription period was typically based on a yearly or multi-year contract with our customers. Our portfolio also included a set of analysis tools known as Insights that identified all of the Lotus Notes applications within an organization and provided metrics about the uses and users of those applications. 

9



We also generated revenue with our analysis tools by charging a fee for the use of our technology and for the associated cost of the services to produce a report and set of recommendations for the customer. Additional revenues came from consulting services that resulted from helping our customers to implement those recommendations. 
 
We believe there is no longer significant revenue opportunity in licensing these tools or selling consulting services to customers.
 
Employees
    At December 31, 2017, the Company had one executive officer: Joerg Ott (Chief Executive Officer). 
 
At December 31, 2017, we had no full time employees, a reduction of 249 full time employees compared to 249 full time employees from December 31, 2012 mainly resulting from reductions in our software businesses. The disclosure below pertains to the activities of all subsidiaries, including GROUP, our minority subsidiary:
General Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on March 20, 2007 as SWAV Enterprises Ltd. (“SWAV”). SWAV had a different management team and was in a different industry. 
    On September 6, 2010, SWAV’s name was changed to GBS Enterprises Incorporated. On October 14, 2010, the Company’s trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board was changed from SWAV to GBSX.
 
On March 21, 2018, GBS formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Marizyme, Incorporated, a Nevada Corporation, and merged it with GBS Enterprises effectively renaming the company Marizyme. 
 
Marizyme currently retains the former GBS GroupLive assets and retains a subsidiary, X-Assets, Incorporated (“X-ASSETS”), a Nevada company. X-ASSETS currently holds our minority stake in GROUP and we intend to distribute the shares of X-ASSETS as part of a type-D business restructuring upon receiving regulatory approval. 
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On March 23, 2018 we held a shareholders vote seeking approval to reverse-split our Common Stock. The shareholders approved a reverse split of 29 shares of existing Common Stock in exchange for 1 new share of Common Stock. We are seeking regulatory approval to implement this reverse split.
