ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. (“CPHC”), its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation (“CURE Pharmaceutical”), Cure Chemistry Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “CHI”) and The Sera Labs, Inc. (“Sera Labs”) (CPHC, CURE Pharmaceutical, CHI and Sera Labs, collectively the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or “CURE”) is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and manufacturing of drug formulation and drug delivery technologies in novel dosage forms to improve drug safety, efficacy and patient adherence. Our mission is to improve lives by redefining how medications are delivered and experienced. Our primary business model is to develop wellness and drug products using our proprietary technology, which development may include preclinical and clinical studies and regulatory approval, grant product rights to partners responsible for marketing, sales and distribution, while retaining exclusive manufacturing rights and market sell and distribute branded health, wellness, and beauty products through Sera Labs. We operate in a 25,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing plant in Oxnard, CA. 

Our technology platform includes oral thin film (“OTF”), and encapsulation systems (“microCURE”) compatible with OTF, chews, oral solutions, topical and transdermal dose forms. We apply our technology to pharmaceutical drugs and dietary supplements and topical products for the wellness market. OTF products are about the size of a postage stamp and composed of excipients such as polymers, stabilizers, lipids and surfactants, which are all generally recognized as safe. They can be designed to deliver active ingredients to the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract when placed on the tongue and swallowed, or directly to the blood stream when placed under the tongue (sublingual) or on the inner lining of the cheek and lip (buccal).

We sell multiple commercial wellness products under our distribution partners’ brands as well as through Sera Labs under the Nutri-Strip, Sera Topical, and Sera Topical Revolution brands. We also develop 50,000IU and Vitamin D3 OTF for oral administration to be distributed by Meroven Pharmaceuticals in the United States and the MENA region. Our pharmaceutical drug program includes: 

CUREfilm Blue

A 25mg and 50mg sildenafil OTF for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. We have completed our pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), confirming a 505(b)(2) regulatory path. 

 CUREfilm Canna 

We are developing several cannabinoid products with optimized pharmacokinetic profiles using microCURE and CUREfilm technology. 

CUREfilm Anti-Viral

We are developing an orally bio-available anti-viral of an existing therapeutic leveraging existing pre-clinical/clinical safety and toxicity data. 

 CUREfilm Central Nervous System (CNS)

 In the area of CNS indications, we are developing a novel dosage form of a difficult to treat disease states utilizing our proprietary CUREfilm dosage form. These could include but are not limited to mental health disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety. 

Background

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. On November 7, 2016, we changed our name from Makkanotti Group Corp. to CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. On September 27, 2019, the Company reincorporated from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware.

On October 2, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Sera Labs, a Delaware corporation pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 23, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Cure Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), Sera Labs and Nancy Duitch, in her capacity as the security holders representative. The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of Sera Labs by the Company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Sera Labs, with Sera Labs surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”).

Impact of COVID-19 

Our financial results and operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures we have taken to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, and to promote the safety and security of our employees remain in place. In accordance with public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, we have imposed travel restrictions, adopted policies aimed at promoting social distancing, and implemented work-from-home arrangements for employees where practicable. These measures and our compliance with local and national guidelines aimed at containing the virus could impact our operations and disrupt our business. Currently, our single operating facility is operational, and no reduction in our work force has taken place due to COVID-19. 

CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation

Our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business, CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation, located in Oxnard, California was originally incorporated in July 2011 to develop novel drug formulation and delivery technologies.

The pharmaceutical industry is facing ever-growing R&D expenditures and fewer new drug approvals as a result of increasing regulation, a failure to predict safety problems or a lack of efficacy early in a drug’s development, and high investment in new technologies to improve the speed and accuracy of drug development. Researching and developing new molecular entities (NMEs) is risky as measured by an ever-increasing R&D spend (13.4% average increase per year), low clinical trial success rate (10%) and sluggish NME drug approvals – with 48 NMEs approved in 2019, down from 55 in 2018. Faced with these challenges, drug developers are looking toward alternative dosage forms, for which R&D investments dwarves those of NMEs. Alternative dosage forms can address safety and efficacy limitations observed during clinical development of an NME using conventional formulations, by improving its pharmacokinetic profile. 

In addition to these challenges, many marketed drugs are coming off-patent, creating a need to fill revenue gaps. Novel dosage forms can offer strategies for surviving patent cliffs by extending market exclusivity when they address a bona fide unmet need.

The pharmaceutical industry is also challenged by the many patients who do not adhere to a regime of prescription drugs because of side effects, difficulty in administration or the taste of a drug. According to HealthPrize and Capgemini, the loss of global revenues by drug makers due to non-adherence to medicines is $630 billion every year and according to a recent paper published in The Annals of Pharmacotherapy titled “Cost of Prescription Drug-Related Morbidity and Mortality” the estimated annual cost of prescription drug-related morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy was $528.4 billion in 2016 US dollars and about 275,689 deaths per year. Medication adherence and the patient experience can be improved with strategies such as replacing an injectable drug with a sublingual drug, simplifying the dosing schedule with a sustained release dosage form and reducing toxicities by avoiding the GI tract (e.g. through transdermal or transmucosal delivery).

Improved formulations can address these many challenges by cutting down development costs, reducing the time to market, extending product patent protection, improving patient compliance and increasing drug efficacy. For example, reformulation can enable drug repositioning, the process of finding new uses for failed drugs, such as those abandoned for lack of efficacy or excessive toxicity after Phase II trials, or marketed drugs for which new uses will extend patent life and, therefore, profitability.

The FDA approves more reformulations than new chemical entities (NCEs) each year under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“505(b)(2)”). The number of 2018 NDA approvals that used the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway rose dramatically from 45 approvals in 2016 to an all-time high of 75 in 2018, 64 in 2019 and 68 in 2020. Under Section (505)(b)(2), the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or indication for use. Taken together, the exclusivity period of a drug and the lower R&D cost for reformulating a drug, have led to some pharmaceutical companies investigating reformulating their drugs as part of their lifecycle management protocols.

Furthermore, patients are increasingly encouraged to take part in their own treatments, and a consumer market has been developing midway between the supermarket-based world of consumer goods companies and the scientific, pharmacy-based world of pharmaceutical firms. The front lines of this battle are wellness products that have been proven to help prevent or cure disease. Breakthroughs in functional medicine suggest a number of opportunities for pharmaceutical companies like CURE. Functional medicines focus on the imbalances underlying disease processes (rather than only symptomatic relief) and they rely on molecular nutrition for patient-specific solutions. These types of nutraceuticals can be synergistic with pharmaceutical treatments, particularly in the emerging endocannabinoid medical market.

Our Strategy

Our commercial strategy is designed to mitigate risk by pursuing a diversified model in the following categories:

Pharmaceuticals

We partner with companies that are responsible for marketing and distribution of the products we develop and manufacture. On a case-by-case basis, we may be responsible for clinical development and regulatory approval with the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies. Deal terms may include upfront licensing fees, development costs, milestone payments, royalties and exclusive manufacturing rights. Within this category, we are pursuing products with 505(b)(2) approval pathways such as our Sildenafil OTF – CUREfilm Blue. While we currently manufacture nutraceutical products in our state-of-the-art cGMP oral dissolving film manufacturing facility, we are undertaking steps to manufacture pharmaceutical products for commercial use.
Cannabinoids and Other Schedule 1 Drugs

We are specifically investing in pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid products, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The oral bioavailability of cannabinoids is very low due to extensive “first-pass” metabolism. Consequently, potency and release times are unpredictable and inconsistent. Moreover, cannabinoids do not readily dissolve in water, which adds to dosing difficulties and discrepancies. In addition to improving bioavailability, CUREfilm enables the loading of combinations of cannabinoids and botanical extracts, which may provide maximum therapeutic benefit. 

We are sponsoring preclinical cannabinoid research at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, where the laboratory of Dr. Dedi Meiri is identifying specific combinations of cannabinoids with anti-tumor effects. We are registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) to manufacture Schedule 1 controlled substances at the Oxnard facility.

Wellness 

We focus on evidence-based wellness products that are differentiated by using proprietary and/or proven active ingredients that we formulate for greater stability, overall quality and increased bioavailability. Wellness products can be cosmetics, OTC or dietary supplements which do not require FDA approval but do require following all GMPs. Thus, they are less costly and faster to launch in the marketplace. We sell white labeled and private labeled wellness products, which we produce in our state-of-the-art cGMP manufacturing facility. While manufacturing fees for such products have lower margins than prescription drugs, they provide us with short term revenue opportunities. 

Our recently acquired wholly-owned subsidiary, Sera Labs, is a trusted leader in the health, wellness, and beauty sectors of innovative products with cutting edge technology and superior ingredients such as CBD. Sera Labs creates high quality products that use science-backed, proprietary formulations. More than 25 products are sold under the brand names Seratopical™, Seratopical Revolution™ SeraLabs™, and Nutri-Strips™. Sera Labs sells its products at affordable prices, making them easily accessible on a global scale. Strategically positioned in the growth market categories of beauty, health & wellness, and pet care, Sera Labs products are sold in major national drug, grocery chains, convenience stores and mass retailers. The company also sells products under private label to major retailers and multi-level marketers, as well as direct-to-consumer (DTC), via online website orders, including opt-in subscriptions.

In December 2020, Nicole Kidman became the Global Brand Ambassador and Strategic Partner for Seratopical Skincare. In addition to being the face of the brand, Nicole Kidman plays an integral role in the strategic direction of product development and messaging. This partnership allows for women of all skin tones and types to look and feel their best by using Sera Labs’ industry best ingredients.

Our Technology

As a drug delivery company, we seek to grow our technological capabilities through internal innovation and acquisitions. On May 13, 2019, we acquired CHI, a formulation technology company that developoed innovative delivery systems for wellness and pharmaceutical products. This acquisition allowed us to address the increased demand for solid, chewable, liquid and dermal products for immediate and controlled-release, particularly for poorly soluble molecules such as cannabinoids. 

Our expanded formulation and delivery platform, CUREformTM combines the right formulation with the right dosage form. In addition to novel chewable dosage forms, the acquisition gave us advanced encapsulation capabilities (microCURE) that serve to: 


· | Protect molecules from degradation during the manufacturing process and throughout shelf life
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Protect molecules from degradation in the body (e.g. stomach acids); and 
· | Increase a drug’s bioavailability and optimize its release kinetics through: 


· | Increased solubility in water and therefore bodily fluids
--+----------------------------------------------------------
· | Enhanced permeability and retention in target tissue 


CUREfilmTM Technology

The founders of CURE Pharmaceutical are pioneers in drug delivery and OTF, having launched the first therapeutic OTF product, Chloraseptic® relief strips in 2003. OTF products are about the size of a postage stamp and can deliver medicines through the mucosal tissue in the mouth, sublingually or buccally – on the cheek or more traditionally via the GI tract. Oral transmucosal drug delivery is a non-invasive route for drug delivery that allows for absorption directly into the vascularized tissue in the mouth, bypassing the hepatic first pass effect. This leads to reduced drug exposure and can offer a rapid onset of action. As an OTF, active ingredients can be either pre-solubilized within the matrix or encapsulated, or both for more effective GI absorption and/or sustained release. The quick dissolution nature of OTF means that no water is required for administration, improving patient compliance - especially among the elderly, children, and in conditions where patients have difficulty in swallowing.

OTFs have significant advantages compared to other dosage forms (e.g., tablets and capsules), including:


6

Safety and Efficacy


· | Potential for rapid onset of action, which can be especially useful for indications such as motion sickness, erectile dysfunction, seizures, allergic attack or coughing, bronchitis or asthma.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Potential to extend a drug’s half-life and consequently extending dosage intervals. 
· | Transmucosal delivery can improve a drug’s safety profile of therapy such as reduced gastric irritation. 
· | Transmucosal delivery can improve a drug’s efficacy in patients with GI absorption issues. 
· | Accuracy in the administered dose can be better assured for each film. 

Patient Experience and Medication Adherence


· | Difficulty swallowing tablets and capsules can be a problem for many individuals and can lead to a variety of adverse events and patient noncompliance with treatment regimens. It is estimated that over 16 million people in the United States have some difficulty swallowing, also known as dysphagia. Studies in adults evaluating the effect of tablet and capsule size on ease of swallowing suggest that increases in size are associated with increases in patient complaints related to swallowing difficulties at tablet sizes greater than approximately 8 mm in diameter. OTFs can readily be taken without the need to swallow or use of water or other beverages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Upon administration, there is a relatively low risk of the patient choking which can be most beneficial for patients suffering from motion sickness, dysphagia and repeated emesis. 
· | Easily administered to bedridden and non-cooperative patients (e.g., geriatric, pediatric, and psychiatric). They are hard to spit out. 
· | Configured with physical dimensions such that it is relatively easy and convenient to store and carry. Patients can conveniently carry multiple dissolvable films in his or her pocket or wallet. A single dose of strip can be carried individually without requiring the secondary container. 
· | OTFs are flexible with a pleasant mouth feel unlike oral dissolvable tablets which are brittle. 


Manufacturing and logistics


· | The pouches or sachets offer larger printable 2D areas which traditional drug product formats do not. This allows the manufacturer to adapt to rapidly evolving labeling and regulatory requirements for information and anti-counterfeiting, such as product serialization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The manufacturing process has a low carbon footprint, with lower use of water for component preparation and sterilization as compared with other dosage forms. 
· | Even though not necessarily sterile, each dose unit is packed individually avoiding contact with other units. 
· | Tensile strength and plasticity of OTF allow for handling single, individual dose units without damage to the dosage form. 
· | Multiple SKUs can be produced by simply modifying the length of the OTF. 
· | Enables anti-counterfeit management and dose management. 
· | Adaptable for use with dispensing devices for pharmacy preparation or self-administration. 
· | Can be easily and conveniently handled, stored, and transported at room temperature. 


The CUREfilm platform is a scalable and versatile formulation and drug delivery system for both oral (OTF) and transdermal (skin) delivery. We believe that CUREfilm formulations can improve or match the pharmacokinetics of drugs in accordance with the desired outcome. The platform is compatible with a broad spectrum of molecules, for the formulation of both investigational and marketed prescription drugs and nutraceutical products.

The specific advantages below are present with multiple CUREfilm products and platform technologies. The advantages listed below are expressly described in CURE’s patent documents. Other advantages are present in specific products and platform technologies, but not outlined in the patent documents and kept as trade secrets and proprietary equipment designs. Additional advantages are described in pending and unpublished patent documents, including, but not limited to the following:


· | loading of multiple active ingredients on one dose unit; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ability to accommodate high drug load per dose unit (e.g. > 200 mg); 
· | quickly dissolving/disintegrating (e.g. < 2 minutes); 
· | potential for low moisture level (e.g. < 10 wt.% water); 
· | ability to achieve desired performance characteristics while maintaining pleasant feeling in the mouth (e.g. soft, plush feeling with pliable film); 
· | ability to achieve desired performance characteristics while formulating active ingredients susceptible to degradation from low pH environments, light, heat, moisture, and oxygen; and
· | multiple and unique ways to mask the bitter, metallic or salty taste of an active ingredient.

Intellectual Property

The competitive advantages of the CUREformTM platform and products are protected by issued and ending patents, as well as trade secrets such as proprietary equipment design and manufacturing processes, which allow us to produce CUREform products at commercial scale in a cGMP environment. We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable claims of our patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on ourproprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We own or have exclusive rights to fourteen (14) issued U.S. patents, two (2) allowed U.S. patents, twenty three (23) pending applications in the United States, one (1) issued patent in China and one (1) international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent application. These patents and applications relate, among others, to: 


· | a method and apparatus for minimizing heat, moisture, and shear damage to medicant incorporated into an edible film;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | edible films for administration of medicaments to animals;

Competition

We face competition from pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, wellness and nutraceutical companies, as well as organizations developing advanced drug delivery platforms such as Lonza, Aquestive Therapeutics, BioDelivery Sciences International, IntelGenx, ARx Pharma and LTS Lohmann, which have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Furthermore, we face competition from these entities as well as universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our success will be based in part on our ability to develop and manufacture products that address unmet medical needs and create value to patients at competitive price points. In addition, continuing to build our intellectual property portfolio and designing innovative approaches that surpass our competitors’ patents will be critical to success. 
Recent Developments 

On January 5, 2021, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had approved an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for its product CUREfilm Blue™, an oral soluble film of sildenafil citrate (the active ingredient present in Viagra®) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”). The Company is seeking approval of this product via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to expedite the U.S. approval process. Viagra® is a registered trademark of Pfizer, Inc.

On February 23, 2021, the Company announced the start of its initial Pharmacokinetics (PK)/bioequivalence studies in support of a previously approved IND application with the FDA. This application has been initiated via the 505(b)(2) drug approval pathway, and is in continuation of FDA-provided feedback in support of the Company’s clinical development plans for its CUREfilm Blue™, an oral soluble film of sildenafil citrate (the active ingredient present in Viagra®) for the treatment of ED.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, Sera Labs began selling its facial products of the Seratopical Revolution™ line in CVS. CVS is one of the leading national drug store chains in America. Seratopical Revolution™ marries nature and science into one clean and nourishing line of beauty products. The line’s P3P complex, developed by CURE Pharmaceutical, drives natural, clean, plant-based ingredients into the deeper layers of the skin by utilizing a proprietary tri-peptide delivery system. Unlike other companies that use alcohol as a delivery system, which is incredibly drying to the skin, Seratopical Revolution’s natural oil and surfactant delivery systems are highly efficacious and offer near immediate results.

Licensing Agreements

On February 3, 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Releaf Europe b.v., a medical cannabis company based in the Netherlands, under which it will license its microCURE technology for use in topicals and oral solutions. The royalty-bearing license is exclusive to the Netherlands.

On February 11, 2020, the Company entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Vanguard Scientific Systems, a botanical extraction equipment manufacturer, under which rights were granted to the Company’s super-critical fluid cannabis extraction patents which cover methods enabled by the licensee’s extraction equipment. 

Acquisitions

On October 2, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Sera Labs, a Delaware corporation pursuant to the Sera Labs Merger Agreement, by and among the Company, Sera Labs Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Sera Labs and Mrs. Duitch, in her capacity as the security holder’s representative regarding the Sera Labs Merger.

All issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Sera Labs were converted into the right to receive, subject to customary adjustments, an aggregate of approximately (i) $1.0 million in cash (the “Upfront Payment”) and (ii) up to 6,909,091 shares of the Company’s common stock. On October 1, 2020, the Parties entered into a Waiver of Closing Condition, pursuant to which the Company’s obligation to pay the Upfront Payment at the Effective Time was extended to October 13, 2020. The Company has paid $0.3 million of the Upfront Payment with the remaining balance of $0.7 million, plus $0.1 million of shareholder loans made to Sera Labs prior to closing of the Merger, were converted into a promissory note due to the Duitch Living Trust (“Duitch Promissory Note”). The Duitch Promissory Note bears interest at 8% per annum with a maturity date of June 30, 2021, which was amended with a new maturity date of April 15, 2022.

Pursuant to the Sera Labs Merger Agreement, Sera Labs security holders are also entitled to receive up to 5,988,024 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Clawback Shares”) based on the achievement of certain sales milestones up to an aggregate maximum amount of $20 million as set forth in the Sera Labs Merger Agreement. Subsequent to the Effective Time and for a period of two years, the Company agreed to make available to Sera Labs $4.0 million for working capital, less the outstanding amount of the Secured Promissory Note.

Government Regulation Applicable to Us

In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FFDCA”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, distribution, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries will be a significant factor in the manufacturing and potential marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and product development activities. Any product candidate we develop will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical drug products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies, clinical trials and other approval procedures by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources.

Preclinical studies must ordinarily be conducted to evaluate an investigational new drug’s potential safety by toxicology studies and potential efficacy by pharmacology studies. The results of these studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must be reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a three-stage process. Phase I clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers to determine the safety profile and the pattern of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and to assess the drug’s effect on the patient. Phase II, or therapeutic exploratory, trials are conducted with somewhat larger groups of patients, who are selected by relatively narrow criteria yielding a more homogenous population that is afflicted with the target disease, in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. Phase II trials should allow for the determination of the dose to be used in Phase III clinical trials. Phase III, or therapeutic confirmatory, large scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The primary objective of Phase III clinical trials is to show that the drug confers therapeutic benefit that outweighs any safety risks. All clinical trials must be registered with a central public database, such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, and once completed, results of the clinical trials must be entered in the database.

The results of these preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed information on manufacturing, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may refuse to file the application if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria, request additional information or grant marketing approval. Therefore, even if we complete Phase III clinical trials for our product candidates and submit an NDA to the FDA, there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant marketing approval, or if granted, that it will be granted on a timely basis. If the FDA does approve a product candidate, it may require, among other things, post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase IV trials, which monitor the safety of the drug. In addition, the FDA may in some circumstances impose risk evaluation and mitigation strategies that may be difficult and expensive to administer. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.

Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that the applicable clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality control and manufacturing procedures conform on an ongoing basis with current Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, current Good Manufacturing Practices, and computer information system validation standards. During the review of an NDA, the FDA will perform a pre-licensing inspection of select clinical sites, manufacturing facilities and the related quality control records to determine the applicant’s compliance with these requirements. To assure compliance, applicants must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of training, production and quality control. After approval of any product, manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. If a company fails to comply with FDA regulatory requirements, FDA may pursue a wide range of remedial actions, including seizure of products, corrective actions, warning letters and fines.

Other Government Regulations

In addition to laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulation under NIH guidelines as well as under the Controlled Substances Act and implementing regulations from the DEA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local laws and regulations, as our research and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds.

Fraud and Abuse and Privacy and Data Security Laws and Regulations

The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts.

The restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and privacy and data security laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:


· | the federal healthcare Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare items or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. Moreover, the anti-kickback statute is subject to evolving interpretation and there are no safe harbors for many common practices, including patient or product support programs, educational and research grants, or charitable donations. In October 2019, the federal government published a proposed regulation creating new safe harbors for, among other things, certain value-based arrangements and patient engagement tools, and that modifies and clarifies the scope of existing safe harbors for warranties and personal service agreements. The impact of the proposed regulation on our current or contemplated operations is not clear even if the proposed regulation is finalized. We seek to comply with the exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti‑kickback liability;

· | the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals and entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the U.S. Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non‑reimbursable, uses. More recently, federal enforcement agencies are and have been investigating certain pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including manufacturer reimbursement support services, relationships with specialty pharmacies, and grants to independent charitable foundations. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non‑government health benefit programs;

· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;

· | numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. We are not a HIPAA‑covered entity and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, the HIPAA privacy and security requirements do not apply to us (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits). However, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting and/or conspiring to commit a violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely took effect January 1, 2020. The law contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information. The CCPA has substantial penalties for non-compliance, and we continue to assess its impact on our business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals at both the federal and state level that could impose new privacy and security-related obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the European Union (“EU”) is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), an EU-wide regulation that became fully enforceable on May 25, 2018, replacing the EU Data Protection Directive, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze or otherwise use, and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR imposes restrictions on the processing (e.g., collection, use, disclosure) of personal data. These obligations and restrictions concern, in particular, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relate, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or Switzerland, including to the United States, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, as well as substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in substantial fines and administrative penalties. Compliance with GDPR may be onerous and increase our cost of doing business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. These privacy and data security laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, patients about whom we or our partners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business;

· | analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain healthcare providers in the states. Other states prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing‑related activities and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Foreign governments often have similar regulations, which we also will be subject to in those countries where we market and sell products;

· | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“CMS”) information related payments and other transfers of value, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and

· | the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other similar anti‑bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, candidates for foreign political office, or public international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti‑bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. and foreign regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third‑party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative mandatory penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government‑funded healthcare programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws and regulations, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, data security and fraud laws and regulations may prove costly.

Healthcare Reform

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our future product candidates profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our future product candidates. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our future product candidates.

The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”) in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially. The Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our future product candidates.

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had 28 total employees of which all are full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and personnel. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute on our long-term growth strategy. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make our company a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits, and by programs that build connections among our employees. We continue to be committed to an inclusive culture, which values equity, opportunity, and respect. In support of our inclusive culture, we offer competitive compensation and benefits, including stock awards, and strive to recruit a diverse talent pool across all levels of the organization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This included implementing a work-from-home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel.
