Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a specialty materials company organized into two primary businesses: a performance-based technical products business and a premium fine paper and packaging business. 
Our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation, water and other filter media and durable, saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets. We focus on categories where we believe we are, or can be, a market leader. These categories include filtration media for transportation, water and other uses, backings for specialty tapes and abrasives, performance labels, digital image transfer, and other specialty markets. Our dedicated technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Weidach and Bruckmühl, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Bolton, England, Munising, Michigan, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In addition, certain technical products are manufactured along with fine paper and packaging products in shared facilities located in Brattleboro, Vermont, Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania. In 2017, a filtration machine (which was converted from a fine paper machine) began production in Appleton, Wisconsin, a site also shared with the fine paper and packaging business.
Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers in North America. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred brands in North America, where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, major national retailers and specialty businesses. Our primary fine paper and packaging manufacturing facilities are located in Neenah and Whiting, Wisconsin. Certain products are manufactured in shared facilities located in Brattleboro, Vermont, Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania, as well as a site shared with technical products in 2017 in Appleton, Wisconsin. In August 2017, we purchased a laminating asset in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to support continued growth in our premium packaging business.

History of the Businesses
Neenah was incorporated in April 2004 in contemplation of the spin-off by Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark") of its technical products and fine paper businesses in the United States and its Canadian pulp business (collectively, the "Pulp and Paper Business"). We had no material assets or activities until Kimberly-Clark's transfer to us of the Pulp and Paper business on November 30, 2004. On that date, Kimberly-Clark completed the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Kimberly-Clark (the "Spin-Off"). Following the Spin-Off, we are an independent public company and Kimberly-Clark has no ownership interest in us.
Former Pulp Operations.    At the Spin-Off, our pulp operations consisted of mills located in Terrace Bay, Ontario and Pictou, Nova Scotia and approximately 975,000 acres of related woodlands. We disposed of these mills and woodlands in a series of transactions from 2006 to 2010. 
Technical Products.   The Munising, Michigan mill was purchased by Kimberly-Clark in 1952. Subsequent to the purchase, the mill was converted to produce durable, saturated and coated papers for sale and use in a variety of industrial applications for our technical products business. 
In October 2006, we purchased the outstanding interests of FiberMark Services GmbH & Co. KG and the outstanding interests of FiberMark Beteiligungs GmbH (collectively "Neenah Germany"). At acquisition, the Neenah Germany assets consisted of three mills located in Weidach, Bruckmühl and Lahnstein, Germany. These mills produced a wide range of products, including transportation filter media, nonwoven wall coverings, masking and other tapes, abrasive backings, and specialized printing and coating substrates. In October 2015, we sold the Lahnstein mill to the Kajo Neukirchen Group. The Lahnstein mill had been operating as a stand-alone business, manufacturing nonwoven wallcoverings and various other specialty papers. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Discontinued Operations."
In July 2014, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Crane Technical Materials, Inc. from Crane & Co., Inc. The acquired business provides performance-oriented wet laid nonwoven media for water filtration end markets as well as environmental, energy and industrial uses. The business has two manufacturing facilities in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
In November 2017, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Coldenhove. The acquired business is a specialty materials manufacturer based in the Netherlands, with a leading position in digital transfer media and other technical products. The business has one manufacturing facility in Eerbeek, Netherlands. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Acquisitions."
Fine Paper and Packaging.    The fine paper and packaging business was incorporated in 1885 as Neenah Paper Company, which initially operated a single paper mill in Neenah, Wisconsin. Kimberly-Clark acquired the mill in 1956. In 1981, Kimberly-Clark purchased an additional mill located in Whiting, Wisconsin and in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the capacity of the fine paper and packaging business was expanded by building two new paper machines at the Whiting mill and completing a major expansion of the Neenah facility with the installation of a new paper machine, finishing center, customer service center and an expanded distribution center. 
In the first of the series of consolidating acquisitions, in March 2007, we acquired the assets and brands of Fox River (including our mill located in Appleton, Wisconsin). In January 2012, we purchased certain premium fine paper brands and other assets from Wausau Paper Mills, LLC, a subsidiary of Wausau Paper Corp. ("Wausau") and in January 2013, we purchased certain premium business paper brands from the Southworth Company ("Southworth"). 
In August 2017, we purchased a laminating asset in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to support continued growth in our premium packaging business.
Shared Facilities.    In August 2015, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of FiberMark. We added specialty coating and finishing capabilities with this acquisition, particularly in luxury packaging and technical products. The results of operations and assets related to FiberMark are reflected in each of our business segments. These mills are located in Brattleboro, Vermont, Brownville and Lowville, New York, Quakertown, Pennsylvania and Bolton, England. On December 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of certain equipment, inventory, real property and other specified assets relating to the Company’s premium fine paper and office products manufacturing facility located in Brattleboro, Vermont. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Sale of Brattleboro Mill and Impairment Loss."
One of the two fine paper machines of the Fox River acquisition located in Appleton, Wisconsin (noted above) was converted to produce filtration products as part of NFA. This business began operations in 2017.

Business Strategy
Our mission is to create value by improving the image and performance of everything we touch. We expect to create value by growing in specialized niche markets that value performance or image and where we have competitive advantages. In managing our businesses, we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets, responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges, employing capital optimally, controlling costs, and managing risks are important to our long-term success. Strategies to deliver value include:
Enhance our leading positions in high value core categories — We will increase our participation in niche markets that can provide us with leading positions and value our core competencies in performance-based fiber and non-woven media production, coating and saturating. Key markets include transportation filtration, specialty backings and technical products, and premium fine paper and packaging.
Increasing our size, growth rate and portfolio diversification — We will invest and focus resources in higher growth specialty markets such as filtration, digital image transfer, and premium packaging, to grow with customers in new products and geographies and to enter into adjacent markets that are growing and profitable. We will do this both through organic initiatives that build on our technologies and capabilities, and through acquisitions that fit with our competencies and provide attractive financial returns.
Delivering consistent, attractive returns to our shareholders — We will continue to use Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") as a key metric to evaluate investment decisions and measure our performance, and will also maintain a prudent capital structure and deploy cash flows in ways that can provide value, including direct cash returns to shareholders through a meaningful dividend.

Markets and Customers
Technical Products.    The technical products business sells its products globally to other manufacturers who convert our product for sale into product categories generally used as base materials in the following applications: filtration, component backing materials for manufactured products such as tape and abrasives, and other specialized product uses such as graphics and identification.
Several products (filtration media, abrasives, specialty tapes, labels) are used in markets that are directly affected by economic business cycles. Other market segments such as image transfer papers used in small/home office and consumer applications are relatively stable. Most products are performance-based and require qualification by customers; however, certain categories may also be subject to price competition and the substitution of lower cost substrates in some less demanding applications.
The technical products business relies on a team of direct sales representatives and customer service representatives to market and sell a large majority of its sales volume directly to customers and converters.
The technical products business has more than 500 customers worldwide. The distribution of sales in 2018 was approximately 42 percent in Europe, 37 percent in North America, and 21 percent in Latin America and Asia. Customers typically convert and transform base papers and film into finished rolls and sheets by adding adhesives, coatings, and finishes. These transformed products are then sold to end-users.
5

Sales to the technical products business' three largest customers combined represented approximately 13 percent of total sales for the segment in 2018. Although a complete loss of any of these customers would cause a temporary decline in the business' sales volume, the decline could be partially offset by expanding sales to existing customers, and further offset over a several month period with the addition of new customers.
Fine Paper and Packaging.    Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium writing, text and cover papers, bright papers and specialty papers in North America. These products are used in high-end collateral material, business and legal professions, and corporate identity products. Our premium packaging business includes products such as food and beverage labels and high-end packaging materials such as folding cartons and box wrap used for luxury retail goods. Bright papers are generally used by consumers for flyers, direct mail and packaging.
The fine paper and packaging business sells its products in a variety of channels including authorized paper distributors, converters, retailers, and direct to end users. Sales to distributors account for approximately 60 percent of revenue in the fine paper and packaging business. During 2018, approximately 10 percent of the sales of our fine paper and packaging business were exported to markets outside the United States.
Sales to the two largest customers of the fine paper and packaging business represented approximately 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of its total sales in 2018. We practice limited sales distribution to improve our ability to control the marketing of our products. Although a complete loss of these customers would cause a temporary decline in the business's sales volume, the decline could be partially offset by expanding sales to existing customers, and further offset over a several month period with the addition of new customers.
Concentration.    For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to CNG and Veritiv represented approximately 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of consolidated net sales, and approximately 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Veritiv and CNG each represented approximately 7 percent of consolidated net sales and approximately 15 percent of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 sales to Veritiv represented approximately 8 percent of consolidated net sales and approximately 15 percent of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business.

See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Business Segment and Geographic Information", for information with respect to net sales, operating income and long-lived assets by business segment and location.
Raw Materials
Technical Products.    Softwood pulp, specialty pulps and fibers, and latex are the primary raw materials consumed by our technical products business. The technical products business purchases softwood pulp, specialty pulp and fibers, and latex from various external suppliers. We believe that all of the raw materials for our technical products operations, except for certain specialty latex grades and specialty pulps, are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations.
Our technical products business acquires all of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers. In general, these supply arrangements are covered by formal contracts, and represent multi-year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs. We expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future. In the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier, we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short-term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex. In the event of a long-term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex, we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production. As a result, we do not believe that the substitution of such alternative pulp or latex grades would have a material effect on our operations.
Fine Paper and Packaging.    Hardwood pulp is the primary raw material used to produce products of the fine paper and packaging business. Other significant raw material inputs in the production of fine paper and packaging products include softwood pulp, recycled fiber, cotton fiber, dyes and fillers. The fine paper and packaging business purchases all of its raw materials externally. We believe that all of the raw materials for our fine paper and packaging operations are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations.
Energy and Water
The equipment used to manufacture the products of our technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas, oil and coal. We generate substantially all of our electrical energy at the Munising mill and approximately 25 percent of the electrical energy at our mills in Appleton, Wisconsin and Bruckmühl, Germany. We also purchase electrical energy from external sources, including electricity generated from renewable sources.
Availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future, but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on changes in demand and other factors.
An adequate supply of water is needed to manufacture our products. We believe that there is an adequate supply of water for this purpose at each of our manufacturing locations.
Working Capital
Technical Products.    The technical products business maintains approximately 25 to 30 days of raw materials and supplies inventories to support its manufacturing operations and approximately 25 to 35 days of finished goods and semi-finished goods inventory to support customer orders for its products. Sales terms in the technical products business vary depending on the type of product sold and customer category. Extended credit terms of up to 120 days are offered to customers located in certain international markets. In general, sales are collected in approximately 45 to 55 days and supplier invoices are paid within 20 to 30 days.
Fine Paper and Packaging.    The fine paper and packaging business maintains approximately 10 days of raw material inventories to support its paper making operations and about 55 days of finished goods inventory to fill customer orders. 
8

Fine paper and packaging sales terms range between 20 and 30 days with discounts of 0 to 2 percent for customer payments, with discounts of 1 percent and 20-day terms used most often. Extended credit terms are offered to customers located in certain international markets. Supplier invoices are typically paid within 60 days.
Competition
Technical Products.    Our technical products business competes in global markets with a number of large multinational competitors, including Ahlstrom-Munksjö, ArjoWiggins SAS and Hollingsworth & Vose Company. It also competes in some, but not all, of these segments with smaller regional manufacturers, such as Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc., Potsdam Specialty Paper, Inc. and Paper Line S.p.A. We believe the basis of competition in most of these segments are the ability to design and develop customized product features to meet customer performance specifications while maintaining quality, customer service and price. We believe our research and development program gives us an advantage in customizing base papers and developing advanced filter media to meet customer needs.
Fine Paper and Packaging.    Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing and other high-end specialty papers in North America. Our fine paper and packaging business also competes in the premium segment of the uncoated free sheet market. The fine paper and packaging business competes directly in North America with Mohawk Fine Paper Inc. and other smaller companies. We believe the primary basis of competition for premium fine papers are brand recognition, product quality, customer service, product availability, promotional support and variety of colors and textures. Price also can be a factor particularly for lower quality printing needs that may compete with opaque and offset papers. We have and will continue to invest in advertising and other programs aimed at graphic designers, printers and corporate end-users in order to maintain a high level of brand awareness as well as communicate the advantages of using our products. 
Our premium packaging business is focused on high-end packaging needs in end market verticals like beauty products, spirits and retail. Primary bases of competition are similarly brand recognition, product quality, customer service, product availability, and a variety of colors and textures. Premium packaging is primarily a North American business, but we also sell to customers in Asia and other markets outside the U.S. We believe the premium packaging market to be highly fragmented, with multiple competitors, many of which produce premium packaging products as a small subset of larger packaging operations.
Research and Development
Our technical products business maintains research and development laboratories in Feldkirchen-Westerham, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Munising, Michigan and Pittsfield, Massachusetts to support its strategy of developing new products and technologies, and to support growth in its existing product lines and other strategically important markets. We also have a research and development laboratory in West Springfield, Massachusetts that supports both our technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses. We have continually invested in product research and development with spending of $9.2 million in 2018, $8.9 million in 2017 and $9.4 million in 2016.
Intellectual Property
We own more than 100 granted patents and have multiple pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Europe and certain other countries covering image transfer paper, abrasives and medical packaging, and other paper application and media processing. We also own more than 150 trademarks with registrations in approximately 80 countries. Our image transfer patents have contributed to establishing the technical products business as a leading global supplier of image transfer papers through our highly recognized JET-PRO®, 3G JET-OPAQUE®, TECHNIPRINT®, LASER-ONE OPAQUE® and IMAGE CLIP® brands. We add even more depth and strength to our technical products portfolio with the well-recognized dye-sublimation and digital decor JETCOL® and DIGICOL® brands, which are also supported by patented technology. The KIMDURA® and MUNISING LP® trademarks have also made a significant contribution to the marketing of synthetic film and clean room papers of our technical products business.
For more than 100 years, Neenah’s fine paper and packaging business has built its market leading reputation on creating and manufacturing trademarked brands for premium writing, text, cover, digital, packaging, and specialty needs. The Neenah signature portfolio includes innovative, market leading brands such as CLASSIC® (including CLASSIC 
9

CREST®, CLASSIC® Linen, CLASSIC® Laid, CLASSIC COLUMNS®, CLASSIC® Stipple, CLASSIC® Woodgrain, and CLASSIC® Techweave), ASTROBRIGHTS®, ENVIRONMENT®, The Design Collection, ROYAL SUNDANCE®, SOUTHWORTH® and many more. Our fine paper and packaging business provides unique and sustainable packaging papers, as well as custom solutions for premium packaging needs. With brands that stand for quality and consistency, such as NEENAH® Folding Board, NEENAH® Box Wrap, ESTATE LABEL®, and NEENAH IMAGEMAX® Paper Card, our fine paper and packaging business enables leading brands to deliver on their promise. The business also maintains a well-rounded and respected portfolio of brands that position Neenah as an industry leader, setting standards for quality, consistency, and dependability.
Neenah also boasts trademarks recognized in both the publishing and packaging markets, including SKIVERTEX® and KIVAR®. 
Finally, the GESSNER® trademark has played an important role in the marketing of Neenah’s filtration product lines. With the expansion of our newest filtration facility in Appleton, Wisconsin, Neenah expects increased recognition of this brand domestically and internationally.
Backlog and Seasonality
Technical Products.    In general, sales and operating income for the technical products business have been relatively stronger in the first half of the year with reductions in the third quarter due to reduced customer converting schedules and in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in year-end inventory levels by our customers. The order flow for the technical products business is subject to seasonal peaks for several of its products, such as the larger volume grades of specialty tape, abrasives, premask, and label stock used primarily in the downstream finished goods manufacturing process. To assure timely shipments during these seasonal peaks, the technical products business provides certain customers with finished goods inventory on consignment. The technical products business periodically experiences periods where order entry levels surge, and order backlogs can increase substantially. Raw materials are purchased and manufacturing schedules are planned based on customer forecasts, current market conditions and individual orders for custom products. The order backlog in the technical products business on December 31, 2018 was approximately $119.1 million and represented approximately 21 percent of current year sales. The order backlog in the technical products business on December 31, 2017 was approximately $122.1 million and represented approximately 24 percent of prior year sales. We previously filled the order backlog from December 31, 2017 and expect to fill the order backlog from December 31, 2018 within the next year.
Fine Paper and Packaging.    The fine paper and packaging business has historically not experienced seasonality. Orders for stock products are typically shipped within two days, while custom orders are shipped within two to three weeks of receipt. Raw material purchases and manufacturing schedules are planned based on a combination of historical trends, customer forecasts and current market conditions. The order backlogs in the fine paper and packaging business on December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $17.6 million and $19.9 million, respectively, which represent approximately 14 -15 days of sales. The order backlogs from December 31, 2018 and 2017 were filled in the respective following years.
The operating results for each of our businesses are influenced by the timing of our annual maintenance downs, which are generally scheduled in the third quarter.
Employee and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,641 regular full-time employees of whom 1,180 hourly and 580 salaried employees were located in the United States and 434 hourly and 447 salaried employees were located in Europe.
Approximately 50 percent of salaried employees and 80 percent of hourly employees of Neenah Germany are eligible to be represented by the Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union, Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie and Energie (the "IG BCE"). The IG BCE and a national trade association representing all employers in the industry signed a collective bargaining agreement covering union employees of Neenah Germany that expires at the end of February 2019. Under German law union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company. As a result, the number of employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement with the IG BCE that expires in February 2019 cannot be determined. The negotiations for a new collective bargaining arrangement between the national trade association and IG BCE are currently in progress. Until a new agreement is signed, the current agreement will apply.
10

As of December 31, 2018, 113 employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire in the next 12 months, not including the employees covered by the collective bargaining arrangement with the IG BCE. We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and do not expect the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements to have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Contingencies and Legal Matters — Employees and Labor Relations."
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. We believe our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. Except for certain orders issued by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies with which we believe we are in compliance and which we believe are immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, we are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters.
Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. In addition to certain federal proposals in the United States to regulate GHG emissions, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and all the states in which we operate are currently considering GHG legislation or regulations, either individually and/or as part of regional initiatives. While not all are likely to become law it is reasonably possible that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of such compliance.
While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new legislation to limit GHG emissions or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Our anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
