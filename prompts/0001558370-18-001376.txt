     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     Overview
     Penn National Gaming, Inc. (“Penn”) and together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our”or “us”) is a leading, geographically diversified, multi‑jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing facilities and video gaming terminal operations with a focus on slot machine entertainment. The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp. and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a publicly traded company. In 1997, we began our transition from a pari‑mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions, greenfield projects, and property expansions.  For example, in 2015, we opened Plainridge Park Casino, an integrated racing and slots-only gaming facility in Plainville, Massachusetts in June, completed the acquisition of our first Las Vegas strip asset, Tropicana Hotel and Casino (“Tropicana Las Vegas”) in Las Vegas, Nevada in August, and acquired Illinois Gaming Investors LLC (d/b/a Prairie State Gaming, (“Prairie State Gaming”) one of the largest video gaming terminal route operators in Illinois, in September.
     In 2016, our subsidiary, Prairie State Gaming, acquired two small video gaming terminal route operators in Illinois.  We have also recently implemented our interactive gaming strategy through our subsidiary, Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC (“Penn Interactive Ventures”) which included launching our HollywoodCasino.com Play4Fun social gaming platform with Scientific Games and on August 1, 2016, we enhanced our social gaming offerings with the acquisition of Rocket Speed, Inc. (“Rocket Speed”)), a leading developer of social casino games.  On May 1, 2017, we completed our acquisition of 1st Jackpot Casino Tunica (formerly known as Bally’s Casino Tunica, (“1st Jackpot”)) and Resorts Casino Tunica (“Resorts”).  In the first half of 2017, our subsidiary, Prairie State Gaming acquired the assets of two additional smaller video gaming terminal operators in Illinois. 
     Anticipated Acquisition of Pinnacle
     On December 17, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc., a leading regional gaming operator.  This transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of 2018 (subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions to closing), is expected to add eleven more properties to our holdings and to provide greater operational scale and geographic diversity. 
     We believe that our portfolio of assets provides us the benefit of a geographically diversified cash flow from operations. We expect to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets. 
     In this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Penn” refer to Penn National Gaming, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
     Master Lease
     On November 1, 2013, the Company completed its plan to separate its gaming operating assets from its real property assets by creating a newly formed, publicly traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”), known as Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), through a tax free spin‑off (the “Spin‑Off”).
    
 
  5

 

 As a result of the Spin‑Off, GLPI owns substantially all of Penn’s former real property assets as of such date and leases back those assets (other than Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, the “TRS Properties”) to Penn for use by its subsidiaries, under a “triple net” master lease agreement (the “Master Lease”) (which has a fifteen‑year initial term that can be extended at Penn’s option for up to four five‑year renewal terms). Penn continues to operate the leased gaming facilities and holds the gaming licenses associated with these facilities.  The TRS Properties were transferred to GLPI in connection with the Spin-Off and the financial results from these properties were included in discontinued operations for 2013.
     As of December 31, 2017, the Company leased from GLPI real property assets associated with twenty of the Company’s gaming and related facilities used in the Company’s operations. The following summary of the Master Lease is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Lease and subsequent amendments, each of which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It was determined that the Master Lease did not meet the requirements of a normal leaseback under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840 “Leases” due to prohibited forms of continuing involvement and is therefore accounted for as a financing obligation.
     The payment structure under the Master Lease, which became effective November 1, 2013, includes a fixed component, a portion of which is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2% if certain coverage ratio thresholds are met, and a component that is based on the performance of the facilities, which is prospectively adjusted, subject to a floor of zero (i) every five years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change to net revenues of all facilities under the Master Lease (other than Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo) during the preceding five years, and (ii) monthly by an amount equal to 20% of the change in net revenues of Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo during the preceding month. In addition, with the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course in the third quarter of 2014, our annual payment related to the Master Lease increased by approximately $19 million, which approximates 10% of the real estate construction costs paid for by GLPI related to these facilities.
     In April 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Master Lease in order to revise certain provisions relating to our Sioux City property. In accordance with that amendment, upon the cessation of gaming operations at Argosy Casino Sioux City on July 30, 2014, due to the termination of its gaming license, the annual payment to GLPI was reduced by $6.2 million.
     On May 1, 2017, following the acquisition of RIH Acquisitions MS I, LLC and RIH Acquisitions MS II, LLC, the holding companies for the gaming operations of 1st Jackpot and Resorts in Tunica, Mississippi, an amendment to the Master Lease was entered into in order to add the two additional facilities. The Company is operating both of these casino properties and it leases the underlying real estate associated with these two businesses from GLPI with a total initial annual payment of $9.0 million subject to the provisions included in the terms of the Master Lease. The transaction increased the Company’s Master Lease financing obligation by $82.6 million on the acquisition date, which represents the purchase price GLPI paid for the underlying real estate assets.
     The Master Lease is commonly known as a triple‑net lease. Accordingly, in addition to financing obligation payments, the Company is required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.
     At the Company’s option, the Master Lease may be extended for up to four five‑year renewal terms beyond the initial fifteen‑year term, on the same terms and conditions. If we elect to renew the term of the Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Master Lease, provided that the final renewal option shall only be exercisable with respect to certain of the barge‑based facilities—i.e., facilities where barges serve as foundations upon which buildings are constructed to serve as gaming or related facilities or serve ancillary purposes such as access platforms or shear barges to protect a gaming facility from floating debris—following 

 
  6

 
an independent third party expert’s review of the total useful life of the applicable barged‑based facility measured from the beginning of the initial term. If the final five‑year renewal term would not cause the aggregate term to exceed 80% of the useful life of such facility, the facility shall be included in the five‑year renewal. In the event that a five‑year renewal of such facility would cause it to exceed 80% of the estimated useful life, such facility shall be included in the renewal for the period of time equal to but not exceeding 80% of the estimated useful life.
     We do not have the ability to terminate our obligations under the Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI’s consent. If the Master Lease is terminated prior to its expiration other than with GLPI’s consent, we may be liable for damages and incur charges such as continued lease payments through the end of the lease term and maintenance costs for the leased property.
     Segment Information
     The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), as that term is defined in ASC 280 “Segment Reporting”, measures and assesses the Company’s business performance based on regional operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic locations.     The Northeast reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Casino Toledo, Hollywood Casino Columbus, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, and Plainridge Park Casino.  It also includes the Company’s Casino Rama management service contract.
     The South/West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino, Hollywood Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast, Boomtown Biloxi, M Resort, Tropicana Las Vegas, 1st Jackpot and Resorts which were acquired on May 1, 2017, as well as our management contract with Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego.  In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May.     The Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, and Prairie State Gaming, which the Company acquired on September 1, 2015, and includes the Company’s 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, LLC (“Kansas Entertainment”), which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway. 
     The Other category consists of the Company’s standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, which was sold on July 31, 2016, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company’s joint venture interests in Sam Houston Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company’s regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment. The Other category also includes the Company’s corporate overhead operations, which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280. Additionally, the Other category includes Penn Interactive Ventures, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary that represents its social online gaming initiatives, including Rocket Speed. Penn Interactive Ventures meets the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280, but is quantitatively not significant to the Company’s operations as it represents less than 2% of net revenues and 5% of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its total assets represent less than 2% of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2017.
     In addition to GAAP financial measures, management uses adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel and believes it is especially relevant in evaluating large, long lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such 

 
  7

 
projects. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock compensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with the Company’s share of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) added back for its joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments associated with our Master Lease agreement with GLPI as the transaction is accounted for as a financing obligation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to income from operations, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA.
     See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to the Company’s segments.

In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May.     Midwest Properties

     Competition
     The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of operators, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land‑based casinos, video lottery, video gaming terminals (VGTs) at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet and fantasy sports gaming, the potential for increased sports betting and other forms of gaming in the U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; athletic events; television and movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and First Nations in Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Maryland), have legalized and expanded or have plans to license additional gaming facilities, video gaming terminals and other gaming offerings in the near future. In addition, more gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other companies will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Finally, the imposition of smoking bans and/or higher gaming tax rates have a significant impact on our properties’ ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions.
     Our racing operations face significant competition for wagering dollars from other racetracks and off-track wagering facilities (“OTWs”), some of which also offer other forms of gaming, as well as other gaming venues such as casinos and historic racing. Additionally, for a number of years, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives and unwillingness of customers to travel a significant distance to racetracks. Our account wagering operations compete with large providers of such services throughout the country. We also face competition in the future from new OTWs, new racetracks, historic racing, or new providers of account wagering. From time to time, states consider legislation to permit other forms of gaming. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing operations, such gaming opportunities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Northeast. Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by competition in the Baltimore, Maryland market, which includes Maryland Live! and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore. Maryland Live!, a casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland, opened in June 2012 and  Horseshoe Casino Baltimore opened at the end of August 2014. Both of these facilities are substantial in nature, as Maryland Live! Has approximately 4,000 slot machines, over 200 table games and various food and beverage offerings whereas Horseshoe Baltimore has 2,200 slot machines and 180 table games.  In December 2013, the sixth casino license for Maryland in Prince George’s County was granted to MGM. In December 2016, MGM National Harbor casino and resort opened featuring 3,300 slot machines and 124 table games and has had an adverse impact our financial results, as it has created additional competition for Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races.
     In November 2011, the Expanded Gaming Act was signed into law in Massachusetts, which allows up to three destination resort casinos located in three geographically diverse regions across the state and a single slots facility for one location statewide. In February 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission awarded us the slots‑only gaming license and in June 2015, we opened Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville. The licenses for two of three casino resorts have been awarded with the remaining license in Southeastern Massachusetts still open. MGM Springfield in Western Massachusetts is expected to be completed in September 2018 and Wynn Everett in the Boston Area is scheduled to open in mid-2019. Construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts, which was expected to open in 2017, is currently on hold following a judicial opinion issued during the third quarter of 2016 regarding the validity of the Tribe’s land in trust. In addition, a proposal to relocate the Newport Casino license to Tiverton, Rhode Island, near the Massachusetts border, was approved by local and statewide voters in November 2016. The proposal calls for a $75 million casino featuring 1,000 slot machines, 32 table games and an 84 room hotel.  The increased competition in 

 
  17

 
Massachusetts will have a negative impact on the operations of Plainridge Park Casino; however, we anticipate that it will be the sole gaming facility in Massachusetts until at the least third quarter of 2018.
     In Ohio, voters passed a referendum in 2009 to allow four land‑based casinos in four cities, one of which was in downtown Cincinnati, which is the primary feeder market for our Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg property. The Cincinnati casino opened in March 2013 and has had and will likely continue to have an adverse impact on Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. However, this referendum also resulted in the Company operating two of the four land‑based casinos. We opened Hollywood Casino Toledo in May 2012 and Hollywood Casino Columbus in October 2012. Additionally, the State of Ohio approved the placement of video lottery terminals at the state’s seven racetracks. In June 2012, a new racino at Scioto Downs in Columbus, Ohio opened, which has had a negative impact on Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg’s financial results and competes aggressively in the same market as Hollywood Casino Columbus. In addition, a racino at Miami Valley Gaming opened in mid‑December 2013, and a racino at Belterra Park opened in May 2014. Both of these racinos compete with Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. Conversely, we have opened our own racinos in Ohio, with Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway opening in August 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course opening in September 2014. As a result, in a relatively short period of time, Ohio has gone from having no gaming facilities to having four casinos and seven video lottery terminal facilities. In addition, we continue to fight illegal gaming operations, such as internet sweepstakes.
     In addition, legislators in Kentucky regularly consider new gaming legislation. The commencement of gaming in Kentucky would negatively impact certain of our existing properties in the Northeast segment. In October 2017, Pennsylvania enacted gaming expansion legislation that authorized licenses for up to ten new category 4 satellite casinos, VGTs at truck stops, online gaming, and other gaming offerings.  The new casinos will have the ability to operate between 300 and 750 slot machines and between 30 and 40 table games.  Only Pennsylvania’s existing gaming operators may initially participate in the auctions for these new casinos, with a preference given to the category 1 and category 2 license holders in the first round ending July 31, 2018.  On January 10, 2018, Penn was awarded the first category 4 satellite casino license to be located in York County, which will compete with our Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course facility. On February 8, 2018, the third category 4 satellite casino license was awarded in Lawrence County which is expected to compete with and have an adverse impact on our existing Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course facility in Austintown, Ohio.  On February 22, 2018, the fourth category 4 satellite casino license was awarded in Cumberland County which is expected to compete with and have an adverse impact on our Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course facility in Grantville, Pennsylvania.  Depending on how many of the ten satellite casino licenses are ultimately issued, and the final locations, size and scope of these satellite casinos, and the impact of VGT’s at truck stops and online gaming offerings, there may be additional negative impacts on our existing facilities in the Northeast segment.
     South/West. Our South/West segment contains our M Resort and Tropicana Las Vegas properties and Hollywood Casino Jamul- San Diego, which we operate under our management contract with the Jamul Tribe. M Resort and Tropicana Las Vegas compete directly with other Las Vegas hotels, resorts, and casinos, including those located on the Las Vegas Strip, on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment offered, convention and meeting facilities, shopping and restaurant facilities, theme, and size. In addition, a substantial number of customers are drawn from geographic areas outside of Las Vegas, particularly California and Arizona. Specifically, in California, we expect Hollywood Casino Jamul – San Diego to continue to experience significant competition from nearby casinos operated on Native American lands, which could negatively impact their results as well as the Las Vegas market.  In the Mississippi Gulf Coast market, a casino in D’Iberville, Mississippi opened in December 2015, which has had an adverse effect on the financial results of our Boomtown Biloxi property.
     Midwest. In Illinois, there have been perennial gaming expansion proposals introduced in the legislature, which we expect to continue.  In October 2012, video gambling in Illinois was officially launched with the first locations being allowed to operate VGTs. Currently, there are over 22,000 terminals at numerous locations throughout the state, which has had a negative impact on our casinos near or in Illinois. In September 2015, we purchased Prairie State Gaming, which is a licensed VGT operator in Illinois, whose operations now include more than 1,700 video gaming terminals. 

 
  18

 
Illinois also continues to discuss the viability of gaming expansion in the state through a potential combination of additional riverboat operations, land-based casinos and slots at racetracks.  In addition, legislators in Indiana and Missouri are currently considering VGT legislation. The commencement of gaming in Indiana and Missouri or the expansion of gaming in Illinois would negatively impact certain of our existing properties in the Midwest segment.  In addition, there is a proposal to reopen a race track with slot machines at the Woodlands in Wyandotte County, which could have an adverse effect on the financial results of Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway.
         U.S. and Foreign Revenues
     Our net revenues in the U.S. for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately $3,136.4 million, $3,023.2 million, and $2,828.1 million, respectively. Our revenues from operations in Canada for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately $11.6 million, $11.2 million, and $10.3 million, respectively.
