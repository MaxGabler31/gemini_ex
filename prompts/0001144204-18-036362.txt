The Group is a manufacturer utilized by many well-known brands and retailers, such as Walmart, Costco, Sears, Hanes, Columbia, Land’s End, VF Corporation (which owns brands such as The North Face, Nautica, Timberland, Wrangler, Lee, Jansport, etc.), and Philip-Van Heusen (which owns brands such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, IZOD, Speedo, etc.). The Group’s production facilities are made up of three factory units and two warehouses and employ currently approximately 2,900 people.

Merger
 
Jerash Holdings is a holding company organized in Delaware in January 2016 with nominal or no assets or operations. On May 11, 2017, a merger (“the Merger”) was implemented via two transactions, the first being an equity contribution whereby the shareholders of Global Trend International Limited (“Global Trend”) contributed 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Global Trend to Jerash Holdings in exchange for an aggregate of 8,787,500 shares of the common stock of Jerash Holdings, with Global Trend becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Holdings. In the second transaction, Global Trend merged with and into Jerash Holdings, with Jerash Holdings being the surviving entity, as a result of which Jerash Holdings became the direct parent of Global Trend’s wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Jerash Garments and Fashions Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (“Jerash Garments”) and Treasure Success International Limited (“Treasure Success”).

In 2015, we commenced a project to build a 450 square meter workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which will primarily be used as a sewing workshop for Jerash Garments. This project is expected to cost approximately $230,000 to construct and is estimated to be completed during calendar year 2018. In 2018, the Group commenced another project to build a 5,000 square meter workshop in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which is expected to be completed by the middle of calendar year 2019. Provided that we satisfy certain employment requirements over certain time periods, we do not anticipate incurring any significant costs for the project, which is being constructed in conjunction with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Jordanian Education and Training Department. In the event we breach our agreement with these government agencies, we will have to pay such agencies 250,000 Jordanian Dinar (“JOD”) or $353,000. See Item 2. Properties below for more information regarding this workshop.
 
Total annual capacity at the Group’s existing facilities is approximately 6.5 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polos and jackets). Our production flow begins in the Group’s third factory unit in the cutting department. From there, the product moves to either the Group’s first or second factory unit for processing by the sewing unit, finishing department, quality control, and finally the ironing and packing units. If applicable during this process, the product is sent back to the embroidery department at the Group’s third factory unit for embroidery.
 
The Group does not have long term supply contracts or arrangements with our suppliers. Most of the Group’s ultimate suppliers for raw materials, such as fabric, zippers and labels, are designated by customers and the Group purchases such materials on a purchase order basis.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, the Group had an aggregate of approximately 2,700 employees located in Jordan and in Hong Kong, all of which are full-time employees.

(1) Substantially all of the Group’s products are sold under The North Face brand that is owned by VF Corporation.
 
(2) Until August 2016, substantially all of our sales were to Ford Glory International Limited (“Ford Glory”) which then sold the products to the end customers. Ford Glory is 49% owned by Mr. Choi Lin Hung, our chairman, chief executive officer, president and a significant stockholder, through his wholly owned entity Merlotte Enterprise Limited (“Merlotte”) and therefore is considered an affiliate of the Group. Following August 1, 2016, there was a transition period for orders placed directly with Ford Glory during the remainder of fiscal 2017. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, approximately 37.6% and 0%, respectively, of our net sales were made to Ford Glory and approximately 52.6% and 63.5% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively, were made directly to our customers with support of Ford Glory. During fiscal 2017, for sales orders received before customers successfully changed their vendor registrations to issue orders directly to us, we fulfilled the order for customers on behalf of Ford Glory, including inventory purchases and manufacturing. As customers now issue sales orders to us directly, support from Ford Glory was phased out during fiscal 2018 as we no longer rely on Ford Glory to receive sales orders. Our merchandising personnel now receive orders directly from our customers through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Treasure Success and Jerash Garments.
 
In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Group depended on one key customer for sales through Ford Glory. In fiscal 2018, the Group also depended on a few key customers. Substantially all of the Group’s sales through Ford Glory in fiscal 2016 and 2017, and independent of Ford Glory in 2018, were to VF Corporation. The following table outlines the dollar amount and percentage of the Group’s sales through Ford Glory for fiscal years 2016 to 2018.

(1) Substantially all of the Group’s products are sold under The North Face brand that is owned by VF Corporation.
 
The Group established our relationship with VF Corporation in 2012. Substantially all of the Group’s products are sold under The North Face Brand that is owned by VF Corporation. Currently, we manufacture primarily outwear for The North Face. Approximately 79% of the Group’s sales in both fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the sale of the Group’s products to VF Corporation. We are not party to any long-term contracts with VF Corporation or the Group’s other customers, and our sales arrangements with our customers do not have minimum purchase requirements. As is common in our industry, VF Corporation and our other customers place purchase orders with us after the Group completes detailed sample development and approval processes that we and our customers have agreed upon for their purchase and manufacture of the garments in question. It is through the sample development and approval processes that the Group and VF Corporation and our other customers agree to the purchase and manufacture of the garments in question. For fiscal 2018, VF Corporation issued approximately 6,500 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $10 to $570,000. The Group is not substantially dependent on any particular order from VF Corporation.
 
VF Corporation is in the retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations. Consequently, there can be no assurance that sales to current customers will continue at the current rate or at all. In addition, our annual and quarterly results may vary, which may cause our profits and the market price of our common stock to decline.
 
The Group continues to seek to expand and strengthen our relationship with our current customers and other brand names. However, the Group cannot assure you that these brands will continue to buy our products in the same volumes or on the same terms as they did in the past.
 
Competition
 
The markets for the manufacturing of sport and outerwear are highly competitive. The competition in the fields in which the Group operates is focused primarily on the price of the product, its quality, and the level of customer service. Our products compete with products of other apparel manufacturers in Israel, Europe, the United States, South and Central America and Asia.

Most competition with other manufacturers in the clothing industry focuses on reducing production costs, reducing supply lead times, design, product quality, and efficiency of supply to the customer. Since production costs depend to a large extent on labor costs, in recent years most production in the industry has been moved to countries where the labor costs are low.  Some of the Group’s competitors have a lower cost base, longer operating experience, broader customer base and other advantages over us which allow them to compete with us. As described in more detail under “- Conditions in Jordan” below, the Group is able to sell our products manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the United States free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions. These favorable terms enable us to remain competitive on the basis of price. In December 2017, the European Union (“EU”) extended a free trade agreement to us such that goods manufactured by us in Jordan that are subsequently shipped to EU countries are shipped free of duty.
 
Conditions in Jordan
 
The Group’s manufacturing facilities are located in Jordan. Accordingly, the Group is directly affected by political, security and economic conditions in Jordan.
 
From time to time Jordan has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Syria and Israel. A peace agreement between Israel and Jordan was signed in 1994. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the Jordanian economy and the Group’s operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within Jordan more difficult and less desirable. Political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Jordanian operations involve a high degree of risk, which could adversely affect the market and price for the Group’s common stock.
 
Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the King holds wide executive and legislative powers. The ruling family has taken initiatives that support the economic growth of the country. However, there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful or will continue. The rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting manufacturing companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investments in Jordan could change as well.
 
A proposed tax bill that was part of an economic reform plan backed by the International Monetary Fund and aimed at narrowing Jordan’s growing debt contained new taxes on products, such as internet subscriptions, and the elimination of subsidies on bread led to protests throughout Jordan beginning on May 30, 2018. On June 5, 2018, King Abdullah II of Jordan responded to the protests by removing Jordan’s prime minister and replacing him with Omar al-Razzaz. Prime Minister Razzaz then withdrew the proposed tax bill from consideration and formed a new cabinet. On June 11, 2018 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates pledged $2.5 billion of aid to Jordan (including a deposit into Jordan’s central bank), annual budget support for the next five years and development projects.
 
Trade Agreements
 
The Group benefits from exemptions from customs duties and import quotas due to the Group’s location in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, a QIZ in Amman, Jordan, and the free trade agreements with the United States and the EU.
 
QIZs are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan and Egypt. They are special free trade zones established in collaboration with Israel to take advantage of the free trade agreements between the United States and Israel. Under the trade agreement between Jordan and the U.S., goods produced in QIZ areas can directly access U.S. markets without tariff or quota restrictions if they satisfy certain criteria.

Income Tax Incentives
 
The Encouragement of Investment Committee of Jordan resolved that Jerash Garments’ project is an economically approved project in accordance with the Encouragement of Investment Law number 16 of 1995 and accordingly was granted exemptions from customs duties on the plant’s equipment and machinery. Further, in accordance with the Jordanian Income Tax law, all of Jerash Garments’ exports are 100% exempted, provided a specific Declaration in that respect is filed with the Jordanian Customs and Income Tax Departments. We expect these exemptions to continue through calendar 2019.
 
In addition, projects in QIZ areas are exempted from paying income and social services tax, total exemptions from buildings and land tax, and exemptions or reduction on most municipality fees.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Group’s manufacturing and other facilities in Jordan are subject to various local regulations relating to the maintenance of safe working conditions and manufacturing practices. Management believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with all such regulations. The Group is not subject to governmental approval of the Group’s products or manufacturing process.
