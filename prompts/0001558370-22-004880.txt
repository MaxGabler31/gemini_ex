Item 1. Business.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General Development of Business
Retractable Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Texas in 1994. Our business is the manufacturing and marketing of safety medical products (predominately syringes) for the healthcare industry. We have manufacturing facilities in Little Elm, Texas and use manufacturers in China as well. Our syringes are well-suited for administering vaccinations and our revenues for 2021 materially increased over prior years due to demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 and 2021, we increased our revenues by 95.9% and 130.1%, respectively, over the prior years. Our $59.4 million revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 represent an 85.8% increase over the same quarter in the prior year and a 94.7% increase in units sold. Our principal customer was the U.S. government which purchased products representing 60.3% ($113.7 million) of our revenues in 2021. 
We increased our domestic production in 2020 and in 2021, primarily due to the increased demand brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting U.S. government delivery orders. We have been working to increase our manufacturing capacity in Little Elm, Texas, funded in part by the Technology Investment Agreement ("TIA") with the United States Government Department of Defense, U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division & Edgewood Contracting Division (ACC-APG, NCD & ECD) on behalf of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), as amended (“TIA”). The TIA, as amended, calls for $81.0 million in spending by the U.S. government to purchase additional manufacturing equipment, related ancillary equipment, and an increase in our production facility floorspace. At our own expense, we constructed a new warehouse onsite for housing finished goods and raw materials to be used in the manufacturing process. In addition, we have increased our workforce significantly to meet the increased production needs and to administer the expansion of our facilities and the increase in manufacturing equipment, as well as to provide support personnel. The expansion efforts represent a significant commitment in terms of financial and technical resources.
Description of Business
Our dominant revenue-generating products are our injection devices (syringes and needles). Such products are marketed under the VanishPoint®, Patient Safe®, and EasyPoint® brands. We have only one reporting segment. Most of our products incorporate a feature whereby our needles retract which is a safety feature designed to protect healthcare workers from needlestick injuries. Our VanishPoint® 1mL syringes meet the criteria set by pharmaceutical manufacturers for low dead space, which results in a reduction of wasted medication caused by residual medication remaining in the syringe after a dose has been administered. In some instances, the low dead space allows for additional doses to be obtained from a medication vial.

In 2021, the U.S. government was a significant customer due to efforts to vaccinate the U.S. population against COVID-19. On May 1, 2020, we received an order from the Department of Health and Human Services to supply certain automated safety syringes for $83.8 million, plus $10 million in expedited freight costs. The period of performance ended March 2022. In February 2021, we received a new contract from the Department of Health and Human Services for additional safety syringes. As amended, the contract represented a total of $147 million in revenues and freight costs plus additional reimbursable freight costs of $6 million. As of December 31, 2021, we recorded total sales of $113.7 million to the U.S. government, representing 60.3% of our overall revenues for 2021. 
During 2021, we also continued to provide products to our existing and new private healthcare customers. Our growth in sales in 2021 was predominantly driven by demand for syringes for COVID-19 vaccines and flu vaccines. 
Our goal is to become a leading provider of safety medical products. Our principal products were designed to protect healthcare workers, patients, and others from needlestick injuries, cross-contamination through reuse, and reduce disposal costs.
VanishPoint® syringe sales have historically comprised most of our sales. VanishPoint® syringe sales were 85.3%, 84.0%, and 93.6% of our revenues in 2019, 2020, and 2021. EasyPoint® products accounted for 5.1% of sales in 2021.
We currently have under development additional safety products that add to or build upon our current product line offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our primary focus over the last year has centered on providing existing products to meet demand related to COVID-19 vaccinations.
Our products are sold to and used by healthcare providers primarily in the U.S. (with 11.1% of revenues in 2021 generated from sales outside the U.S.).
In years not dominated by direct sales to the U.S. government, representatives of group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) and purchasing representatives (rather than the end-users of the product) make the vast majority of decisions relating to the purchase of medical supplies. The GPOs and larger manufacturers often enter into contracts which can prohibit or limit entry in the marketplace by competitors.
We distribute our products throughout the U.S. through general line and specialty distributors. We also use international distributors. We have developed a national direct marketing network in order to market our products to health care customers and their purchaser representatives.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our product components, including needle adhesives and packaging materials, are purchased from various suppliers. There is no current scarcity of such materials or such suppliers.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights, particularly patent rights, are material to our business. The patent rights are jointly owned by the Company and Thomas J. Shaw, our founder and CEO, and have varying expiration dates. Under the terms of an exclusive license agreement that has been in effect since 1995, the Company is exclusively licensed to use the patent rights held by Mr. Shaw, and Mr. Shaw generally receives a 5% royalty on gross sales of products subject to the license and he receives 50% of the royalties paid to the Company by certain sublicensees of the technology subject to the license.
Recent and expected modifications to our VanishPoint® syringes will effectively cause the modified VanishPoint® syringes products to have extended patent expiration dates. Following the expiration of patents related to the old design, competitors may attempt to copy aspects of such prior design, but not the current design. Patents related to recent modifications to the VanishPoint® syringes and core technology of the VanishPoint® syringes will expire during the years 2028 through 2032. Other patent applications covering inventions applicable to the VanishPoint® syringes are pending.
The Company has unexpired patents which relate to the EasyPoint® technology and other products as well.

The Company has registered the following trade names and trademarks for our products: VanishPoint®, EasyPoint®, Patient Safe®, VanishPoint® logos, RT and design, the VanishPoint® and design, the spot design and the Company slogans “The New Standard for Safety” ® and “We Make Safety Safe” ®.
Seasonality
Historically, unit sales have increased during the flu season. Seasonal trends have been less pronounced due to demand related to the COVID-19 vaccine.
Dependence on Customers
Although our business has historically derived significant percentages of its revenues from a few customers, we do not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. government was a significant customer from mid-2020 through the end of 2021 in connection with its purchase of syringes for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Government Contracts
In 2020, we entered into a material contract with the U.S. government providing a significant grant and accepted the $83.8 million order under an existing contract for the sale of syringes. In February 2021, we and the Department of Health and Human Services entered into a new contract, and it placed another material order with us for syringes. All such contracts may be terminated by the U.S. government but, given that the 2020 order has been filled and the 2021 orders are nearing completion, we do not believe termination (or renegotiation) is likely.
Government Approval and Government Regulations
Compliance with government regulations represents an important part of our business. As a manufacturer of medical devices and operating under the TIA, we are subject to stringent regulatory requirements. In addition, we are also subject to maintain systems to monitor and report our findings to various regulatory bodies. We are also subject to audit by those bodies and/or third parties acting as proxies to verify our compliance with such regulations. The cost of compliance can be significant in terms of financial and human resource commitments. These costs are ongoing and may become more significant if the regulatory landscape changes.
​
The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of our products are subject to government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Regulation by various international, federal and state agencies address the development and approval to market medical products, as well as approval and supervision of manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, distribution and record-keeping.
For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market, we have given notice of intent to market to the FDA, and the devices were shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for the stated intended use. For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market and foreign market, we hold a Quality Management System certification to ISO 13485:2016. Additionally, for all products manufactured for sale into the applicable countries, we hold a Quality Management System certification in compliance with the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP). For all products manufactured for sale into European Union countries, we hold a Full Quality Assurance System certification to Directive 93/42/EEC Annex II (excluding section 4). All of these certifications are issued by our notified body, BSI, and are reviewed annually.
Compliance with domestic and international laws and regulations may affect our business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto may substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining, and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. We expect this regulatory environment will continue to require effort and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply could delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product,

the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties.
The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information, and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California) have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties.
The sale of medical products is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States.
We will continue to comply with applicable regulations of all countries in which our products are registered for sale.
We believe that we do not incur material costs in connection with compliance with environmental laws. 
Competitive Conditions
Major domestic competitors include BD and Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (“Medtronic,” formerly known as Covidien). Terumo Medical Corp., Smiths Medical, and B Braun are additional competitors with smaller market shares. BD and Medtronic have controlling U.S. market share; greater financial resources; larger and more established sales, marketing, and distribution organizations; and greater market influence, including long-term and/or exclusive contracts. Additionally, BD may be able to use its resources to improve its products through research or acquisitions or develop new products which may compete with our products.
We compete primarily on the basis of healthcare worker and patient safety, product performance, and quality. We believe our competitive advantages include, but are not limited to, our leadership in quality and innovation. We believe our products continue to be the most effective safety devices in today’s market. Our VanishPoint® 1mL syringes meet the criteria set by pharmaceutical manufacturers for low dead space, which results in a reduction of wasted medication caused by residual medication remaining in the syringe after a dose has been administered. In some instances, the low dead space allows for additional doses to be obtained from a medication vial. Our syringe products include passive safety activation, require less disposal space, and are activated while in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle. Our price per unit is competitive or even lower than the competition once all the costs incurred during the life cycle of a syringe are considered. Such life cycle costs include disposal costs, testing and treatment costs for needlestick injuries, and treatment for contracted illnesses resulting from needlestick injuries.
EasyPoint® retractable needles offer unique safety benefits not found in other commercially available safety needles.  Manually activated safety needles that compete with EasyPoint® must be removed from the patient, exposing the contaminated needle prior to activation of the manual safety mechanism.  EasyPoint® needles allow for activation of the automated retraction mechanism while the needle is still in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle and effectively reducing the risk of needlestick injuries.  EasyPoint® retractable needles are compatible with Luer-fitting syringes, including pre-filled syringes.  In addition, EasyPoint® retractable needles may be activated with fluid in the syringe, making it applicable for aspiration procedures such as blood collection.
Employees
As of March 11, 2022, we had 235 employees. 233 of such employees were full time employees. We provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status, ancestry, veteran status, workers’ compensation status or any other
