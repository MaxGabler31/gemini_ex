Item 1. Business
Our Company
Charah Solutions, Inc. (“Charah Solutions,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading provider of mission-critical environmental and maintenance services to the power generation industry, enabling our customers to address challenges related to the remediation of ash ponds and landfills at open and closed power plant sites while continuously operating and providing necessary electric power to communities nationwide. 
In 2018, we performed work at more than 50 coal-fired and nuclear power generation sites nationwide. We are the only service provider in the United States offering a suite of coal ash management and recycling, environmental remediation, and outage maintenance services. We also design and implement solutions for complex environmental projects (such as coal ash pond closures) and facilitate coal ash recycling through byproduct sales and other beneficial use services. We believe we are a partner-of-choice for the power generation industry due to our industry-leading quality, safety, and compliance record, all of which are key criteria for our customers. 
Since our founding, we have continuously anticipated our customers’ evolving environmental needs, increasing the number of services we provide and our embedded presence at their power generation facilities. Compared to service providers with more limited scope, our multi-service platform allows customers to gain efficiencies from sourcing multiple required offerings from a single, trusted partner. 
We provide our services through two segments: Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services. Our Environmental Solutions segment includes remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales. Remediation and compliance services are associated with our customers’ need for multi-year environmental improvement and sustainability initiatives, whether driven by proactive engagement, by power generation customers, by regulatory requirements, or by consumer expectations and standards. Byproduct sales support both our power generation customers’ desire to profitably recycle recurring and historic volumes of coal combustion residuals (“CCRs”) and our ultimate end customers’ need for high-quality, cost-effective raw material substitutes. Our Maintenance and Technical Services segment includes fossil services and nuclear services. Fossil services are the recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and the routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities. Nuclear services, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, include routine maintenance, outage services, facility maintenance, and staffing solutions for nuclear power generation facilities. Our Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages).
As a result of these unique offerings, the embedded nature of our on-site presence, and our track record of successful execution, we have built long-term relationships with leading U.S. utilities and independent power producers, including Dominion Energy, Inc., Duke Energy Corporation, Dynegy Inc., Exelon Corporation, PPL Corporation, and The Southern Company, among others. In some cases, these relationships have spanned over 20 years. The national scale of our operational footprint is also a key competitive differentiator, as many competitors are localized, focusing on a single geographic area (sometimes isolated to a single plant). We operate in more than 20 states, resulting in an overall footprint and density in key markets that we believe is difficult to replicate. We believe our national reach enables us to successfully pursue new business within our existing customer base and to attract new customers while providing consistent quality, safety and compliance standards. 
Our services platform is led by a senior executive team with deep industry experience and supported by a highly skilled labor force. The nature of our work requires employees, particularly our nuclear end market-related labor force, to have specialized skills, training, and certifications in order for them to be allowed on-site at our customers’ facilities. Collectively, our focus on human capital management allows us to maintain and develop a labor force of highly qualified, well-trained personnel capable of handling our customers’ needs.
Market Opportunity 
The U.S. power industry is composed of critical infrastructure providing essential power generation to communities nationwide. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of 2016, there were over 500 large-scale facilities in the United States with generation capabilities of at least 250 megawatts, including over 200 coal-fired power plants and over 60 nuclear power plants (representing 99 nuclear reactors). With near-constant demand by consumers and industry on these baseload power providers, continuous operation of these facilities is critical with cost of downtime being both economic and reputational. To maintain continuous operations, these complex facilities have specialized and recurring environmental and maintenance service needs throughout their lifecycles. While pervasive across the entire power generation industry, these service needs are particularly significant for coal-fired and nuclear power plants given increasing environmental demands, the aging nature of the installed base, 
1

and the characteristics of the feedstock required to power such facilities. Due to the breadth and nature of these needs, power plant operators typically do not possess these capabilities internally and instead outsource these mission-critical and often regulatory-driven requirements to a fragmented set of service providers. The continuous need for these specialized services is supported by a number of significant dynamics: 
Coal-Fired Power Plants Have Significant and Recurring Environmental Management Needs Associated with Their Waste Byproducts 
Coal-fired power plants consistently generate various waste byproducts throughout the power generation process. The primary type of these waste byproducts are CCRs, commonly known as coal ash. CCRs come in various forms (including fly ash, bottom ash, and boiler slag) and are collected throughout the coal burning process. Although not considered a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (the “RCRA”), there are meaningful regulatory and reputational risks associated with the handling and disposal of coal ash. According to the American Coal Ash Association, more than 111 million tons of coal ash were generated in 2017. Coal ash management is mission-critical to the daily operations of power plants as they generally only have on-site storage capacity for three to four days of CCR waste accumulation. This requires continuous daily monitoring, handling, transportation, and disposal to enable ongoing power plant operation. In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) estimated that coal-fired utilities spend approximately $2.9 billion per year on coal ash management. Power plant operators typically engage specialized service providers to conduct this critical recurring activity on-site alongside their personnel operating the plant. 
Large Installed Base of Legacy Coal Ash Disposal Ponds That Require Remediation
Collected coal ash is disposed of or beneficially used (recycled) in a range of applications. According to the American Coal Ash Association, as of 2017, approximately 36% of coal ash generated was disposed of. According to the EPA published data in 2012, approximately 80% of the coal ash that was disposed of was disposed of on-site in ash ponds or landfills, and the balance was transported and disposed of off-site at third-party landfills. For many years, coal-fired power plants relied on ash ponds as the primary disposal locations for waste byproducts. The vast majority of these older inactive and older existing ash ponds were designed and constructed without regulatory mandated design standards to prevent impact to the environment, and will require remediation or closure in the future. As of 2016, the American Coal Ash Association estimated that more than 1.5 billion tons of coal ash existed in ash ponds and landfills around the country. The EPA estimated that, in 2012, there were over 1,100 active and inactive on-site ash ponds and landfills requiring remediation or closure. Many of these sites are very large (on average slightly over 120 acres) and will require significant capital from their owners as well as specialized environmental expertise to monitor on an ongoing basis, remediate, relocate the waste or completely close. 
Power Plant Operators Are Increasingly Focused on Environmental Stewardship and Regulatory Compliance 
Power plant operators face increasing pressure from advocacy groups and their communities to manage the environmental risks associated with their operations and, therefore, the industry is increasingly focused on environmental stewardship. Due to the considerable potential consequences associated with environmental liabilities, spending on environmental liability management has increased over time and is expected to increase in the future. 
 Additionally, power plants are highly regulated by government environmental authorities, both at the federal and state level, which have recently added compliance requirements. A recent example is the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; Final Rule (the “CCR Rule”). Passed in April 2015 by the EPA, the CCR Rule regulates the disposal of coal ash as a solid waste in response to two significant coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and Eden, North Carolina which caused widespread environmental damage. The CCR Rule established new requirements for the closure and remediation of existing ash ponds as well as restrictions on the location of new ash ponds. The CCR Rule will result in significant incremental environmental management costs for many industry participants. As an example, Duke Energy Corporation, PPL Corporation, The Southern Company, and Tennessee Valley Authority have stated they will spend over $11.7 billion combined on projects resulting from the CCR Rule through 2023. In addition, the power generation industry is proactively implementing environmental best practices across their assets, even when not yet required by law. 
Recycling Waste Byproducts Is a Critical Component of the Coal Ash Value Chain 
Coal ash can be recycled to produce positive environmental, economic, and performance benefits, such as reduced use of other natural resources, lower greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, and improved strength and durability of materials. According to the American Coal Ash Association, approximately 72 million tons of coal ash, or 64% of generated coal ash, was beneficially used in 2017. As of 2017, the leading beneficial use of coal ash was as a direct and more economic substitute for cement during the production of concrete (approximately 14 million tons of CCRs, annually as of 2017). Also, according to the American Coal Ash Association, in 2018, more than half of all the concrete produced in the United States was made with coal ash, which reduced GHG emissions equivalent to removing 2.5 million cars from the road every year. Coal ash use in various applications has compelling economic benefits as well. As of 2011, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association estimated that coal ash recycling 
2

would save approximately $105 billion over the next 20 years towards the cost to build roads, runways, and bridges. Additionally, there are technologies currently in development that improve the characteristics of certain types of coal ash, making them more viable for recycling purposes and ultimately increasing the addressable market of recyclable coal ash. 
Coal and Nuclear Power Generation Remains Indispensable Energy Sources
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of September 2017, coal and nuclear power generation combined are expected to remain key baseload energy sources for decades, providing at least 1.6 trillion kilowatt hours of energy production annually through 2040. As of September 2017, coal and nuclear power generation combined accounted for approximately 50% of domestic U.S. energy generation and is expected to contribute a similar percentage annually for at least the next five years. By 2030, they are projected to still contribute approximately 40% of domestic U.S. energy generation. Although other energy generation sources, such as natural gas and renewables, are projected to make moderate gains on a percentage contribution basis, we believe the aggregate demand for coal and nuclear power generation will remain robust. The combined coal and nuclear installed base is also deeply entrenched throughout the U.S. national power grid. 
Routine Nuclear Reactor Maintenance Is Non-Discretionary, Specialized, and Predictable 
Given the scale, complexity and near-constant operational demands on power plants of all energy types, routine maintenance is critical to the ongoing functionality of each facility. Regardless of energy type, power generation facilities have similar planned outages and recurring maintenance needs. Without these regular maintenance outages, power plants cannot maintain operations and risk more costly, unplanned service interruptions. This dynamic is particularly true for nuclear power generation where baseload power demands are more acute than other energy sources. According to the 2019 Annual Energy Outlook published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), nuclear power represented 19% of U.S. electricity generation. Nuclear energy generates the highest capacity factor of all fuel sources. According to the EIA, U.S. nuclear power plants had a capacity factor of 92%. U.S. nuclear power plants also produced 56% of U.S. emission-free fuel in 2017.
Recurring maintenance of nuclear reactors represents an attractive long-term market opportunity given the seasonal predictability of outages and expected longevity of nuclear power generation. Nuclear power plants typically run 24 hours a day, seven days a week over 12- to 24-month cycles with outages typically occurring during fall and spring. Since it is costly to take nuclear power plants offline, plant outages are planned, contracted, and announced far in advance and involve the completion of numerous maintenance services while offline (including inspections, repairs, maintenance, equipment replacement, facility modification, new construction and certifications). We estimate, based on our management’s experience and discussions with customers, our total addressable market for these services (including outsourced maintenance and capital needs) to be in excess of $5 billion annually. We believe this spend will increase over time as the nuclear reactor fleet continues to age and additional maintenance is required. Additionally, given the stringent safety requirements for the nuclear power industry, specialized licenses and training are required for on-site workforces, representing a considerable barrier to entry for prospective market participants. 
The Power Generation Industry Is Increasingly Requiring Larger Scale Environmental and Maintenance Service Providers 
The mounting burden of environmental compliance, consistent need to maintain aging facilities, and the focus on continuous and safe plant operations has the power generation industry (coal-fired and nuclear utilities in particular) increasingly seeking larger scale outsourced service providers as partners that can provide a range of services on their behalf. To date, most prospective service providers either have narrow service offerings or a highly localized geographic focus (sometimes limited to a single plant). Few service providers offer a broad set of service capabilities with a track record of quality service, exceptional safety, exacting environmental standards, and a reliable labor force. We believe the market opportunity for a specialized environmental and maintenance platform that can offer such a range of capabilities to the industry is substantial.

This co-location and integration into the daily operations results in direct relationships with key decision makers at every level of our customers’ organizations. We believe this embedded partnership deepens customer connectivity and drives longer customer tenure. In some cases, these relationships have spanned over 20 years. As examples, LG&E and KU Energy LLC, which are 
4

currently owned by PPL Corporation, have been customers for more than 20 years, and members of our management team have provided mission-critical services to Exelon Corporation for over 15 years. In the case of Exelon Corporation, these long-term relationships led to Exelon Corporation entrusting us with the outage maintenance needs across their nuclear fleet. We have also demonstrated the ability to grow our service offerings with a single customer. We first provided Duke Energy Corporation with byproduct sales in 2001 at two plants and now provide all of our coal-related services across nine of their plants. We believe these long-term relationships are critical for renewing existing contracts, winning incremental business from existing customers at new sites, and adding new customers. For example, over the last five years, we have achieved an approximately 90% renewal rate for contracts in our fossil services offerings up for renewal. 
Innovative Solutions to Our Customers’ Environmental Challenges 
Our customers regularly face complex, large-scale environmental challenges that require bespoke, technical solutions. We believe we have a proactive and differentiated approach to solving these challenges. Our internal technical and engineering experts have developed deep domain knowledge and capabilities in environmental remediation and beneficial use as a result of our long-term and significant experience in the sector. We believe this credibility, combined with an entrepreneurial mindset, enables us to source market opportunities not readily available to our competitors. 
As an example, we demonstrated this innovative approach for a major reclamation project at the Asheville Regional Airport in North Carolina. In the course of remediating an ash pond on-site at a nearby coal power plant, we had the vision to beneficially use that ash as structural fill underneath a newly constructed taxiway at the airport. Our engineers designed a state-of-the-art, highly engineered structural fill system to capture the ash in an environmentally sound way. Asheville Regional Airport saved approximately $12 million by using coal ash instead of traditional materials and approximately 4 million cubic yards of coal ash from an ash pond was beneficially used. We believe this innovative approach, coupled with new technologies and processes, generates additional value for our customers and stockholders. 
Entrepreneurial Management Team Supported by Highly Skilled Labor Force 
We are led by an experienced management team with an entrepreneurial mindset and keen focus on safety and customer service. Our senior executive team consists of industry veterans with deep industry experience, helping us provide high-quality operational execution and solidify long-term customer relationships. In addition to a commitment to develop internal talent, we have made key strategic external hires to further deepen our expertise. Our entrepreneurial mindset drives us to constantly search for new ways to maximize relevance to customers and develop innovative solutions. 
Our customers have unique certification and training requirements for the service providers they allow on-site. Our ability to hire, develop, and retain a highly skilled labor force with specialized skills, training, and certifications is a key differentiator in the sector. We also have a dedicated team of in-house professionals that focus exclusively on training, certification, and mentorship. As part of our commitment to safety and compliance, each of our on-site employees must complete a unique, rigorous training program. We train our managers to lead from the frontline and to share, involve, and support their teams. Our ability to nimbly staff large-scale projects is also critical. For example, within our nuclear services offering, we have the proven ability to quickly ramp up to in excess of 4,000 employees to align with our customers’ outage schedules and to service their planned maintenance needs. Collectively, our human capital management allows us to maintain and develop a labor force of highly qualified, well-trained personnel capable of handling our customers’ needs.
Our Growth Strategy 
Expand Market Share by Capitalizing on the Significant Environmental and Maintenance Needs of Power Generation Customers 
We believe we have a strong growth opportunity in the near term as U.S. coal-fired power generation facilities continue to remediate and close ash ponds and landfills. These projects are triggered as coal power plant operators preemptively manage environmental liabilities, comply with regulatory requirements (at the local, state, and federal level), and work to meet consumer standards for environmental sustainability. We estimate there are over 1,000 remaining ash ponds and landfills, substantially all of which remain to be remediated today, and that customer spending for our core services, including ash pond and landfill remediation, will increase significantly over the next three to five years. We believe spending on coal ash management will increase as well due to our customers’ increased focus on environmental stewardship. Additionally, we believe the market for mission-critical maintenance services in the nuclear power generation market is large and growing. We expect this market opportunity to grow over time as the nuclear reactor fleet continues to age and additional maintenance is required. 
Continue to Grow On-Site Services Revenue by Expanding Environmental and Maintenance Offerings 
We believe our broad platform of environmental and maintenance services is a competitive differentiator and, therefore, continuing to enhance the breadth of services offered to our existing customers is a key growth opportunity. We are a trusted partner and our team is embedded with the customer on-site to handle its most critical operational needs. As a result, we are well-positioned 
5

to identify relevant, attractive service offerings to add to our portfolio. We believe opportunities exist across our platform in waste byproduct management, recycling, environmental remediation, and maintenance services. We believe our customers will continue to find value in a full-service platform and source incremental services from us as an existing, on-site, trusted partner. 
Leverage New and Existing Customer Relationships to Maximize Fleet-Wide Opportunities 
Given the breadth of our service offering, the trend among our customers to consolidate service providers, and our access to our customers’ senior decision makers, we believe we are well-positioned to grow our market share with current customers by providing our existing services to other coal-fired and nuclear power plants within their fleets. We currently provide services at 45 of the 280 large-scale facilities in the United States, which we define as larger than 250 megawatts, representing an approximately 16% penetration rate. We see an opportunity to increase this percentage meaningfully. We will also seek to generate business with new utility customers, aiming ultimately to compete fleet-wide across their power plant footprints as well. We see similar opportunities in international geographies. 
Invest in Innovative Technologies, Processes, and Solutions 
We believe investments in new technology and processes present opportunities to provide higher-margin offerings while also improving the environment. The embedded nature of our operations gives us a superior understanding of unique customer problems allowing us to deploy innovative solutions. We believe there are opportunities for technological innovation in environmental compliance and stewardship. For example, our acquisition of SCB International Materials, Inc. (“SCB”) provided two new technologies for incremental beneficiation of coal ash and other industrial byproducts. We hope these innovative technologies will allow us to optimize our traditional fly ash sales and distribution, enter new markets for our products, and provide cleaner, environmentally friendly solutions to our customers. We intend to continue to invest in additional technologies and other processes that expand our portfolio of solutions and further establish us as an innovator in our industry. 
Enhance Our Platform via Disciplined Acquisitions 
We believe we can utilize a focused acquisition strategy to add adjacent capabilities and services and to enhance stockholder value. This strategy could enable us to add technical expertise, to expand into new geographies and to gain new customers. We intend to focus on environmental and industrial services, processes, and technologies that support our existing capabilities and customer needs. We believe our national scale and market leadership make us a natural consolidator, particularly in our highly fragmented industry. We have established a disciplined approach to identify acquisition targets with a core focus on growth, cash flow and return on investment.

Our nuclear services operations, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, consist of a broad platform of mission-critical professional, technical, and craft services spanning the entire asset life cycle of a nuclear power generator. Our nuclear services offerings include routine maintenance, outage services, facility maintenance, and staffing solutions for nuclear power generation facilities, and we are focused on expanding these offerings to include specialty welding, valve repairs, reactor and turbine support, and specialty engineering, among other services. Additionally, our staffing services and solutions include professional, technical, and craft staffing; managed and turnkey staffing solutions; and staff recruitment and oversight services. A substantial portion of our nuclear services operations are driven by scheduled nuclear maintenance outages, which are typically planned for every 12 to 24 months.

Safety Record 
Utilities and independent power producers are focused on strong environmental and safety considerations as key factors for awarding on-site service provider contracts. We believe our strong safety record provides a distinct competitive advantage. We believe we have developed trusted relationships and credibility with regulatory agencies and utilities over the past 30 years due to our long-standing safety record supported by an experienced team of in-house safety and regulatory compliance professionals. 
Safety is integral to our culture and our results, and is one of our core values. We believe we operate under the strictest safety standards and are dedicated to maintaining a safe working environment. Our dedicated in-house team of safety professionals develops and trains our employees and subcontractors to not only perform their jobs safely but also to proactively contribute to a safe workplace. This expert team includes highly trained professionals who are accredited Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) trainers, along with full-time transportation specialists in both over-the-road and rail operations. 
 Furthermore, we endorse the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s Safety Culture Policy Statement with respect to our services provided to nuclear utilities, which includes a list of nine traits further defining a positive safety culture: (i) leadership safety values and actions; (ii) problem identification and resolution; (iii) personal accountability; (iv) work processes; (v) continuous learning; (vi) environment for raising concerns; (vii) effective safety communications; (viii) respectful work environment; and (ix) questioning attitude. Given the inherent stringent safety requirements surrounding the nuclear power industry, specialized licenses and training are required for all employees. 
We recognize the unique safety issues related to working with our utility industry partners. Our Engineering, Environmental and Quality Group has the expertise and experience to ensure our operations are compliant with local, state, and federal regulations and exceed customary safety standards in our industry. 
Sales and Marketing 
We believe our dedicated sales team has built successful and long-term relationships with the nation’s largest power generators, and we believe we can leverage the deep relationships and strong operational track record we have built to broaden our on-site presence and deepen client partnerships. We also seek to generate business with new power generation customers, 
7

aiming ultimately to compete enterprise-wide across their power plant footprints as well. Through close contact with utility management and personal relationships developed on a daily basis by our network of embedded field team of regional managers and site managers, we believe we are able to understand our customers’ needs to quickly respond to their next project needs and provide creative solutions. Our team of professionals includes professional engineers, experienced site managers, and seasoned estimators who strive to be detailed, accurate, and upfront, allowing us to minimize contract modifications after the work begins. We employ what we refer to as a “zippered” organization approach to customer service and marketing, with relationships up and down the organization. By structuring the organization around our customers’ needs through this unique network of regional field operations managers, we ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget and, additionally, are able to quickly recognize opportunities to cross-sell and market our services. 
Customers 
We have leveraged our long-term, strong relationships to become a preferred provider to many of the largest power generation companies in the United States. In 2018, we performed work at more than 50 plants for more than 20 “blue-chip” utilities, including Ameren Corporation, Big Rivers Electric Corporation, Dominion Energy, Inc., Duke Energy Corporation, Dynegy Inc., Exelon Corporation, Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., NRG Energy, Inc., PPL Corporation, and The Southern Company. The majority of our power generation clients are investment grade. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, Duke Energy and Exelon each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. No other major customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. If one of these major customers decided to stop purchasing our services, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Joint Ventures and Contractual Arrangements 
A portion of our ash sales are provided through the following two joint ventures.
Ash Venture Joint Venture 
In December 2013, we formed Ash Venture LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (“Ash Venture”), which provides ash management and marketing services to the utility industry. Ash Venture is a joint venture between Charah, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company (“Charah”), and an unrelated third party. Charah owns 67% and the third party owns 33% of Ash Venture. 
Equity Method Investment 
In January 2016, we formed a joint venture with an unrelated third party, which markets and sells fly ash to the ready-mix concrete market. We account for the joint venture under the equity method. Charah and the third party each own 50% of the joint venture. 
Competition 
The power and environmental services industries are highly fragmented with a limited subset of competitors maintaining a national presence, few of which offer the same spectrum of services we provide through our Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services segments. Our competitors consist of a combination of large environmental and waste management businesses, as well as hundreds of regional and local companies with limited service areas, typically servicing only one to three sites each. The highly fragmented and regional nature of our industry has produced a limited number of competitors with national scope. 
We are the only service provider offering a suite of CCR management and recycling, environmental remediation, and outage maintenance services. While some competitors are significantly engaged in one of the core areas in the power or environmental services value chain, many have limited or no engagement in the majority of our core areas. 
Seasonality 
Based on historic trends, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally due to demand within our industry as well as weather conditions. For additional information on the effects of seasonality on our operating results, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements—Seasonality of Business.” 
Risk Management and Insurance 
The nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations, including possible damages to the environment. Such potential liabilities could involve, for example, claims for remediation costs, personal injury, property damage, and damage to the environment, including natural resources, claims of employees, customers, or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations, or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work. We also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions in connection 
8

with alleged violations of regulatory requirements which could be significant. We maintain general liability, contractor’s pollution liability policies (as well as additional pollution and remediation policies as needed), vehicle liability, employment practices liability, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies. We also carry property insurance.
Regulation 
Our utility customers involved in coal-based and nuclear-based power generation are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Our operations and services for our utility customers are subject to many of the same environmental laws and regulations that govern the host utility site. These environmental laws and regulations, among other things, impose limits on the discharge of pollutants to the air and water and establish requirements for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, remediation of releases of hazardous substances, and reclamation of land. Compliance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations adds to the cost of doing business. Moreover, in order to establish and operate power plants and collect, transport, and manage CCRs, we and our customers have obtained various federal, state, and local environmental permits and must comply with these permits or processes and procedures approved by regulatory authorities. Any failure to comply with these laws or regulations, permits or processes and procedures could result in the issuance of substantial fines and penalties or other sanctions and may cause us (or our customers) to incur environmental or reclamation liabilities or subject us (or our customers) to third-party claims. 
The operations of our Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are usually performed on-site at the host utility power plant and, as such, the utility holds permits for our operational activities performed on-site. At facilities that we own, we secure the permits. 
In spite of safeguards, our operations entail risks of regulatory noncompliance or releases of hazardous substances that could create an environmental liability. 
Regulations Affecting Our Maintenance and Technical Services Segment 
The fossil services offerings provided in our Maintenance and Technical Services segment are subject to several environmental laws and regulations that have the potential to increase operating costs and to give rise to increased risk of regulatory noncompliance and environmental liabilities. 

• | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The RCRA Subtitle C regulates handling, transporting, and disposing of hazardous waste. RCRA Subtitle D regulates non-hazardous wastes and delegates authority to states to develop solid waste programs. In 1991, the EPA issued final regulations under Subtitle D of the RCRA, which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for municipal solid waste garbage landfills. In 2015, the EPA published regulations under RCRA Subtitle D for CCRs generated by the electric utility industry. Subtitle D municipal solid waste regulations are implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. The CCR Rule regulates the disposal of CCRs under Subtitle D of the RCRA as non-hazardous wastes, as discussed below.


• | EPA CCRs Rule. As a CCR, coal ash had previously been largely exempted from regulation under the RCRA by the “Bevill amendment” and, therefore, was subject to state solid waste regulations. However, after a major spill at a Tennessee Valley Authority site in Tennessee in 2008, the EPA began a rulemaking process to regulate CCRs. That process ended with the publication in April 2015 of the CCR Rule to regulate the disposal of CCRs, including fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas desulfurization products generated at coal-fired power plants. The CCR Rule, among other things, regulates CCRs as non-hazardous waste and imposes new standards for location, groundwater monitoring, and dam stability on surface impoundments and requires long-term monitoring of existing and new surface impoundments and landfill facilities. The CCR Rule also preserves an exemption for CCRs when used for beneficial purposes. In March 2018, the EPA issued proposed Phase-1 1-Part rules to reconsider certain sections of the 2015 CCR rules. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final Phase-1 1-Part rule to modify the CCR rules to establish the program to grant states authorization with approved CCR permit programs under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (the “WIIN Act”). The Phase-1 1-Part rule also allows CCRs to be used during certain closure situations and addresses certain matters remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2016. The EPA intends to reconsider and propose additional regulations to address litigation decisions by Courts related to CCRs.


• | WIIN Act. In December 2016, Congress passed the WIIN Act, which, among other things, establishes state primacy for enforcement of the CCR Rule. The WIIN Act directed the EPA to provide guidance to states on issuing state regulations to manage the CCR program. The EPA published the Coal Combustion Residuals State Permit Program Guidance Document (Interim Final) in August 2017. States may now submit their regulatory programs for CCRs

9

and receive EPA approval that they are equivalent to or more stringent than federal guidance. As noted above, the rule finalized by the EPA in July 2018 further implements the objectives of the WIIN Act by allowing states or the EPA to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs. 
The CCR Rule may require adjustments to our operations, and the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of CCRs could increase. We manage mine reclamation projects that may be subject to the CCR Rule. The CCR Rule establishes national minimum criteria for landfills and impoundments containing CCRs, and includes restrictions on their location, design, and operation, as well as groundwater monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and closure requirements. The rule also requires closure, shutdown, or retrofitting of certain non-complying units or impoundments. Citizens and states now have the right to bring lawsuits to enforce the new CCR Rule against owners and operators. Since the CCR Rule was finalized, citizens and environmental organizations have brought several suits against the utility owners and operators of CCR impoundments. 
The CCR Rule affirms that beneficial uses of CCRs remain exempt from federal waste regulation under the RCRA’s “Bevill exclusion.” Beneficial use is defined by the regulation to cover uses where CCRs provide a functional benefit, substitute for the use of a virgin material, meet the product specifications, follow established specifications for use, and are environmentally equivalent to the material that they substitute for or are below all thresholds for safety and environmental impact. In February 2014, the EPA released a report determining that the use of fly ash in concrete constitutes a beneficial use, and the CCR Rule specifically notes that the incorporation of fly ash in concrete, as a replacement for Portland cement, is one of “the most widely recognized beneficial applications” of CCRs. The CCR Rule indicates that the use of CCRs in applications such as road base generally would qualify as beneficial use, so long as relevant regulations and guidelines are followed. 
Both industry and environmental organizations have challenged the CCR Rule. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled on several cases involving CCRs. The D.C. Circuit Court remanded certain provisions of the CCR Rule back to the EPA to address through modification of the rules. The D.C. Circuit decision has indicated that CCR disposal or storage units that have only clay liners are not protective and the EPA must now address the impacts to the CCR rules. 
In September 2016, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (the “Civil Rights Commission”) issued a report which determined that CCR disposal facilities can negatively impact environmental justice communities. While the Civil Rights Commission cannot require changes to EPA regulations, environmental organizations may seek to use the Civil Rights Commission’s report to spur the EPA to make regulatory changes. 
Regulations Affecting the Coal Industry 
The fossil services offerings of our Maintenance and Technical Services segment are dependent upon managing CCRs produced by our customers, typically coal-fired power plants. Coal-fired power plants and the coal industry are generally highly regulated under federal and state law. Regulation affecting this industry is ever-evolving, including the following: 

• | Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 and subsequent amendments, particularly the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and corresponding state laws and EPA regulations (discussed below), regulate the emission of air pollutants such as SOx, NOx, particulate matter (“PM”), and ozone. The EPA finalized more stringent ambient air quality standards for fine PM in January 2013 and for ozone in October 2015, and issued final policy assessment for NOx in April 2017 and draft policy assessment for SOx in August 2017. The EPA concluded that the current primary NOx standard is adequate, but has not taken additional steps with respect to the SOx standards. To meet emissions limits, utilities have been required to make changes, such as changing fuel sources, installing expensive pollution control equipment, and, in some cases, shutting down plants.


• | Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. In July 2011, the EPA adopted the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the “CSAPR”), a cap-and-trade type program requiring utilities to make substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx and emissions that contribute to ozone and in fine PM emissions in order to reduce interstate transport of such pollution. The CSAPR was challenged and vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2012, but that decision was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in April 2014. The D.C. Circuit has since lifted its stay on the CSAPR and ruled in favor of the EPA on the remaining significant issues. In January 2016, the EPA filed a brief with the D.C. Circuit addressing the remaining legal challenges left undecided by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 decision. Conforming with a court-ordered schedule, the EPA implemented the first phase of the CSAPR in 2015 and 2016 and the second phase in 2017. In November 2014 and January 2015, the EPA issued notices of data availability outlining emission allowance allocations for existing generating units that began operating before and after 2010. In September 2016, the EPA finalized a rule updating the CSAPR in order to maintain 2008 ozone emission limitations in downwind states by addressing summertime (May-September) transport of ozone pollution. The update, which commenced in May 2017, sets stricter NOx ozone season emission budgets in 22 states and could affect up to 886 coal-fired facilities. These emission control requirements, for both NOx and SO2, can impact the quantity and quality of CCRs produced at a power plant, add to the costs of operating a power plant, and make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants.

• | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Certain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”) and similar state laws, impose strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties for investigation and remediation of regulated materials at contaminated sites, including our sites, customer sites, and sites to which we sent wastes, including CCRs. CCRs may contain materials such as metals that are regulated materials under these laws. Management of CCRs can give rise to liability under the CERCLA and similar laws.


• | Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Power Plants. In February 2012, under its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Power Plants rule, the EPA promulgated final limits on mercury and other toxic chemicals from new and modified power plants. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA to undertake cost-benefit analysis when promulgating mercury and air toxics standards. In April 2016, the EPA published a supplemental finding pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court’s directive, which is currently being challenged in the D.C. Circuit. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA’s motion to stay the litigation while the EPA reconsiders its finding that the rule is “appropriate and necessary” as required under the Clean Air Act. If upheld, requirements to control mercury emissions could result in implementation of additional technologies at power plants that could negatively affect fly ash quality.


• | GHG Emissions. Some states and regions have adopted legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions, either directly or through mechanisms such as renewable portfolio standards for electric utilities. These programs require electric utilities to increase their use of renewable energy such as solar and wind power. Federal GHG legislation appears unlikely in the near term. The EPA has initiated review of rules finalized in August 2015 for GHG emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric power plants and for carbon emissions from existing sources in the power sector (the latter being known as the “Clean Power Plan”). The Clean Power Plan establishes state-specific, rate-based reduction goals for carbon emissions and calls on the power sector to reduce carbon emissions to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The EPA proposed rules titled the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (the “ACE Rule”) and sought comments on a framework to replace the Clean Power Plan. Under the ACE Rule, the EPA is proposing to allow efficiency improvements at existing coal plants and proposes to regulate emissions from new power plants at different levels and has taken an inside the fence approach to emissions limitations. If the proposed replacement ACE Rule is finalized by the EPA, various states’ utility companies may be encouraged to substitute electricity generation from low-emitting coal and natural gas plants and zero-emitting renewable sources for generation from higher-emitting coal plants. Such changes in the energy market could impact the quantity of CCRs produced by our suppliers, add to the cost of operating power plants, and make coal-fired power plants a less attractive option in the planning and commissioning of new energy generating facilities.


• | EPA Water Quality Regulations. The EPA is addressing water quality impacts from coal-fired power plants and coal mining operations. In September 2015, the EPA finalized new effluent limitations under the Clean Water Act for steam electric power generating facilities. The final rule requires operators of coal plants with a generating capacity over 50 megawatts to store fly ash and bottom ash in dry landfills, rather than containment ponds. Approximately 12% of coal plants will be affected, and some marginal operations may shut down rather than face the expense of complying with the new effluent discharge requirements. Multiple challenges to the effluent limitation guidelines were consolidated and are pending before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rulemaking postponing certain compliance dates under the effluent limitation guidelines. In addition, the EPA finalized new regulations to minimize adverse environmental impacts to aquatic life from cooling water intake structures at existing electric generating plants, which were challenged by environmental and industry groups at the Fifth and Second Circuit Courts of Appeals, which remain pending. More stringent regulation of coal-fired power plants and coal mining operations could increase the cost for utilities and, thus, indirectly impact the availability and cost of fly ash for our CCR activities.

Increasingly strict requirements, such as those described above, generally will increase the cost of doing business and may make coal burning less attractive for utilities. Faced with the prospect of more stringent regulations, litigation by environmental groups, and the relatively low cost of natural gas, an increasing number of electric utilities are reducing their portfolio of coal-fired power plants. For example, in recent years, multiple companies have announced plans to close coal-fired power plant units or plants, or dropped plans to open new plants, citing the cost of compliance with pending or new environmental regulations and the relatively low cost of natural gas. The potential negative impact on job prospects in the utility and mining industries has prompted considerable concern in Congress, leading to calls to restrict the EPA’s regulatory authority and prompting the EPA to reconsider the same. The outcome of these developments cannot be predicted. To date, our business has not been significantly impacted by these developments; however, if the rate of coal-fired power plant closures increases, we may be adversely affected in the future. Nevertheless, we believe that reliance on coal for a substantial amount of power generation in the United States is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Regulations Affecting the Nuclear Power Industry 
Our nuclear power generation customers are subject to regulations from a number of entities, including the applicable U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (the “IAEA”). Regulations include, among other things: (i) systems for nuclear material safeguards implemented by the IAEA, (ii) global-scale agreements on nuclear safety, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and (iii) additional general regulations for nuclear facilities under the Atomic Energy Act and Nuclear Waste Policy Act, including strict licensing requirements, inspection procedures, and regulations governing the maintenance, shutdown, and dismantling of nuclear facilities and the management and disposal of radioactive wastes. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act (the “PAA”) regulates, among other things, radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry, including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear-related incidents. The PAA provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators, which also apply to us as part of our services to the U.S. nuclear energy industry. 
Motor Carrier Operations 
Through the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and, therefore, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) and various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing activities, such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations; regulatory safety; hazardous materials labeling, placarding, and marking; financial reporting; and certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, and requiring onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size. 
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements that often mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. DOT regulations also mandate drug testing of drivers. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,895 employees. Approximately 578 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, 92% of which are employed in the nuclear services operations of our Maintenance and Technical Services segment. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
