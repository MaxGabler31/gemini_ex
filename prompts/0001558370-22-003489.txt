Item 1.   Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing novel cell therapies to people with cancer. We are a leader in the development of T-cell therapies for solid tumors and have reported responses in multiple solid tumor indications. 
​
Our proprietary platform enables us to identify cancer targets, find and develop cell therapy candidates active against those targets and produce therapeutic candidates for administration to patients. Our cell therapy candidates include Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor (“SPEAR” T-cells) which use genetically engineered T-cell receptors (“TCRs”); next generation Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (“TILs”) where a patient’s own T-cells are co-administered with our next generation technology, and HLA-independent TCRs (“HiTs”) where surface proteins are targeted independently of the peptide-HLA complex. Our cell therapies are currently manufactured on an autologous or per patient basis and we have a proprietary preclinical allogeneic platform for the development of “off the shelf” cell therapies. 
​
Our MAGE-A4 cell therapy franchise includes T-cell therapy products targeting solid tumor indications in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed, with responses seen in eight indications (head and neck, esophagogastric junction (“EGJ”), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-squamous, synovial sarcoma, melanoma, bladder, ovarian and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) indications) across the franchise. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for the lead product (afamitresgene autoleucel or “afami-cel”) is targeted for filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in Q4 2022 for synovial sarcoma. We have multiple clinical trials ongoing or planned across the remainder of the MAGE-A4 franchise: 
​

● | SPEARHEAD-1 Phase 2 Trial with afami-cel (ADP-A2M4): A registration directed Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing in synovial sarcoma in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. Enrollment in Cohort 1 is complete, and the cohort met its primary endpoint with an overall response rate (ORR) per independent review of 34%. Subject to the successful filing and approval of a BLA by the FDA we plan to commercially launch afami-cel in the United States (“U.S.”). Cohort 2 of the trial is ongoing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | SURPASS Phase 1 Trial with ADP-A2M4CD8: Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 1 trial for our next generation SPEAR T-cell, ADP-A2M4CD8, including for patients with lung, gastroesophageal, head and neck, ovarian and bladder cancers in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. An overall response rate of 36% was reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) conference in 2021 with a complete response in a patient with ovarian cancer and partial responses reported in patients with ovarian, head and neck, esophagogastric junction, bladder and synovial sarcoma cancers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | SURPASS -2 Phase 2 Trial with ADP-A2M4CD8: A Phase 2 clinical trial with ADP-A2M4CD8 in esophageal and EGJ cancers has been initiated and is enrolling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A further Phase 2 trial with ADP-A2M4CD8 in ovarian cancer (“SURPASS-3”) is planned to start later in 2022 and an additional cohort to the SURPASS trial combining ADP-A2M4CD8 with a checkpoint inhibitor is also in planning. 
​
We are also planning to initiate a Phase 1 trial with a new next-generation SPEAR T-cell targeting MAGE-A4 for the treatment of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or ovarian cancer. Developed in collaboration with Noile-Immune Biotech Inc. (“Noile-Immune”), this product (ADP-A2M4N7X19) incorporates IL-7 and CCL19 in the cell therapy product.
​
Outside of the MAGE-A4 franchise, we have an active preclinical pipeline of cell therapy candidates with the aim of delivering five new autologous cell therapies to the clinic by 2025. The pipeline includes new autologous SPEAR T-cells, SPEAR T-cells addressing alternative HLA-types, next-generation SPEAR T-cells, HiTs and next-generation TILs. These are being developed internally and in collaboration with third parties including Alpine Immune Sciences 

1



(“Alpine”), the National Center for Cancer Immune Therapy in Denmark (“CCIT”) and Noile-Immune. A clinical trial application (“CTA”) for Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (“TILs”) incorporating IL-7 has been filed in Denmark, with a clinical trial planned to start in 2022 at CCIT. These approaches enable us to further enhance and extend the reach of our cell therapies thus increasing the number of patients we can potentially treat.
We are also developing allogeneic or “off-the-shelf” cell therapies utilizing a proprietary allogeneic platform. The platform utilizes cells derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (“iPSCs”), which can be gene-edited to express our engineered TCRs or other constructs and then differentiated into the required end cell type, for example T-cells. The platform is applicable to all of our cell therapies and we plan to bring two allogeneic programs to the clinic by 2025, the first for allogeneic cell therapies targeting MAGE-A4. 
We have strategic collaborations in place with Astellas and Genentech Inc (“Genentech”):

● | During Q3 2021 we announced a strategic collaboration with Genentech and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd.to research, develop, and commercialize allogeneic T-cell therapies (the “Genentech Collaboration”). The collaboration covers the research and development of “off-the-shelf” cell therapies for up to five shared cancer targets (“off-the-shelf” products) and the development of a novel allogeneic personalized cell therapy platform. Under the terms of the agreement, we have received an upfront payment of $150 million and will receive additional payments of $150 million over five years, unless the agreement is earlier terminated. In addition, we may be eligible to receive research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones payments potentially exceeding $3 billion in aggregate value. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales in the mid-single to low-double digits. We have the right to opt in to a 50/50 U.S. profit/cost share on “off-the-shelf” products. If we elect to opt in, then we will be eligible to share 50 percent of profits and losses from U.S. sales on such products and are eligible to receive ex-U.S. regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, as well as royalties on ex-U.S. net sales.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | We also have a strategic collaboration program ongoing with Astellas (through its wholly-owned subsidiary Universal Cells) in relation to up to three targets with the aim of co-developing T-cell therapy candidates directed to those targets and utilizing our allogeneic platform for “off-the-shelf” cell therapies. The first target subject to the collaboration is the mesothelin target to which a HiT cell therapy is being developed. A second target has been nominated by Astellas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We also have several development and research collaborations including our collaboration with GSK for the development, manufacture and commercialization of TCR therapeutic candidates for up to five programs, a clinical and preclinical alliance agreement with MD Anderson Cancer Center and research collaborations with Alpine, Noile-Immune, and CCIT.
​
We are an integrated cell therapy company with our own manufacturing facility in the U.S. and dedicated lentiviral vector manufacturing in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). This enables us to continue improving the patient experience associated with our cell therapies including the ability to rapidly introduce improvements to the manufacturing process and patient supply chain. 
Business Strategy 
Building on our leadership position with engineered T-cell therapies in solid tumor indications, our strategic objective is to be a world leader in designing and delivering cell therapies that transform the lives of people with cancer. To achieve our objectives, our core value drivers are as follows:
Progressing two cell therapies toward commercialization. We are planning to file a BLA with the FDA during Q4 2022 for afami-cel. Data from Cohort 1 of the SPEARHEAD-1 trial met its primary endpoint. Afami-cel continues to show a favorable benefit:risk profile across the patients treated. BLA preparations are underway with pediatric plans agreed with regulatory agencies and multiple BLA-directed activities including vector and T-cell therapy manufacturing process characterization progressing. Further Phase 2 trials are underway (SURPASS-2 in esophageal and 

2



esophagogastric junction cancers) or anticipated to start later in 2022 (SURPASS-3 in ovarian cancer). Depending on the clinical data obtained from those trials, we plan to file a BLA following conclusion of those trials.
Progressing two cell therapies into later clinical phase. Subject to the data from ongoing clinical trials, we plan to rapidly progress clinical candidates through clinical trials and towards BLA filing. For example, our ADP-A2M4CD8 therapy is in a Phase 1 clinical trial (SURPASS) focusing on MAGE-A4 positive patients including in lung, head and neck, bladder, ovarian and gastroesophageal indications. A first Phase 2 trial has already been started in patients with esophageal and esophagogastric junction indications based on initial data from the Phase 1 SURPASS trial and a second Phase 2 trial is due to be initiated later in 2022 in ovarian cancer patients. Depending on the data obtained, additional indications may be identified for ADP-A2M4CD8 to be progressed into later phase trials and ultimately to a BLA filing. 
​
Progress five new autologous cell therapies into the clinic within five years. We continue to progress our pipeline of cell therapy candidates including HiT cell therapy candidates, new SPEAR T-cells and next-generation TILs. We aim to progress these candidates through our preclinical pipeline quickly and start Phase 1 clinical trials once preclinical work is complete. For example, a next-generation TIL trial in collaboration with CCIT is in the process of being initiated with a CTA filed in 2021 in Denmark, and a Phase 1 clinical trial with ADP-A2M4N7X19, a new next-generation product incorporating IL-7 and CCL19 is planned to be initiated later in 2022.
Continuing to develop “off-the-shelf” cell immunotherapies and progress two cell therapies to the clinic within five years. We continue to develop our “off-the-shelf” (allogeneic) platform, which is broadly applicable to cell therapies, both internally and in collaboration with our partners Astellas and Genentech. The first allogeneic product includes a SPEAR T-cell targeting MAGE-A4 and a second allogeneic product includes a HiT targeting mesothelin (partnered with Astellas). 
Continuing to improve our manufacturing and patient supply processes to optimize how we deliver our cell therapies to patients. Our integrated cell therapy capabilities enable us to continually enhance our cell and vector manufacturing and supply processes which we believe will ultimately enable us to treat patients quicker, at a lower cost and more effectively. We are planning to open a new manufacturing facility dedicated to allogeneic cell therapy manufacturing in 2022. This facility is co-located with our research facility in the U.K. Additionally we are expanding the manufacturing capacity in our existing autologous manufacturing facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Expanding our intellectual property portfolio. We continue to build and develop our technology platform, comprising intellectual property, proprietary methods and know-how in the field of cell therapies. These assets form the foundation of our ability to strengthen our product pipeline and defend and expand our position as a leader in cell therapy.
Our Cell Therapies for Cancer 
The Immune System and T-cells
The immune system plays an important role in targeting and destroying cancer cells. Specifically, T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell, and their receptors create a natural system that is designed to scan the body for diseased cells. In general, cells process proteins internally and then convert these proteins into peptide fragments which are then presented on the cell surface by a protein complex called the Human Leukocyte Antigen (“HLA”). T-cells naturally scan all other cells in the body for the presence of abnormal peptide fragments, such as those generated from infectious agents. Recognition of this peptide-HLA complex takes place through the T-cell receptor or TCR expressed on the T-cells. However, binding of naturally occurring TCRs to cancer targets tends to be very poor because cancer proteins appear very similar to naturally occurring proteins on healthy cells. 
Cancer Target Identification and Validation
Before developing any engineered T-cell therapy, it is important to identify and validate a suitable target cancer peptide or protein. The target must be expressed only on the cancer cells of interest and with expression in normal non-

3



cancerous tissue only where a risk to the patient would be deemed acceptable. Careful validation and identification of targets is important to ensure that any engineered cell therapy is specific to the targeted cancer and does not bind to the same target on non-cancer cells, or that the receptor in the cell therapy does not recognize a similar peptide or protein derived in normal cells. Our target identification and validation platform is focused on three approaches. First, we identify and validate peptide-HLA targets for cancer testis antigens for the most prevalent HLA-type, for example, the HLA A2 peptide for the MAGE-A4 antigen. Second, we identify and validate similar peptides for non-cancer testis antigens which are closely related to a specific disease indication, for example, the AFP antigen. Finally, we identify and validate surface HLA peptides for these existing intracellular targets in the context of different HLA types as well as other extracellular cell surface targets for HLA-independent TCRs or HiT constructs ensuring that we can address a broader patient population either across multiple HLA types across our existing therapeutic candidates or cell surface targets, such as mesothelin, without HLA restriction, respectively.
​
Cell Therapies
We have developed a range of cell therapies all of which utilize the interaction between a T-cell and its TCR’s and a peptide or protein. Our cell therapies can be made directly from a patient’s own T-cells (“autologous” cell therapies) or manufactured from stem cells (“allogeneic” cell therapies).

For all of our autologous cell therapies patient T-cells are extracted and are then engineered to generate the end cell therapy whether this is through engineering of the TCR itself or through the addition of another agent which enhances the efficacy of the TCR or T-cell. The nature of the engineering impacts the type of cell therapy product generated. The engineered T-cells are then expanded and infused back into the patient. When these T-cells encounter a recognized peptide or protein within the patient’s body, they multiply and initiate the destruction of the targeted cancer cells. 
For our allogeneic T-cell therapies, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ("iPSCs”) are gene edited to express the engineered TCR or HiT and potentially a range of next gen modifications. As part of the gene editing the iPSCs are also edited to remove certain HLA-type expression so that patients expressing any HLA-type can be treated with the same end product. Those gene-edited iPSCs are then differentiated, using a number of directed process steps, into T-cells, which can then be used to treat patients expressing the tumor antigen to which the TCR or HiT is directed.
​
Our SPEAR T-cells 
Following identification of a suitable target peptide, we identify TCRs that are capable of binding to that target peptide or protein. We then engineer and optimize those identified receptors to enhance their ability to recognize and bind to the cancer targets, thereby enabling a highly targeted immunotherapy which complements a patient’s immune system. The optimized TCR for the cell therapy then undergoes extensive preclinical safety testing prior to administration to patients. A lentiviral vector is used to transfer the engineered TCR into the patient’s T-cells if that patient has the relevant target and HLA type for our TCR cell therapy. The optimized cell therapy then undergoes extensive preclinical safety testing prior to administration to patients. Our SPEAR T-cell platform technology enables us to develop a pipeline of targets and TCR therapeutic candidates that we believe may be effective in a variety of cancer types that have progressed following treatment with currently available and experimental therapies. Within our MAGE-A4 franchise we have three SPEAR T-cells being developed, afami-cel (our first generation MAGE-A4 targeted SPEAR T-cell therapy), ADP-A2M4CD8 (a next-generation therapy incorporating a CD8α homodimer to increase potency) and ADP-A2M4N7X19 (a new next-generation cell therapy incorporating IL-7 and CCL19). 
Our HiT Cell Therapies
Naturally occurring TCRs recognize peptides that are presented on the cell surface by a protein complex called HLA. Patient treatment with our SPEAR T-cells requires patients to express a particular HLA-type. We have now developed a TCR platform capable of producing TCRs able to recognize targets expressed on the surface of cancer cells independently of HLA-type. The TCR is engineered to recognize and bind to a cell surface protein. The HiT platform 

4



enables us to identify suitable targets and to then generate engineered HiTs which can bind and interact with those targets. These HLA-independent TCRs or HiTs use the same immune system processes as naturally occurring TCRs.
Our Next-Generation TIL Therapies
TIL therapy utilizes TILs taken from a patient’s tumor. A section of the tumor is excised, the TILs are isolated and then those TILs which bind to tumor antigens are cultured and then further engineered to co-express one of our next generation technologies with the aim of making them more effective at attacking cancer cells. The TILs are then infused back into the patient. The first next-generation TIL is being developed in collaboration with CCIT, in Denmark and will combine CCIT’s TIL process with our next generation IL-7 technology to generate TIL-IL7 cell therapies.
Our Clinical Product Pipeline 
MAGE-A4 franchise
We have multiple cell therapies in clinical trials or entering clinical trials which target indications in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. The clinical trials ongoing are reflected in the clinical pipeline diagram below:

​

● | SPEARHEAD-1 Phase 2 Trial with afami-cel: A registration directed Phase 2 clinical trial is underway in synovial sarcoma in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. Enrollment in Cohort 1 is complete, and the cohort met its primary endpoint. Subject to the successful filing and approval of a BLA by the FDA we plan to commercially launch afami-cel in the U.S. Cohort 2 of the trial is ongoing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Clinical data was presented at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (“CTOS”) in November 2021. An Overall Response Rate (ORR) per independent review of 34% (36% in patients with synovial sarcoma and 25% for patients with MRCLS) and disease control rate of 85% was reported. The charts below summarize the best overall responses by RECIST v1.1 as of September 1 2021, as per independent review.

The graph represents data from Cohort 1. PR= partial response; SD=stable-disease; PD=progressive disease. Data represent percent changes from baseline in sum of diameters (sum of the long diameters for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) in target lesions through progression or prior to surgical resection. 
​
​
As of September 1 2021, 50 patients had received afami-cel which appeared to be well-tolerated with a favorable benefit:risk profile. The durability of responses is encouraging. 
​
Orphan Drug designation for afami-cel for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas has been granted in the European Union (“EU”) and U.S. together with Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation in the U.S. for the treatment of synovial sarcoma and access to the Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) Regulatory Support initiative by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. 
​

● | SURPASS Phase 1 Trial with ADP-A2M4CD8: Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 1 trial for a next generation SPEAR T-cell, ADP-A2M4CD8 and patients are now being treated in the expansion phase of the trial. This next generation SPEAR T-cell utilizes the same engineered T-cell receptor as afami-cel, but with the addition of a CD8α homodimer. The addition of the CD8α homodimer has been shown in vitro to increase cytokine release and SPEAR T-cell potency. Data from the trial was reported at ESMO in September 2021. As of August 2, 2021, responses (per RECIST 1.1) were seen in five solid tumor indications: a complete response in ovarian cancer and partial responses in ovarian, head and neck, esophagogastric junction, bladder and synovial sarcoma cancers. Most patients treated experienced anti-tumor activity with a disease control rate of 86%. ADP-A2M4CD8 had an acceptable benefit:risk profile in the patients treated as of August 2, 2021. Initial translational data supports ADP-A2M4CD8 being more potent than afami-cel. The chart below illustrates the best overall response seen in patients evaluated as of August 2, 2021.

Other Clinical Programs
​

● | ADP-A2AFP Phase 1 Trial: Our Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial designed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of ADP-A2AFP for the treatment of HCC closed to screening in 2021. We are, however, continuing to focus on the development of new cell therapies to target liver cancer. Data from the ADP-A2AFP trial was reported at the International Liver Congress in August 2021. As of April 5, 2021 thirteen patients with advanced HCC had received ADP-A2AFP in Cohort 3 and expansion phase of the trial. The best overall responses in Cohort 3 and expansion included one complete response, six stable disease and four progressive disease. The disease control rate for patients with at least one scan was 64% (7 out of 11 patients) and two patients had stable disease lasting beyond 16 weeks. ADP-A2AFP had an acceptable benefit:risk profile in the patients treated.

Autologous Preclinical Candidate Pipeline
We believe we have a strong pipeline of cell therapy candidates and we aim to deliver five products to the clinic by 2025. Our current pipeline is illustrated below: 

Our aim is to utilize the insights we obtain from our clinical trials and translational sciences work to improve the efficacy of our existing products and approaches; and to increase the scope of our cell therapies and ability to treat an increasing number of patients. For example, our next generation cell therapies including ADP-A2M4N7X19 (a next-generation SPEAR T-cell product targeting MAGE-A4) and the TIL-IL7 with CCIT are designed to improve efficacy. Whereas the cell therapies directed to alternative HLA types will increase the potentially treatable patients that can be addressed with our cell therapies. 
Allogeneic iPSC Platform
We continue to develop our allogeneic platform which can be used to generate ‘off-the-shelf’ cell therapies that are universally applicable to all eligible patients by developing gene-edited iPSCs differentiated to T-cells by our in-house proprietary process. These “off-the-shelf” cells are being developed to overcome the current limitation of autologous therapies that need to be manufactured specifically for each patient. Additionally, our process starts with iPSCs instead of donor-derived T-cells, which potentially reduces product variability and the need for repeated infusions. 
The enhanced T-cell technology being developed involves selective engineering for the removal of potentially immunogenic cell surface proteins (for example, HLA molecules) and the addition of our TCRs, without the use of nucleases, to develop these T-cell products. If successful, this will enable us to treat our patients with an “off-the-shelf” or on demand cell therapy product without the need to acquire a patient’s own cells. Our first preclinical program is for the development of an allogeneic SPEAR T-cell product directed to the MAGE-A4 target using the same TCR that has been investigated in our current clinical trials. 
We also have two collaboration programs, one with Astellas in which an allogeneic product incorporating a HiT targeting mesothelin is being developed (and a further target has been nominated); and one with Genentech, in which 

8



“off-the-shelf” cell therapies for up to five shared cancer targets (“off the shelf” products) and a novel allogeneic personalized cell therapy platform are being developed.
Integrated Cell Therapy Company
We are committed to building an integrated cell therapy company with a broad range of capabilities that enable the research and development of cell therapies, the translational analyses of clinical responses, control of the manufacturing and supply chain and commercialization. The ability to take learnings from every stage of the process and feed these learnings back into further research and development enables decisions to be taken at the appropriate time and improvements and enhancements to processes and products to be made effectively and in a timely manner.
We have our own autologous cell therapy manufacturing facility at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which is capable of supplying all of our autologous cell therapies currently in the clinic. The Navy Yard facility is increasing its manufacturing capacity to support anticipated commercial launch in the US of afami-cel. We also have our own dedicated vector manufacturing capability in the U.K., within the Catapult Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing Centre in Stevenage, which is now able to produce lentiviral vector for our clinical trials using a suspension process developed by the Company. Additionally, in 2022 we plan to open a new manufacturing facility dedicated to allogeneic drug product manufacturing, and co-located with our research facility in Milton Park in the U.K. 
Control of our own end-to-end manufacturing processes (including vector, T-cell and analytical quality control testing) enables us to improve and further develop these processes for manufacture of our cell therapies. The ability to manufacture in-house provides security of supply at a lower cost than using a third-party provider. In addition, the ability to continually evaluate and optimize processes enables ongoing reduction in the times taken to treat our patients and the overall cost of goods applicable to manufacture and supply of our cell therapies.

COVID-19 and Our Business
During the COVID-19 pandemic we have continued to focus on ensuring the safety of our work force whilst continuing the work we do to make our therapies available to people with cancer. Our facilities in the U.S. and U.K. remained open to support critical manufacturing and scientific activities. We are working with our employees to ensure that they follow guidelines set out by the U.K. and U.S. governments, as well as regional guidance including requirements for social distancing and mask wearing. In addition to safe working practices, we have invested in personal protective equipment and installed screens and other physical measures to enhance the safety of our facilities. 
The pandemic has created challenges for conducting clinical trials and we continue to work with our clinical sites to enroll and treat patients at the earliest possible time particularly given that many of our patients have late-stage cancer. Certain clinical sites have chosen to postpone treatment of patients or participation in trials whilst the pandemic is impacting resources at those sites. We have experienced challenges around our supply chain. Many of the materials and consumables we require for manufacture and supply of products and also for research are also required for manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and as a result these were prioritized to meet vaccine supplies. In certain cases, for example, in accordance with the U.S. Defense Production Act, suppliers were required to prioritize vaccine supplies. This resulted in some delays in supply of materials and consumables we require for our business, however, we were able to mitigate against impacts associated with any supply delays by purchasing in advance where possible, prioritizing use of such supplies and sourcing alternative suppliers where necessary. 
We have continued and will continue to adjust our working practices as the pandemic evolves to ensure we can continue to treat people with cancer as quickly and as effectively as possible whilst protecting the health of our colleagues.
Core Alliances and Collaborations
Genentech Strategic Collaboration and License Agreement 
On September 3, 2021, Adaptimmune Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adaptimmune Therapeutics Plc, entered into a Strategic Collaboration and License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (the “Agreement”). 
​
The collaboration has two components: 

1) | Development of allogeneic T-cell therapies for up to five shared cancer targets
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Development of personalized allogeneic T-cell therapies utilizing αβ T-cell receptors (TCRs) isolated from a patient, with such therapies being administered to the same patient.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The parties will collaborate to perform a research program, initially during an eight-year period (which may be extended for up to two additional two-year terms at Genentech’s election upon payment of an extension fee for each two-year term), to develop the cell therapies, following which Genentech will determine whether to further develop and commercialize such therapies. Under the Agreement, Adaptimmune exclusively licenses to Genentech certain intellectual property rights it controls to enable Genentech to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize (i) off-the-shelf T-cell therapies directed to the collaboration targets and (ii) personalized T-cell therapies developed within the scope of the Agreement, and Genentech is solely responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of any cell therapies arising from the collaboration. Adaptimmune will manufacture and supply cell therapies for Phase 1 trials of off-the-shelf T-cell therapies unless Genentech decides to assume responsibility for such manufacturing.
Under the Agreement, Adaptimmune is also subject to certain restrictions on its ability to further develop and commercialize certain cell therapies. In particular, restrictions apply in relation to its ability to develop cell therapy products to nominated targets and to develop competing personalized cell therapies. This restriction does not prevent Adaptimmune from developing cell therapies to other targets or cell therapies containing different types of receptors. 
​

10



Under the terms of the Agreement, Adaptimmune received a $150 million upfront payment. Adaptimmune may also receive:
​

● | $150 million in additional payments spread over a period of five years from the effective date of the Agreement, unless the Agreement is earlier terminated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | research milestones of up to $50 million;
--+------------------------------------------


● | development milestones of up to $100 million in relation to the development of off-the-shelf T-cell therapies per collaboration target (unless Adaptimmune exercises its right to opt-in to receive a profit share) and up to $200 million in relation to the development of personalized T-cell therapies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | commercialization milestones of up to $1.1 billion for “off-the-shelf” T-cell therapies (unless Adaptimmune exercises its right to opt-in to receive a profit share and assuming off-the-shelf T-cell therapies are developed to five targets) and for personalized T-cell therapies; and

Universal Cells Co-development Collaboration Agreement 
On January 13, 2020, the Company entered into a Co-development and Co-commercialization agreement (the “Astellas Collaboration Agreement”) with Universal Cells, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Universal Cells”).
Under the Astellas Collaboration Agreement the parties will agree on up to three targets and will co-develop T-cell therapies directed to those targets pursuant to an agreed research plan. For each target, Universal Cells will fund co-development up until completion of a Phase 1 trial for products directed to such target. Upon completion of the Phase 1 trial for a product, Universal Cells and Adaptimmune will elect whether to progress with co-development and co-commercialization of such product, or to allow the other party to pursue the candidate independently. The first target program aims to develop an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) mesothelin directed HiT cell therapy. 
In addition, Universal Cells is also granted the right to develop, independently of Adaptimmune, allogeneic T-cell therapy candidates directed to two targets selected by Universal Cells. Universal Cells will have sole rights to develop and commercialize products directed against such products.
​
Under the terms of the agreement, Adaptimmune may receive up to $897.5 million in payments, including:
​

● | an upfront payment of $50 million, which was received in January 2020;

In addition, Universal Cells will receive tiered royalties on net sales in the mid-single to mid-teen digits.
To the extent that Universal Cells and Adaptimmune co-develop and co-commercialize any product, the parties will share equally all worldwide costs and profits. 
In addition to the Astellas Collaboration Agreement, the parties have also entered into an agreement relating to the use of Universal Cells gene editing and HLA-editing technology in the context of the development of our own allogeneic T-cell therapies. Adaptimmune retains exclusive rights in the T-cell field under the agreement.
​
Development and Research Collaborations
GSK Collaboration and License Agreement 
We entered into the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement regarding the development, manufacture and commercialization of TCR therapeutic candidates in May 2014. The collaboration is for up to five programs. The first program was the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program, in relation to which GSK has now exercised its option to take an exclusive license. The second program related to development of a SPEAR T-cell to a peptide derived from the PRAME antigen. This program has now completed. The third target program with GSK remains ongoing and is also directed to the PRAME target. We are responsible for taking the third target program through preclinical testing and up to IND application filing. GSK is responsible for the IND filing itself should the preclinical testing and development be favorable.
​
Preclinical and Clinical Collaborations
We have third party collaborations in place with Noile-Immune, Alpine Immune Sciences and with CCIT.
With Alpine, we are collaborating to develop next-generation SPEAR T-cell products that incorporate Alpine’s secreted and transmembrane immunomodulatory protein technology. The collaboration agreement was announced in May 2019, and we believe that the Alpine technology could complement our existing internal next generation technology and enhance anti-tumor potential through engagement of further rapid and flexible immunomodulatory mechanisms. 
In the Noile-Immune collaboration, announced in August 2019, we will co-develop next-generation SPEAR T-cell products, incorporating Noile-Immune’s PRIME (proliferation inducing and migration enhancing) technology, based upon co-expression of IL-7 and CCL19. 
With CCIT, we are combining CCIT’s existing TIL therapies with our next generation IL-7 construct with the aim of creating enhanced TIL cell therapies. TIL therapy has previously seen efficacy in certain solid tumors including melanoma and the aim is to build on that efficacy. 
We also have a strategic alliance agreement with the MD Anderson Cancer Center which covers both the conduct of certain clinical trials for our SPEAR T-cell therapies and also certain pre-clinical research work.
Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights for our SPEAR T-cells and processes, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain 

12



and maintain patent and other protection including data/market exclusivity for our cell therapies, manufacturing and platform technology, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing an initial priority filing at the U.K. Intellectual Property Office (“UKIPO”) and/or the U.S. Patent Trademark Office (“USPTO”). This is followed by the filing of a patent application under the Patent Co-operation Treaty (“PCT”) claiming priority from the initial application(s) and then application for patent grant in, for example, the U.S., Europe (including major European territories), Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our patent professionals to ensure that we obtain relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and reflect the scope of cell therapies being developed. We will additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including as relevant exclusivity through orphan or pediatric drug designation. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our underlying platform technologies, manufacturing processes and pre-clinical candidates. 
Product Patent Families 
Afami-cel  - We own three patent families covering the composition of matter of ADP-A2M4 and other related TCRs and T-cell therapies. The patent application claims are primarily directed to the engineered TCR therapeutic candidate and in particular the amino acid substitutions required for such engineered TCR therapeutic candidate. National/regional applications have been filed via the PCT in all commercially relevant territories and claims have been allowed in Europe and the US. We project the patents within these families, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, will expire in 2037 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). PCT applications have also been filed in relation to the use of ADP-A2M4 TCR in the treatment of head and neck, lung and ovarian cancers.
ADP-A2M4CD8 – We own a patent family covering the composition of matter of ADP-A2M4CD8 and other related TCR T-cell therapies. The patent application claims are directed to the engineered TCR therapeutic candidate in combination with the CD8 next generation technology. We project the patents within this family, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2039 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). APCT application has also been filed in relation to the use of A2M4CD8 TCR in treatment of esophageal and gastric cancers.
Platform Technology
We own a number of platform technology patents and patent applications which are directed to certain aspects of the process that we use to engineer our SPEAR TCRs and other cell therapies. These are owned jointly with Immunocore Limited, with whom we have historically had a shared development history.
Novel targets - We have filed 28 patent families which cover peptides expressed on the tumor cell surface and the TCRs which recognize them. The applications as filed cover multiple peptides from multiple different target proteins. National/regional applications have been filed in all commercially relevant territories.
TCR libraries - We have filed two patent families which cover large libraries of TCR genes which we have generated and the method of their generation: these act as proprietary sources for screening for TCRs, which are the starting points for affinity engineering into clinical candidates. National/regional applications have been filed in all commercially relevant territories.
We also have patents or patent applications directed to our phage display technology, decreasing off-target reactivity and selection for the affinity-enhanced TCRs.

13



Manufacturing Process Patents and Patent Applications
We have trade secrets and patent applications relating to the manufacture of our cell therapies. For example, we have filed patent applications in commercially relevant territories, which claim priority from initial priority patent applications filed at the USPTO and UKIPO, which are directed to a particular modification to the lentiviral vector technology. We believe this modification enhances the safety profile of the lentiviral vector technology. This has been granted in the U.S,. Further patent applications have been filed on the manufacturing and quality control of our products.
Preclinical and Next Generation Approaches
We have filed four patent families covering a range of next generation technology approaches and/or combination approaches. 
Allogeneic iPSC Platform Approaches
We have filed a number of patent applications covering our proprietary iPSC stem cell differentiation technology which enables the differentiation of stem cells into T-cells which can then be administered to patients. The patent applications are primarily directed to the various stages required for the differentiation of the iPSC stem cells into different cell line types including NK cells, NKT cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and T-cells. The earliest of these applications have now been filed as PCT applications and will be pursued in all commercially relevant territories. Patent protection is projected to extend to 2040 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
 Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights
We have a non-exclusive license from ThermoFisher Inc. under certain of its intellectual property rights covering its Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology. This technology is used in our manufacturing process to isolate, activate and expand patient T-cells. We also have a supply agreement which runs until December 31, 2025. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third Parties—We rely heavily on ThermoFisher and the technology we license from them.”
Whether licenses are required under any third-party patents depends on what steps we take going forward in relation to our manufacturing processes, development processes and development products including our allogeneic manufacturing and differentiation process. We may need to negotiate a license under any third-party patents or develop alternative strategies for dealing with any third party patents if licenses are not available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and intense competition. Competitors include large pharmaceutical companies with established development and commercialization programs, small and large biotechnology companies with varying development and commercialization capabilities and academic centers developing novel technologies and products. 
​
We face competition in all of the following areas:
​

(a) | From other cell therapies: There are a number of other cell therapies which have already received marketing approval or which are currently in late stage clinical trials. These include CAR-T therapies, for example, Kymriah™ (tisagenlecleucel) and Yescarta™ (axicabtagene ciloleucel) which have received marketing approval in hematological malignancies, TIL cell therapies, for example, Iovance’s TIL therapy which is in late stage clinical trials and cell therapies, or other products directed to the peptide-HLA complex (pHLA). These cell therapies are being developed in both solid and hematological indications.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(b) | From other T-cell therapies: Third parties and academic institutions are developing TCR-based cell therapies which are directed to a multitude of shared targets including HPV-16 E6/E7, KRAS, MAGE-A1, 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14




MAGE-A3, MAGE A3/A6, MAGE-A4, MART1, NRAS, NY-ESO-1, p53, PRAME, mesothelin, as well as personalized neoantigen targets. These cell therapies are at a variety of preclinical and clinical development stage. There are additionally third parties with T-cell therapy platforms capable of generating multiple TCR T-cell therapies or cell therapies potentially directed to multiple targets or cell therapies which utilize T-cells and the immune system in similar ways, such as TRuC T-cells being developed by TCR2 Therapeutics. Examples include Medigene AG’s PRAME TCR therapeutic candidate (MDG1011), which has begun a Phase 1/2 clinical investigation in AML, MM and myelodysplastic syndromes and Immatics N.V. which has several engineered TCR T-cell therapies in Phase 1 clinical trials for solid tumors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(c) | From other cell-based immunotherapy approaches: The immune system utilizes a number of different cell types and processes. Other immunotherapy approaches may target different parts of the immune system including different types of T-cells (for example, gamma delta T-cells), macrophage based systems, NK-cell based products, Marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) and virus-specific T-cells.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(d) | From other therapeutic product types. In any indication that we address there may be multiple other product modalities which are already being marketed and where we will have to show increased benefit to patients, or which are in clinical trials. Where products receive approval and start being used within the patient setting, such products can also impact our ability to complete clinical development and obtain information around the safety and efficacy of our own products.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Where we see competition in any indication and a competitor receives marketing approval before our cell therapy, we will need to demonstrate increased efficacy over the competing product. We may also see competition in relation to areas that are still in research and development. For example, allogeneic approaches to cell therapies are being developed by multiple third parties, for example, Fate Therapeutics Inc., Allogene Therapeutics and Takeda Pharmaceuticals Limited. Given the potential advantage such therapies have over autologous cell therapy products, such approaches may increasingly impact our ability to further develop and progress with our cell therapies which is why we have focused on also developing our own equivalent “off-the-shelf” products in parallel.
​
Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU and U.K, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the various federal, state and local level laws and requirements can also result in severe penalties and restrictions to the business.
FDA Approval Process 
In the U.S., therapeutic products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Some biological products are subject to regulation under the FDC Act. Most biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) via a BLA. The application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are generally similar to those for new drug applications (“NDAs”), and biologics are associated with generally similar, if not greater, approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

15



Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An Investigational Review Board (“IRB”) may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S.. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls as well as proposed labeling for the product. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the FDA receives the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA receives the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. 

16



Expedited Pathways
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life- threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. These expedited programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and RMAT designation (Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation), accelerated approval, and priority review designation. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or efficacy supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, a sponsor that qualifies for “pediatric exclusivity” is entitled to an additional six months of market exclusivity if it complies with a Written Request, or WR, issued by FDA for pediatric studies. The sponsor may apply to FDA to issue a WR. Pediatric exclusivity may apply to patent rights and to FDA regulatory exclusivity and operates by adding six months of exclusivity on to the end of the latest-expiring form of exclusivity. To qualify for pediatric exclusivity, at least one of those rights must still be currently in force at the time FDA approves the pediatric studies.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of 

17



the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Biosimilars
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, a biological product may be deemed biosimilar to an FDA-approved biological product or reference biological product upon a showing that there are no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. 
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of marketing exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, which includes four years from the date of licensure of the reference product during which no application for a biosimilar can be submitted. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain marketing approval through the pre-market approval (“PMA”) process for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
The PMA process involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. In addition, PMAs for certain 

18



devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. 
Successful PMA approval is uncertain, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA finds the PMA application is approvable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Act amended the federal false claims law such that a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
Various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the environment and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research are applicable to our activities. They include, among others, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, import, export, and customs regulations, and other present and possible future local, state, or federal regulation. 
​
European Union, UK and Rest of the World Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions both due to the location of our facilities and the fact that we are engaging in clinical programs outside of the U.S. and will need to obtain worldwide regulatory approval for our TCR therapeutic candidates. In particular we have clinical trials ongoing in 

19



the United Kingdom and in certain countries in the European Union (“EU”) and are subject to regulations relating to performance of those clinical trials and manufacture and supply of our cell therapies in those countries. Prior to supplying any cell therapy in any country or starting any clinical trials in any country outside of the U.S. we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in such countries. The existence of a U.S. regulatory approval does not guarantee that regulatory approvals will be obtained in other countries in which we wish to conduct clinical trials or market our cell therapies. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively prior to any clinical trial being conducted in the relevant country. A marketing authorization application is then submitted to the EMA for approval by the European Commission. Finally, prior to any commercial supply, a pricing and reimbursement application is submitted to each relevant country’s national or local health authority(ies).
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. However, the interpretation of these requirements may well differ from country to country.
Review and Approval of Drug Products Outside of the U.S.
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Procedures Governing Approval of Products in the EU and U.K.
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. A clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. Similar approval requirements apply in the UK and a clinical trial application must be made to the UK regulatory authority (MHRA) prior to starting any clinical trial.
To obtain marketing approval of a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the scientific assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. For advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), the scientific 

20



evaluation of MAA is primarily performed by the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT). The CAT prepares a draft opinion of each ATMP subject to a MAA which is sent for final approval to the CHMP. 
Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. Then, the European Commission grants or refuses the marketing authorization, following a procedure that involves representatives of the member states. Although the CHMP's opinion is not binding, the Commission's decision to grant or refuse the market authorization is frequently in accordance with the CHMP's assessment except in very rare cases. For marketing approval in the U.K, an application for marketing approval will be made for the MHRA and follows a similar process to that used in the EU.
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state or in the U.K. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
As a result of Brexit, as of January 1, 2021, marketing authorizations granted on the basis of a centralized procedure in the EU are only valid in Northern Ireland, but not in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). However, prior EU authorizations have all been automatically converted into U.K. marketing authorizations effective in Great Britain. UK rules require marketing authorization holders to be established in the U.K. or in the EU/European Economic Area. EU rules require marketing authorization holders to be established in the EU/European Economic Area and, in addition, that certain activities be performed in the EU, related for example to pharmacovigilance, batch release and quality control. Marketing authorization holders may need to take steps to comply with these requirements aiming at holding both a EU and a U.K. marketing authorization.
With regard to the sunset clause, from the perspective of the U.K, the period of three years during which the drug has not been marketed in Great Britain will be restarted from the date of conversion to a Great Britain marketing authorization. From the perspective of the EU, in case the drug has been marketed in the U.K, the placing on the U.K. market before the end of the Brexit transition period will be taken into account. If, after the end of the Brexit transition period, the drug is not placed on any other market of the remaining member states of the EU, the three year period for the sunset clause will start running from the last date the drug was placed on the U.K. market before the end of the Brexit transition period. 
Legal Proceedings and Related Matters
From time to time, we may be party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 494 employees. Of these employees, 366 were in research and development (including in manufacturing and operations, and quality control and quality assurance) and 128 were in management and administrative functions (including business development, finance, intellectual property, information technology and 

21



general administration). We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. 
We value our employees and as a company work hard to employ those individuals that will work with us to achieve the objectives of the Company and share our values. We engage with our employees in multiple ways including through companywide business meetings, social events and smaller team events. We employ individuals based on their experience and ability to perform the applicable job and encourage diversity in our workforce whenever possible. We have an equal opportunities policy which promotes the right of every employee to be treated with dignity and respect and not to be harassed or bullied on any grounds. We employ individuals from approximately 29 different nationalities within our U.K. and U.S. offices and are working to encourage diversity within our workforce. During 2021, we established a Diversity and Inclusion Council with membership comprising diverse employees from all levels in the Company. A Diversity and Inclusion Plan has been created and championed across the business by the CEO and executive team and presented to the Board. D&I progress updates are reviewed regularly by the Board Remuneration Committee.
We have a performance-based reward scheme, bonus scheme and share option plan which all employees are entitled to participate in. These schemes and other employee incentive programs are designed to retain employees. Over 2021, the total global attrition rate was 19.5% and we continually work to keep attrition to a minimum.
