PCTEL maintains expertise in the following areas: radio frequency engineering, DSP engineering, wireless network engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, and product quality and testing.  
 Our test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers, engineering companies, or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.  Competitors for our test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Viavi, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.  PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the test tool market. 
 
Discontinued Operations
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Service business (“Engineering Services”) and shifted our focus toward research and development driven RF products. On July 31, 2017, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million in cash. The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks. We classified assets of the Engineering Services business as held for sale at December 31, 2017 and reported the results of its operations as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The financial information presented in this annual report on Form 10-K reflects the historical results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations. See Note 3 in the notes to the financial statements for more information on discontinued operations.
 Reorganization and Segment Reporting
 Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the industrial IIoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (“the Reorganization”). Our operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assesses operating profits and identifies assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations. In connection with the Reorganization, in the place of general managers for each segment, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the Company’s entire businesses. All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.  The balance sheet and cash flows were already managed centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of accounts receivable and inventory, and now as a result of the Reorganization, those assets are also managed at the corporate level. 
 
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions.  We are reporting our financial condition and results of operations as one segment beginning with this annual report on Form 10-K; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products).  In order to understand our financial results, it is necessary to understand the impact on gross profit margin of the revenue mix between the two product lines. 
 Major Customers
 There were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017.
 The following table represents customers that accounted for 10% or more of total trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 2017:
 
 
 | As of December 31,
--------------------------+-------------------
Trade Accounts Receivable | 2018 | 2017
Customer A | 13% | 12% 

Backlog
 Sales of our products are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders, which are officially acknowledged according to standard terms and conditions.  The backlog of customer purchase orders is useful for scheduling production but is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future product revenues as the order to ship cycle is short.
Research and Development
 Given that the Company’s mission is to solve complex RF problems for our customers, research and development is essential to our long-term success. We work closely with our customers, consultants and market research organizations to monitor and predict changes in the wireless industry, including emerging industry standards.  We continue to make substantial investments in engineering, talent,

research and development and we devote substantial resources to product development, innovation, and patent submissions.  We have over 100 patents in the U.S. and countries worldwide.  The patent submissions are primarily for defensive purposes, rather than for potential license revenue generation.  
 Sales, Marketing and Support
 Our marketing strategy is focused on building market awareness and acceptance of our new products.  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company combined its sales functions under a single Chief Sales Officer and has focused on sharing best sales practices and software tools company-wide to execute on our marketing strategy. PCTEL’s direct sales force is technologically sophisticated with many sales personnel having college degrees in engineering, and sales executives having strong industry domain knowledge.  We supply our products to public and private carriers, wireless infrastructure providers, wireless equipment distributors, value added resellers (“VARs”) and OEMs. Our direct sales force supports the sales efforts of our distributors and OEM resellers.
Manufacturing
 PCTEL has historically done final assembly of most of our antenna products in-house at our facilities in Bloomingdale, Illinois and Tianjin, China and final assembly of all and all of our OEM receiver and interference management product lines in-house at our facility in Germantown, Maryland. In order to optimize the cost structure of our antenna product line and increase our competitiveness, we have engaged with several contract manufacturers over the last several years and are in the process of transitioning several product lines from our Tianjin facility to additional contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere over the next two years.  As a result of using multiple contract manufacturers with a variety of expertise, we will avoid becoming dependent on any specific contract manufacturer.  If any of our contract manufacturers are unable to provide satisfactory services for us, other contract manufacturers are available, although transitioning a new contract manufacturer could cause delays, disruption and additional costs and could negatively impact our timely delivery of products.  We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers, but we do have open purchase orders with several of our suppliers.  See the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section of Note 7 for information on purchase commitments.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 454 full-time equivalent employees, consisting of 324 in operations, 55 in research and development, 42 in sales and marketing, and 33 in general and administrative functions.  Total full-time equivalent employees were 484 at December 31, 2017.  Headcount decreased by 30 at December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily due a reduction in force related to the U.S. workforce.  None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union.  All of our employees in Tianjin, China are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of China’s National Labor Law.  These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights.  As indicated in the section titled “Manufacturing” above, we are in the process of transitioning the final assembly of some of our antenna products to contract manufacturers, resulting in a reduction of a significant portion of our workforce in Tianjin, China.  We are negotiating severance arrangements for those workers.
