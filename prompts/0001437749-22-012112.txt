ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General
 
Park Aerospace Corp. (“Park”), and its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise requires, Park and its subsidiaries are hereinafter called the “Company”), is an aerospace company which develops and manufactures solution and hot-melt advanced composite materials used to produce composite structures for the global aerospace markets.  Park’s advanced composite materials include film adhesives (undergoing qualification) and lightning strike materials.  Park offers an array of composite materials specifically designed for hand lay-up or automated fiber placement (AFP) manufacturing applications.  Park’s advanced composite materials are used to produce primary and secondary structures for jet engines, large and regional transport aircraft, military aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs commonly referred to as “drones”), business jets, general aviation aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.  Park also offers specialty ablative materials for rocket motors and nozzles and specially designed materials for radome applications.  As a complement to Park’s advanced composite materials offering, Park designs and fabricates composite parts, structures and assemblies and low-volume tooling for the aerospace industry.  Target markets for Park’s composite parts and structures (which include Park’s proprietary composite SigmaStrut™ and AlphaStrut™ product lines) are, among others, prototype and development aircraft, special mission aircraft, spares for legacy military and civilian aircraft and exotic spacecraft. Park’s core capabilities are in the areas of polymer chemistry formulation and coating technology.
 
On January 5, 2022 Park announced that it entered into a Business Partner Agreement with ArianeGroup SAS of Les Mureaux, France.  Under the Business Partner Agreement, ArianeGroup SAS appointed Park as its exclusive North American distributor of ArianeGroup’s RAYCARB C2®B NG proprietary product.  RAYCARB C2®B NG is used to produce ablative composite materials for critical rocketry and missile systems.
 
Park is a long-term customer of ArianeGroup and uses ArianeGroup’s RAYCARB C2®B NG product in the production of many of Park’s key ablative materials which Park supplies into critical rocket and missile programs.  Park will continue to purchase RAYCARB C2®B NG for its own programs, and, through the Business Partner Agreement, Park is now taking on the new role of ArianeGroup’s exclusive North American distributor for its RAYCARB C2®B product.
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and has since spread worldwide, including to the United States (the “U.S.”), posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of the Company’s employees, suppliers, customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as the end users of aircraft manufactured by OEMs served by the Company.  Park’s manufacturing operations were deemed essential by the Federal Government of the United States and by the State of Kansas, and the Company continued to actively work with federal, state and local government officials to ensure that we continue to satisfy their requirements for continuing our manufacturing operations. The continued operation of the Company’s Kansas facility is critically dependent on maintaining the wellbeing of the employees that staff the facility. The Company provided all employees at its manufacturing facility with detailed health and safety literature on COVID-19. In addition, the Company’s procurement and safety teams updated and developed new safety-oriented guidelines to support daily operations, and the Company provides appropriate personal protection equipment to its employees. The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted Park financially. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of Part II of this Report. The Company believes its balance sheet and financial condition to be very strong, and the Company believes it is well positioned to weather the impact of the Pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, global passenger air travel decreased dramatically, precipitating production rate cuts for many commercial aerospace programs and business jet/general aviation programs which the Company supports. The military aerospace end market has not experienced this same production rate decline but would also be at risk as it relates to uncertainty about suppliers and employee health.

Industry Background
 
The aerospace composite materials manufactured by the Company and its competitors are used primarily to fabricate light-weight, high-strength structures with specifically designed performance properties. Composite materials are typically highly specified combinations of resin formulations and reinforcements. Reinforcements can be unidirectional fibers, woven fabrics, or non-woven goods such as mats or felts. Resin formulations are typically highly proprietary, and include various chemical and physical mixtures. The Company produces resin formulations using various epoxies, polyesters, phenolics, cyanate esters, polyimides and other complex matrices. The reinforcement combined with the resin is referred to as a “prepreg”. Aerospace composite materials can be broadly categorized as either thermosets or thermoplastics. While both material types require the addition of heat to form a consolidated laminate, thermoplastics can be reformed using additional heat. Once fully cured, thermoset materials cannot be further reshaped. The Company believes that the demand for thermoset advanced materials is greater than that for thermoplastics due to the fact that parts fabrication processes for continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastics require much higher temperatures and pressures and are, therefore, typically more capital intensive than parts fabrication processes for most thermoset materials.
 
The Company works with aerospace OEMs, such as general aviation aircraft manufacturers and commercial aircraft manufacturers, and certain tier 1 suppliers to qualify its aerospace composite materials or structures and assemblies for use on current and upcoming programs. The Company’s customers typically design and specify a material specifically to meet the requirements of the customer’s application and processing methods. Such customers sometimes work with a supplier to develop the specific resin system and reinforcement combination to match the application. Composite structure fabrication methods may include hand lay-up, resin infusion or more advanced automated lay-up processes. Automated lay-up processes include automated tape lay-up, automated fiber placement and filament winding. These automated fabrication processes required different material formats but similar materials to hand lay-up. After the lay-up process is completed, the material is cured by the addition of heat and pressure. Cure and consolidation processes typically include vacuum bag/oven curing, high pressure autoclave and press forming. After the structure has been cured, final finishing and trimming, and assembly of the structure, is performed by the fabricator or the Company.

Manufacturing 
 
The Company’s manufacturing facilities for aerospace composite materials and for composite structures and assemblies are located in Newton, Kansas. On August 19, 2019, the Company broke ground on the expansion of its facilities located in Newton, Kansas, which included the construction of a redundant manufacturing facility located adjacent to the existing facility.  The 90,000 square feet expansion essentially doubled the size of the Company’s existing Newton, Kansas facilities.  The new facility was originally conceived of as a redundant manufacturing facility for Park’s major aerospace customer and the large aerospace OEMs it supports, but it will also support additional manufacturing capacity. The expansion includes enhanced and upgraded hot-melt film and tape lines and mixing and delivery systems, an expanded production lab, a new R&D lab, additional freezer and storage space and additional infrastructure to support the expanded operation. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. See “Operations” elsewhere in this Report.
 
The process for manufacturing composite materials, structures and assemblies is capital intensive and requires sophisticated equipment, significant technical know-how and very tight process controls. The key steps used in the manufacturing process include resin mixing, resin film casting and reinforcement impregnation via hot-melt process or a solution process.
 
Prepreg is manufactured by the Company using either solvent (solution) coating methods on a treater or by hot-melt impregnation. A solution treater is a roll-to-roll continuous process machine which sequences reinforcement through tension controllers and combines solvated resin with the reinforcement. The reinforcement is dipped in resin, passed through a drying oven which removes most of the solvent and advances (or partially cures) the resin. The prepreg material is interleafed with a carrier and cut to the roll lengths desired by the customer. The Company also manufactures prepreg using hot-melt impregnation methods which use no solvent. Hot-melt prepreg manufacturing is achieved by mixing a resin formulation in a heated resin vessel, casting a thin film on a carrier paper, and laminating the reinforcement with the resin film.

The Company also completes additional processing services, such as slitting, sheeting, biasing, sewing and cutting, if needed by the customer. Many of the products manufactured by the Company also undergo extensive testing of the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the product. These testing requirements are completed in the laboratories and facilities located at the Company’s manufacturing facilities.
 
Once the manufacturing process has been completed, the product is tested and packaged for shipment to the customer.  The Company typically supplies final product to the customer in roll form.
 
The Company’s laboratories have been approved by several aerospace OEMs, and the Company has achieved certification pursuant to the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (“NADCAP”) for both non-metallic materials manufacturing and testing and composites fabrication. The Company believes its Newton Kansas facility is one of the few facilities in the world with NADCAP accreditation for manufacturing both composite materials and composite structures.  The Company has also received AS9100C certification for its quality management system for the manufacture of advanced composite materials and design and manufacturing of structures for aircraft and aerospace industries.
 
Materials and Sources of Supply
 
The Company designs and manufactures its aerospace composite materials to its own specifications and to the specifications of its customers. Product development efforts are focused on developing prepreg materials that meet the specifications of the customers. The materials used in the manufacture of these engineered materials include graphite and carbon fibers and fabrics, carbonized rayon, aramids, such as Kevlar® ("Kevlar" is a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.) and Twaron® (“Twaron” is a registered trademark of Teijin Twaron B.V. LLC), quartz, fiberglass, polyester, specialty chemicals, resins, films, plastics, adhesives and certain other synthetic materials. The Company purchases these materials from several suppliers. Substitutes for many of these materials are not readily available. The qualification and certification of aerospace composite materials for certain FAA certified aircraft typically include specific requirements for raw material supply and may restrict the Company’s flexibility in qualifying alternative sources of supply for certain key raw materials. The Company continues to work to determine acceptable alternatives for several raw materials.
 
Competition
 
The Company has many competitors in the aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies markets, ranging in size from large international corporations to small regional producers. Several of the Company’s largest competitors are vertically integrated, producing raw materials, such as carbon fiber and woven fabric, as well as composite structures and assemblies. Some of the Company’s competitors may also serve as a supplier to the Company. The Company competes for business primarily on the basis of responsiveness, product performance and consistency, product qualification, FAA data base design allowables and innovative new product development.

Backlog
 
The Company considers an item as backlog when it receives a purchase order specifying the number of units to be purchased, the purchase price, specifications and other customary terms and conditions. At April 25, 2022, the unfilled portion of all purchase orders received by the Company, and believed by it to be firm, was $25,895,809, compared to $21,326,751 at April 26, 2021. A major portion of the Company’s backlog consists of composite materials.
 
Various factors contribute to the size of the Company’s backlog. Accordingly, the foregoing information may not be indicative of the Company’s results of operations for any period subsequent to the fiscal year ended February 27, 2022.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company holds several patents and trademarks or licenses thereto. In the Company’s opinion, some of these patents and trademarks are important to its products. Generally, however, the Company does not believe that an inability to obtain new; or to defend existing, patents and trademarks would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Company’s Workforce
 
At February 27, 2022, the Company had 110 employees. The Company’s success and future depends on the skills, experience, industry knowledge, passion and dedication of its work force. The Company places significant focus and attention on attracting, developing and retaining its employees, as well as ensuring its work force reflects Park’s principles of integrity and humility. These principles ensure that every Park employee is held to his or her word, and that every Park employee continuously strives to excel. These two principles guide Park’s actions, and the Company believes, foster a healthy work environment where all Park employees are treated with dignity and respect, irrespective of their backgrounds. The Company also believes that its principles are critical to fostering and maintaining what it calls Park’s “niche” culture of doing what others are unwilling or unable to do.
 
Employee health and safety is a top priority. Park’s safety performance has been an important focus of the Company. Safety performance is maintained by the Company ensuring appropriate safety equipment is installed and operational at all times and undertaking thorough reviews of any safety incidents that do occur.
 
The Company takes a comprehensive approach to developing its workforce, including by striving to use a fair recruiting process to select talented individuals. Park also believes that fair compensation, opportunities for career development, employee engagement, and a singular focus on the principles of integrity and humility, have organically cultivated a workforce that is diverse at all levels. Park believes that principle-based approach to hiring and retention makes the Company a desirable workplace for employees of all backgrounds while improving business performance by maintaining the Company’s “niche” culture.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of the greenhouse gas emissions. Air travel is also considered to be one of the most carbon intensive activity an individual can make. As air travel rebounds from the COVID-19 Pandemic and gradually returns to its aggressive pre-pandemic growth trajectory, aircraft fuel efficiency will return to being an increasingly important factor in addressing the reduction of greenhouse gas. Park’s composite material products and the aircraft parts that are crafted using such products, enable aircraft to operate on substantially less fuel than would be the case using comparable aluminum-crafted aircraft parts. This reduced fuel consumption creates economic savings for end-users of applicable aircraft, while also substantially reducing the carbon based emissions of such aircraft.
 
    10 

  

The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation of its use, storage, treatment, disposal of hazardous materials and the release of emissions into the environment. The Company believes that it currently is in substantial compliance with the applicable Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations to which it is subject and that continuing compliance therewith will not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. The Company does not currently anticipate making material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for its existing manufacturing operations during the remainder of its current fiscal year or its succeeding fiscal year. However, developments, such as the enactment or adoption of even more stringent environmental laws and regulations, could conceivably result in substantial additional costs to the Company.
 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or a comparable state agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund Act”) or similar state law as potentially responsible parties in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at three sites.
 
Under the Superfund Act and similar state laws, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste disposal site or contaminated area identified by the EPA or comparable state agency may be jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup. Generally, these sites are locations at which numerous persons disposed of hazardous waste. In the case of the Company’s subsidiaries, generally the waste was removed from their manufacturing facilities and disposed at the waste sites by various companies which contracted with the subsidiaries to provide waste disposal services. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been accused of or charged with any wrongdoing or illegal acts in connection with any such sites. The Company believes it maintains an effective and comprehensive environmental compliance program. Management believes the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, capital resources, business, consolidated results of operations or financial position of the Company.
