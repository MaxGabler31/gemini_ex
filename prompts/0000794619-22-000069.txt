Item 1.        BUSINESS
Our Company
American Woodmark Corporation ("American Woodmark," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division. We operated privately until 1986 when we became a public company through a registered public offering of common stock.
From design to installation, we believe we offer a higher level of service than our competitors, serving both national and regional markets with the most relevant options. This makes us the cabinetmaker of choice for many homeowners, builders, designers, dealers, distributors, and retailers across the country. Our customer base is expanding as we build our portfolio of brands and reach new markets beyond kitchen and bath. Aspirational yet grounded, we've embraced an ambitious, strategic vision that will advance us boldly into the future.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website, americanwoodmark.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our Business
American Woodmark celebrates the creativity in all of us. With over 10,000 employees and more than a dozen brands, we're one of the nation's largest cabinet manufacturers. From inspiration to installation, we help people find their unique style and turn their home into a space for self-expression. By partnering with major home centers, builders, and dealers, we spark the imagination of homeowners and designers and bring their vision to life. Across our service and distribution centers, our corporate office and manufacturing facilities, you'll always find the same commitment to customer satisfaction, integrity, teamwork, and excellence. 
Our Products 
We offer a wide variety of products that fall into product lines including kitchen cabinetry, bath cabinetry, office cabinetry, home organization and hardware. Our cabinetry products are available in a variety of designs, finishes and finish colors and door styles. 
We offer products in the following categories: made-to-order and stock. Made-to-order products typically utilize higher grade materials with more options as compared to stock and are all special ordered and shipped directly to the home from the factory. Our home organization products are exclusively stock products. Our kitchen cabinetry and bath cabinetry are offered across all product categories (made-to-order and stock) and our office cabinetry is offered as stock. Our stock products represent cash and carry products and are sold through home centers, while our made-to-order products are sold through home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors. 
Our Market 
Our products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets. We service these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors. We distribute our products to each market channel directly from our assembly plants and through a third party logistics network.
Our Customers 
We serve three main categories of customers: home center customers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors. 
Home Center Customers 
Contractors, builders, remodelers, and do-it-yourself homeowners use our products primarily for repair and remodel ("R&R") projects. Products for R&R projects are predominately purchased through home centers such as Home Depot and Lowe's. Due to the market presence, store network and customer reach of these large home centers, our strategy has been to develop long-term strategic relationships with both Home Depot and Lowe's to distribute our products. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 
2022 ("fiscal 2022"), Home Depot and Lowe's combined accounted for approximately 48.0% of net sales of the Company. The loss of either Home Depot or Lowe's as a customer would have a material adverse effect on us.
Builders
The builder business represents a large portion of our overall revenue and has historically been a strategic component of our go-to-market strategy. We serve the majority of the top U.S. builders with a high degree of geographic concentration around major metro areas where single family starts are most robust. We also serve multi-family builders, primarily in the Southwest Region of the U.S. Our various service center locations are close to these builders and enable us to deliver exceptional service to our builder partners. During fiscal 2022, builders accounted for approximately 39.3% of net sales of the Company.
Independent Dealers & Distributors
In 2010, we expanded our business into the dealer channel with the launch of the Waypoint Living Spaces® brand. Today, we sell this brand to over 1,800 regional and local dealers across the country. The dealer channel of the market is the largest by volume, characterized by a high degree of entrepreneurship and one that rewards suppliers that deliver great service. Our ability to provide superior value delivered with exceptional service has helped drive our expansion into this channel and this channel will continue to be a strong growth and market share opportunity for us. Within our distributor channel we also sell our Timberlake® brand through a network of regional distributors who are focused on selling a complete variety of building materials to small and midsized builders and contractors within their local markets. During fiscal 2022, independent dealers and distributors accounted for approximately 12.7% of net sales of the Company.  
Manufacturing, Distribution and Service 
Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located to serve our customers, which enhances our ability to provide high quality, value priced products with low production costs. We manufacture our products across 17 facilities located in Maryland, Indiana, West Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky, Virginia, California, Texas, North Carolina, and Tijuana, Mexico. The geographic distribution of our facilities throughout the United States, together with our third party logistics network for the American Woodmark business and beneficial freight arrangements with home centers, enable us to provide a "short supply chain" to our U.S. customers. The ordering patterns of Home Depot and Lowe's, our two biggest customers, require suppliers to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand and to serve a large number (frequently hundreds to thousands) of stores. They impose strict logistics and performance criteria on us. The scale and strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities help us to meet these demands of the home center customers, as well as provide a logistics platform that we can leverage for builders and dealers. We distribute our products through one stand-alone distribution center, distribution centers located in some of our manufacturing facilities, and other third party locations to maximize efficiency. Our vertically-integrated production and assembly lines, standardized product construction, and investments in automation have allowed us to continuously improve productivity, and develop an expertise in wood processing and yield-maximizing technologies. We have standardized our raw material inputs and a number of our production processes, which reduces logistical requirements to manufacture and gives us increased economies of scale in sourcing these inputs. Certain of our inputs are also partially processed by our vendors, which reduces cost. In addition, our production of labor-intensive manufacturing and fabrication processes in our three Tijuana, Mexico facilities has enabled us to keep overall labor costs low while maintaining higher quality, greater speed-to-market and transportation cost advantage over Asian based manufacturers. 
We provide complete turnkey installation services to our direct builder customers via our network of eight primary service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States in Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Arizona and California. 
We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and supply chains and assess opportunities to reduce costs and enhance quality. We strive to improve quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage cost inflation, including wages and employee medical costs. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers 
The primary raw materials used in our products include hard maple, cherry, and beech lumber and plywood. Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, high density fiberboard, manufactured components, and hardware. We purchase these and other raw materials from more than one source and generally believe them to be readily available. We rely on outside suppliers for some of our key components and do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners. We source a portion of our components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in these arrangements, together with the differences in business practices, shipping and delivery requirements, and laws and 
regulations add complexity to our supply chain logistics and increase the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling. In addition, prices and availability of these components may be affected by world market conditions and government policies and tariffs that impacted fiscal 2022 and may continue into fiscal 2023.
Competition 
We operate in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers. Most of our competitors compete on a local or regional basis, but others, like us, compete on a national basis as well. Our competitors include importers and large consolidated operations as well as relatively small, local cabinet manufacturers. Moreover, companies in other building products industries may compete with us. Competitive factors within the industry include pricing, quality, product availability, service, delivery time, and relationships with customers. Our principal means for competition is our breadth and variety of product offerings, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach, competitive price points for our products, and affordable quality. We believe we are a top three manufacturer of kitchen, bath, and home organization products in the United States based on publicly available information.
Environmental Matters and Regulatory Matters 
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation, and discharge of regulated materials into the environment. Permits are required for certain of our operations, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines or the entry of injunctions, or both. We may also incur liabilities for investigation and clean-up of soil or groundwater contamination on or emanating from current or formerly owned and operated properties, or at offsite locations at which regulated materials are located where we are identified as a responsible party. Discovery of currently unknown conditions could require responses that could result in significant costs. 
Intellectual Property 
We maintain trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. We sell many of our products under a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in our industry. We rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position. If we must litigate to protect our rights, we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations. To date, we have not relied on material patents in operating our business. 
Seasonality 
Our business has been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. General economic forces and changes in our customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years and this trend is expected to continue. The costs of the Company's products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations. The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases, although, as we experienced in fiscal 2022 and continue to experience, there usually is a 6-9 month lag before our sales price increases catch up to such fluctuations.
Human Capital Resources
Employees 
As of April 30, 2022, we employed over 10,000 full-time employees, with approximately 271 unionized employees in Anaheim, California. We believe that our employee relations and relationship with the union representing the employees in Anaheim are good. 
Culture and Core Values
At American Woodmark, the way we conduct our business and interact with our customers, vendors, and the communities in which we operate is driven by our core principles of Customer Satisfaction, Integrity, Teamwork, and Excellence. These principles also guide our interactions with employees and serve as a basis for setting goals for and evaluating our employees. By living out these principles, we believe we will be best positioned to attract, develop, and promote a broad range of talent and 
to conduct our business in a responsible, ethical, and professional manner. To that end, we have, among other things, established policies under which we strive to:
•Engage with our key stakeholders, including employees, to ensure their needs and concerns are heard and addressed, and if appropriate, incorporated into our strategy;
•Maintain a safe and enriching working environment where all employees are treated with respect and are able to achieve their full potential;
•Encourage employees to volunteer in our communities through internally or externally organized events; 
•Fund the American Woodmark Foundation, which serves as a vehicle for our employees to serve the community; and 
•Provide scholarship opportunities to family members for our employees.
Training
Training is an important part of attracting and retaining a qualified workforce. Through our training programs, we seek to ensure that each employee is engaged, and has opportunities to succeed and advance his or her career. We invest a significant number of hours annually in onboarding, cultural, safety, supervisory, and managerial training activities. Through these activities, as well as our tuition reimbursement programs, executive development opportunities, formal and informal cross-training activities, and other operational training offerings, we strive to establish American Woodmark as an organization dedicated to providing the training and development opportunities necessary to maintain a well-qualified workforce connected to and invested in our continued operational success.
Our training is designed and developed at the corporate and local level in order to further our goals of enterprise alignment and local integration. We prefer a leader-led approach to training whenever possible in order to foster engagement, relationship building, networking, and shared learning experiences. Depending on the course, our training and development opportunities are offered on an on-demand, semi-annual, annual, or biannual basis.
Safety
We have established comprehensive safety programs throughout our operations to provide our employees with the tools they need to comply with the safety standards established under federal, state, and local laws and regulations or independently by us. Our safety leadership teams monitor our safety programs and related benchmarking with the goal of improving safety across the Company. Our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) per one hundred employees per year, also known as the OSHA recordable rate, was 1.40 during fiscal 2022.
In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we enforced social distancing and enhanced health, safety and sanitation measures, and implemented necessary procedures and support to enable a significant portion of our office personnel to work remotely. We also imposed travel restrictions, transitioned meetings from in-person to virtual formats where possible, and made other operational adjustments in furtherance of the continued safety of our workforce.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are an equal opportunity employer and strive to create an environment free from discrimination and harassment and in which each employee is valued, treated with dignity and respect, and managed in an inclusive manner. We believe that a workplace that encourages the interaction of different perspectives and backgrounds creates superior solutions, approaches, and innovations. Five years ago, we commissioned the first formal team to better understand and evaluate inclusion and diversity at American Woodmark. Since that time, we have taken deliberate steps to educate our leaders and increase internal awareness within our workforce. Among these actions were the following: establishment of Right Environment Councils in each of our locations in an attempt to more effectively engage and connect with employees of all levels as well as the communities in which we serve; enhancing our employee engagement survey process to include measures specific to inclusion and diversity; creation of an external consultant partnership; establishment of our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Alignment (IDEA) team; launching an enterprise-wide inclusion and diversity strategy, and most recently the inclusion of representation metrics as part of our organizational scorecard and incentive pay components. Going forward, we intend to continue our strategy with the goal of enhancing our culture of inclusion while increasing the diversity of people, thought, and perspectives represented throughout our company.
Our Competitive Strengths
Market Leader with Nationwide Manufacturing and Distribution Network
We believe our company holds the number two or three market position in the United States cabinet market with an estimated 10% market share based on publicly available information. We are one of a select number of market participants with a national manufacturing and distribution footprint, which includes 17 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico and eight primary service centers and one distribution center located throughout the United States. Our operating footprint provides us an 
ability to service our builder, dealer, and home center customers on a national basis, and we offer a broad set of products to serve our customers across a variety of price points. Our facilities are primarily located in or near major metropolitan markets to facilitate efficient product distribution to our customers. We believe the scale and breadth of our operations differentiate us and result in a competitive advantage providing superior customer service, low-cost distribution, and on-time delivery.
Comprehensive Product Offering with Diversified End-Markets
We believe that the diversity of our product portfolio across categories, channels, and end-markets benefits our financial performance, both in periods of growth and cyclicality. Our made-to-order offerings provide products for customers looking for a designer product, which can be used for both new home construction and remodeling applications. Our stock offering allows us to further serve our existing end-markets through the addition of a lower price point product that is well-suited for areas of growing demand such as new home construction targeting the first-time homebuyer. We also offer turnkey cabinet solutions for our builder customers which we believe is a unique aspect of our service platform. Our turnkey solution provides in-house design and measurement as well as installation service. We believe the ability to leverage our labor and expertise is a value-added service to our builder customers which has helped strengthen our position in the new home construction market.
Deep Relationships with Leading Retailers
We have built strong and stable relationships with a base of long-standing customers across home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors. We have an average relationship length of 20 plus years with our top 10 customers, including long-standing relationships with Home Depot and Lowe's. We believe our customers value our national manufacturing and distribution footprint, which allows us to meet demanding logistics and performance criteria. We believe our focus on providing exceptional customer service and a quality product at a competitive price have enabled us to establish ourselves as a vendor of choice.
Best-in-Class Manufacturing Capabilities
We operate 17 manufacturing facilities across the United States and Mexico. Our vertically-integrated production and assembly lines, standardized product construction, and investments in automation, have allowed us to continuously improve productivity and efficiency. We have standardized our raw material inputs and a number of our production processes, which reduces logistical requirements and provides increased economies of scale in sourcing these inputs. Our labor-intensive manufacturing and fabrication processes in Mexico offer a low cost alternative to Asian based manufacturers, while providing a quality product with lower transportation costs. 
Experienced Management Team
We have assembled an executive team from leading organizations with a deep base of management experience within industrial manufacturing companies. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, M. Scott Culbreth, joined our team in 2014 as the Chief Financial Officer and was named Chief Executive Officer in 2020. Mr. Culbreth's career in the manufacturing industry has been highlighted with multiple leadership roles in finance. Our other senior executives all have over twenty plus years of experience working for multi-national companies, with individual backgrounds in manufacturing, finance, and marketing.
