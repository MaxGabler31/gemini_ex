Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 We are a leading and rapidly growing synthetic biology company that has developed a disruptive DNA synthesis platform to industrialize the engineering of biology. The core of our platform is a proprietary technology that pioneers a new method of manufacturing synthetic DNA by writing DNA on a silicon chip. We have combined this technology with proprietary software, scalable commercial infrastructure and an e-commerce platform to create an integrated technology platform that enables us to achieve high levels of quality, precision, automation, and manufacturing throughput at a significantly lower cost than our competitors. We are leveraging our unique technology to manufacture a broad range of synthetic DNA-based products, including synthetic genes, tools for next generation sample preparation, and antibody libraries for drug discovery and development. Additionally, we believe our platform will enable new value-add opportunities, such as discovery partnerships for biologic drugs, and will enable new applications for synthetic DNA, such as digital data storage, which will drive growth in the market for our products. 
 We sell our synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products to over 700 customers across a broad range of industries. 
 DNA is the fundamental building block of biology. The ability to design DNA and engineer biology, a field known as synthetic biology. The ability to modify DNA to serve different purposes is leading to a broad range of applications for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products across multiple industries, including:

 We were founded in 2013 and are incorporated in the state of Delaware. 
 Background 
 The synthetic biology market is increasing due to increased access to affordable and innovative tools that enable new applications. We believe this is analogous to the trends seen in the next generation sequencing, or NGS, market, where declining costs of sequencing drove adoption, new applications and market expansion. Similarly, tools that combine advanced production technology with modern digital technology and software capabilities, such as our DNA synthesis platform, are driving growth and market creation for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products. In calendar year 2017, the market for synthetic biology products was approximately $4.4 billion and is expected to grow to $13.9 billion by calendar year 2022. 
 In fiscal 2018, we served 719 customers including $8.7 million in sales to Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc., or Ginkgo Bioworks (which we believe is the largest global purchaser of synthetic DNA). We are also an original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, of synthetic DNA to four synthetic DNA manufacturers that also compete with us. In February 2018, we launched an innovative and comprehensive sample preparation kit for next generation sequencing at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology conference. Our kit leverages our platform to precisely synthesize oligo pools and uniformly amplify the desired target DNA segments, considerably improving the accuracy of the downstream sequencing analysis. We have also commercialized a custom DNA library solution which enables more effective biologic drug discovery and development for our customers. We believe we can further leverage our platform to develop other proprietary tools, such as our G-protein coupled receptor, or GPCR, library and antibody optimization solution, to provide an end-to-end solution in biologics drug discovery and early development, from target to investigational new drug, or IND, application, adding value as a partner to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We also aim to explore development of DNA as a digital data storage medium via internal research and industry partnerships. 
 Our currently marketed products target the synthetic DNA market, a sub-segment of the synthetic biology market, and NGS sample preparation, a large adjacent market opportunity. We estimate that the combined market opportunity was $1.8 billion in calendar year 2016. We believe that current estimates understate our market potential because they reflect the costly, time-consuming, and cumbersome nature of legacy DNA synthesis technologies. We believe our solution has the potential to materially expand our initial market by providing end users access to high-quality and lower cost tools, encouraging adoption and facilitating new applications for our products 
 Our currently marketed product offering addresses a market opportunity that was approximately $1.8 billion in calendar year 2016. We believe our solution has the potential to materially expand our initial market by providing end-users with access to high-quality and lower cost tools, encouraging adoption and facilitating new applications for our products, such as pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery and digital data storage in DNA. 
 Synthetic DNA market 
 We believe that our current market opportunity for synthetic DNA was approximately $1.3 billion in calendar year 2016. The market consists of those who buy DNA, or DNA Buyers, and those who make their own DNA, or DNA Makers. Driven by access to more affordable and high-quality synthetic DNA, we believe that there is a strong trend of DNA Makers converting to DNA Buyers. According to BCC Research, the size of the DNA Buyer market in 2016 was approximately $300 million and is growing at a rate of approximately 20% annually as existing DNA Buyers develop new uses for synthetic DNA and existing DNA Makers convert to DNA Buyers. We estimate our market opportunity in the DNA Maker market to be approximately $950 million. Our market estimate is based on the market sizes for products used in manual DNA synthesis, including the cloning and restriction digestion enzyme market in 2016, according to a report on Molecular Biology by Markets and Markets.

 NGS sample preparation market 
 Our NGS sample preparation kits address the demand for better sample preparation products that improve the sequencing workflow, increase sequencing accuracy and lower sequencing costs. We offer kits consisting of double-stranded DNA probes and a comprehensive target enrichment kit that are used for exome sequencing and custom targeted sequencing. Kalorama Information, a division of marketresearch.com, estimates the market for sample preparation for next generation sequencing was approximately $500 million in calendar year 2016 and growing at approximately 20% annually. 
 Pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery 
 We believe we are uniquely positioned to capture a larger portion of the drug discovery value chain given that our synthetic DNA products are already used by our pharmaceutical partners throughout the drug development process. As part of our effort in this market, we recently launched our custom DNA library solution which facilitates biologic drug discovery and development. We are already in agreement with a top three pharmaceutical company by revenue to supply our custom DNA libraries instead of them producing their own. In addition to our custom DNA libraries, we are also developing other proprietary tools, such as a wholly-owned GPCR library and an antibody optimization solution, that we believe will enable us to provide an end-to-end solution in biologics drug discovery and early development, from target to investigational new drug, or IND, application, and adding value as a partner to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These partnerships may include upfront, milestone and royalty payments. 
 Digital data storage in DNA 
 Due to the explosion of data across many industries, finding efficient means of storage has become more important. Through the Semiconductor Research Corporation, many leading semiconductor companies, including Microsoft Corporation, IBM Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Autodesk Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and GlobalFoundries Inc., are exploring DNA as a data storage medium. We have strategic relationships with Microsoft Corporation and the University of Washington through which we have demonstrated the feasibility of storing data on DNA and the unique benefits of longevity, density, and universality of this format. We believe that in three to five years, new DNA technologies and cost efficiencies could surpass mature information technology hardware solutions to allow data storage in DNA to become cost competitive with traditional storage media and enable us to target several large markets within data storage. The market for digital data storage is more than $35 billion and we believe DNA can address several segments within this market. 
 We believe the growth of the synthetic DNA market is analogous to the trends seen in the next generation sequencing (NGS) market, where rapid innovation is resulting in the declining costs of sequencing, increased adoption, development of new applications and market expansion. Similarly, tools that combine advanced production technology with modern digital technology and software capabilities, such as our DNA synthesis platform, are driving growth and market creation for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products. Therefore, we believe that market estimates understate the potential for our products as they reflect a market that has historically been limited by the costly, time-consuming, and cumbersome nature of legacy DNA synthesis methods. We are experiencing rapid growth for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products as we improve access to affordable tools that encourage adoption of, and foster new applications and markets for, our products. 
 Our products 
 We have developed multiple products derived from synthetic DNA and our versatile DNA synthesis technology. Our current offering consists of four primary products that address different needs of our customers across a variety of applications: synthetic genes, oligo pools, next generation sequencing tools and DNA libraries. 
 
4 


 Synthetic genes 
 Synthetic genes are manufactured strands of DNA. Customers order our synthetic genes to conduct a wide range of research, including product development for the healthcare, agricultural, and industrial chemical industries as well as a multitude of applications within academic research. Virtually all research and development requires trial and error, and our customers require many variations of genes to find the DNA sequence that achieves their objectives. 
 We offer two primary categories of synthetic genes: genes of perfect quality, clonal genes, in a vehicle to carry the DNA, also called a vector, and genes of near-perfect quality, non-clonal genes or fragments, that customers can place in their own vector. Within these two categories, customers can order different lengths of DNA depending on their required final gene construct. Customers can order longer genes or shorter genes and can stitch genes together to create longer or shorter constructs if desired. 
 Clonal genes in a Twist Bioscience or customer vector 
 Our premier gene synthesis offering delivers clonally perfect genes. For our clonally perfect genes, we perform the cloning on behalf of our customers and deliver DNA in either a customer-supplied vector or a Twist Bioscience vector. Customer-supplied vectors greatly simplify downstream work for our customers, allowing them to take our genes and pass them directly into their workflows. We have also developed a catalog of our own specific vectors. Currently, we manufacture genes of up to 3,200 base pairs in length, yielding a clonally perfect piece of DNA that our customers can immediately use for their research. We offer turnaround times of approximately 15  20 business days for clonal genes. Our standard pricing for clonal DNA is $0.09 per base pair for genes between 300 and 1,800 bps in length. 
 Non-clonal genes 
 Non-clonal genes serve customers who prefer to conduct their own cloning protocols or that do not need, or want, to pay for perfect quality genes. We offer non-clonal genes of up to 1,800 base pairs in length, which we believe addresses the vast majority of demand for non-clonal genes. From October 2017 through September 2018, we offered average monthly turnaround times of approximately five to eleven business days for non-clonal genes. Our standard pricing for non-clonal genes is $0.07 per base pair. 
 Oligonucleotide (Oligo) pools 
 Oligo pools, or high diversity collections of oligonucleotides, are utilized in many applications, including targeted next generation sequencing, or NGS, CRISPR gene editing, mutagenesis experiments, DNA origami (the nanoscale folding of DNA to create two- and three-dimensional shapes at the nanoscale), DNA computing and data storage in DNA, among others. Our oligo pools are also used for high-throughput reporter assays that are used to study cell signaling pathways, gene regulation, and the structure of cell regulatory elements. For these applications, we provide customers with accurate and uniform synthetic oligos to precisely match their required designs. 
 We sell a diverse, customizable set of oligo pools, ranging from a few hundred oligos to over one million and offer oligonucleotides of up to 200 nucleotides in length and, from October 2017 through September 2018, average monthly turnaround times of four to six business days. As of the date of this Form 10-K, our standard pricing for oligo pools is between $0.10 to $1.00 per oligo depending primarily on order size. Because the ability to design oligo pools and customize their experiments is very important to our customers, we have established a co-marketing agreement with a company that specializes in developing algorithms which enable customers to design optimized and high-quality oligo pools. Integration of this design capability with our oligo pool synthesis production competency enables our customers to design and receive a high-quality oligo pool customized to meet their needs. 
 In the future, we expect to offer longer oligonucleotides, cloned pools, and a sub-pooling capability which will allow our customers to purchase lower complexity pools and arrayed pools.

 Oligo pools for CRISPR gene editing 
 CRISPR is a recently discovered gene editing tool that has become an area of significant research focus, especially in drug development, and is a rapidly growing application that is contributing to growing demand for our oligo pools. In the CRISPR editing process, a short sequence of RNA called guide-RNA (gRNA) binds to its target DNA sequence in a host cell, indicating to an enzyme where to cut and edit the DNA. In order to conduct gene editing research, many single guide-RNA must be created. Researchers can use oligo pools for CRISPR gene editing to silence, through editing, DNA locations. This process creates an error at a particular location in the DNA of the cell, rendering that location unusable, in other words silenced. By studying the relationship between silenced regions and change in phenotype (did the disease get worse or better), researchers can find the genomic regions important to the disease and identify targets for therapeutics. Similar to our standard oligo pools, we offer oligo pools for CRISPR screening with a diverse and customizable set of specifications, including pool sizes ranging from a few hundred oligos to over one million. From oligo produced on a single silicon chip, researchers can edit up to 1,000,000 DNA locations. We currently offer oligo pools for CRISPR screening of up to 200 nucleotides in length, which we believe addresses the vast majority of the market for CRISPR guide library generation. 
 Next generation sequencing (NGS) tools 
 We recently expanded the application of our DNA synthesis technology to develop products targeted at the large next generation sequencing market, or NGS. In particular, we are focused on addressing the demand for better sample preparation products that improve sequencing workflow, increase sequencing accuracy, and lower sequencing costs. In the target enrichment process, the DNA probes enrich a DNA sample by binding to specified segments of DNA in order to isolate and physically extract the targeted segment of DNA from the sample, prior to downstream sequencing. The targeted segment of DNA can then be copied uniformly prior to NGS analysis by our customers, yielding a larger volume of targeted segments in the sample used for sequencing. Because we are able to precisely target, extract, and uniformly amplify the target DNA segments, our solution considerably improves the accuracy of the downstream sequencing analysis. This enables our customers to perform fewer sequencing runs per sample, without sacrificing accuracy, saving them time and money. 
 We believe we are the only company to offer double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probes within a comprehensive target enrichment kit used for exome and targeted sequencing. Using dsDNA as opposed to single-stranded DNA, or RNA, during next generation sequencing preparation avoids the problem of deamination (removal of an amino group). Deamination interferes with the detection of infrequent gene mutations, and may hinder genetic results and clinical diagnosis, particularly in cancer. 
 Our NGS products are primarily used for diagnostic testing, research for population genetics and biomarker discovery, translational research, microbiology and applied markets. Our customers are primarily diagnostic companies and hospitals, research institutions, agricultural biotechnology companies, and consumer genetics companies conducting diagnostic tests for a wide range of applications. 
 In addition to our DNA probes, we have created a comprehensive sample preparation kit that combines these probes for NGS target enrichment with all the reagents and consumables necessary to process a sample into sequencing-ready material. This improves the NGS library preparation workflow and is a cost-effective solution that reduces sequencing costs, improves time to results, enhances sequencing coverage, and provides quality control on every DNA probe. 
 We have launched a kit for sequencing of the exome, or NGS exome capture, the entire known coding region of the genome. We currently deliver this exome kit within two to three weeks for our customers. Our NGS tools pricing is based on the numbers of reactions and pools requested by a customer.

 DNA libraries 
 DNA libraries are collections of DNA fragments that are primarily used by pharmaceutical companies during antibody discovery and development. During the drug discovery phase, a pharmaceutical company typically has a biological target or function of interest. In order to find antibodies that best bind to that target in a specific region of a gene and deliver a therapeutic effect, it may be necessary to test many variants of an antibody. Synthetic DNA libraries become useful in this process, as they produce customized, controllable groups of antibodies from specific DNA sequences to run through assays that assess function, toxicity and binding affinity. 
 Traditionally, pharmaceutical companies have generated antibody libraries through a process called random mutagenesis. This uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis, where PCR is used to introduce many sequence errors, or variations, within the copies of the antibody. While this generates many different antibody variants, the changes are entirely random and are unknown until the antibody DNA is sequenced. In addition, because of the random approach, there is no guarantee that the resulting antibodies will target the desired region of interest. 
 Our platform allows customers to customize every antibody variation and construct a precise library systematically to target the entire region of interest. We can create single site libraries in which we change one single amino acid (a group of three DNA bases) within the sequence or single site saturation libraries in which we change every amino acid within the sequence for a more comprehensive approach. We can also generate combinatorial libraries in which we introduce changes to multiple sites within the same gene in specific ratios and combinations. These libraries can be used for antibody engineering, affinity maturation, and humanization, which simplifies downstream screening and identifies more lead molecules. Our libraries are explicitly developed for a specific area of the genome or tailored to a specific disease, with antibody compounds evenly represented across all areas of the genome desired. 
 To support our efforts to add further value for our customers and potential partners, we are in the process of creating a comprehensive antibody optimization solution to enable simultaneous optimization of multiple characteristics of a given antibody. Working with Distributed Bio, we developed custom software for the optimization of antibody hits, antibody compounds that meet pre-specified criteria for therapeutic development. We are now working to add our high throughput and hyper-variant antibody library capabilities to create a comprehensive antibody optimization solution for potential partners. We plan to use this solution to design, build and test hyper-variant, tightly controlled antibody libraries that follow the rules of the human repertoire and mitigate the pitfalls associated with traditional optimization methods. By following the rules of the human repertoire, which means including only DNA sequences known to occur in humans, these libraries will be natural in composition and are expected to generate better drug development candidates. The libraries also have a large degree of synthetic variation, enabling simultaneous optimization of several antibody characteristics and the discovery of antibodies with high affinity and specificity to drug targets. 
 Additionally, we plan to leverage our ability to rapidly generate custom libraries to discover novel therapeutic antibodies against biological targets that have traditionally been difficult for biological drug development. Specifically, through a collaboration with Distributed Bio we have developed a proprietary antibody library targeting a major class of proteins known as GPCRs. GPCRs are important receptors that control and drive the biology of nearly all disease classes, including inflammation, cancer, metabolism, respiratory, and pain. According to a recent publication in Molecular Pharmacology, approximately 700 approved therapeutics target GPCRs, representing approximately 35% of all approved drugs. However, they remain a difficult class of targets for antibody development due to the lack of exposed protein surfaces to bind. We are now validating this GPCR library of highly designed antibodies and screening it against three GPCR targets and we may partner with other technology providers to advance development of our anti-GPCR antibody discovery efforts. If we are successful in validating the utility of our DNA library synthesis capabilities to address this traditionally difficult class of antibody targets, we may also develop libraries for screening and selection of other biological therapeutic targets such as ion channels and membrane based transporters. 
 We believe we have several avenues available to monetize our antibody discovery program. For example, we anticipate that successful discovery of a novel therapeutic antibody against any single GPCR target would attract significant partnership interest from academic institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies given the difficult nature of this class of antibody targets. These partnerships may include upfront, milestone and royalty payments to us for access to our GPCR library.

 Our target markets 
 Our currently marketed product offering addresses a market opportunity that was approximately $1.8 billion in calendar year 2016. We believe that current market estimates underestimate the potential for synthetic DNA because they reflect the costly, time-consuming and cumbersome nature of legacy DNA synthesis technologies. We believe our solution has the potential to materially expand our initial market by providing end users access to high-quality and lower cost tools, encouraging adoption and facilitating new applications for our products. 
 DNA synthesisDNA Buyers and DNA Makers 
 Our core DNA synthesis market includes our synthetic DNA, oligo pools and DNA libraries. We believe that our current market opportunity for synthetic DNA was approximately $1.3 billion in calendar year 2016. The market consists of those who buy DNA, or DNA Buyers, and those who make their own DNA, or DNA Makers. Driven by access to more affordable and high-quality synthetic DNA, we believe that there is a strong trend of DNA Makers converting to DNA Buyers. 
 DNA Buyers 
 DNA Buyers are generally commercial users in the healthcare, industrial, agricultural and academic fields who require large amounts of DNA. These customers value speed, throughput, and reliability and are increasingly price sensitive given the volume of DNA that they purchase. According to BCC Research, the size of the buyer market in 2016 was approximately $300 million and is growing at a rate of approximately 20% annually as existing DNA Buyers develop new uses for synthetic DNA and existing DNA Makers convert to DNA Buyers. 
 DNA Makers 
 DNA Makers purchase supplies in order to make their own DNA. They typically require only a few genes at a time and are very price sensitive. While the consumables required to make DNA are relatively inexpensive, it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. The steps include copying and pasting each DNA sequence from one vector to another using restriction enzymes, and mutagenizing the sequence of interest to obtain the desired variant and cloning DNA. Our customers in this market segment are predominantly small-scale synthetic DNA users, which typically include emerging biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and research organizations. We estimate our market opportunity in the DNA Maker market to be approximately $950 million with estimated annual growth of approximately 10%. Our market estimate is based on the market sizes for products used in manual DNA synthesis, including the cloning and restriction digestion enzyme market in 2016, according to a report on Molecular Biology by Markets and Markets. 
 Cloning one gene is a cumbersome process which typically involves 11 discrete steps and generally takes around 4 - 10 business days to complete. However, most small scale researchers have historically made their own DNA due to the prohibitively high cost of purchasing synthetic DNA in small batches. Given the inefficiency of making DNA, we are increasingly seeing DNA Makers transition to DNA Buyers as we provide broader access to affordable DNA. In addition, as we increase the size of the DNA that we offer, we expect to convert certain researchers who are both DNA Buyers and DNA Makers that buy multiple genes and stitch them together for longer constructs. We also expect the implementation of our intuitive e-commerce platform to provide enhanced access to the relatively untapped market of DNA Makers. 
 We believe that the DNA synthesis market is in the early stages of a growth acceleration that is similar to the growth experienced by the DNA sequencing industry over the last two decades, where initial demand was severely limited by the high cost and time required to sequence genes. The Human Genome Project, which resulted in the sequencing of the full human genome in 2003, cost $2.7 billion in government

  funding. At that time, the cost to sequence an entire genome was $50 million. An enormous reduction in cost was required before human genome sequencing could realistically be used as a medical research tool. With innovation in sequencing technology, the first $1,000 genome was achieved in 2014, and costs are significantly lower today. 
 As the cost of sequencing has decreased, both the size of the market and the number of applications has expanded exponentially. Over the last five years, the market size has more than doubled. DeciBio LLC estimates that by 2016 the total market for sequencing technology had grown to approximately $2.4 billion and expects the market to continue to grow at 17% annually to approximately $4.5 billion by 2019. We believe the synthetic DNA market is undergoing a comparable transformation. 
 Products for next generation sequencing applications (exome and custom capture tools) 
 Our NGS products target a market opportunity for NGS sample preparation that was approximately $500 million in calendar year 2016 and growing at approximately 20% annually, according to market research provided by Kalorama Information, a division of marketresearch.com. As the cost of sequencing genes has decreased significantly, the applications of sequencing and the utilization of sequencing technology has increased rapidly. Today, sequencing is used in many fields, including the study of population genetics to discover disease specific markers and the diagnosis of patient-specific mutations. However, in many cases, the sequencing of an entire genome is undesirable and custom targeted sequencing, which focuses on specific regions of the genome, is preferable, as it results in a lower cost per sample and deeper coverage. For example, cancer samples are notoriously heterogeneous, and sequencing them multiple times to achieve the desired result, otherwise known as deep sequencing, would be too costly using whole genome sequencing. Similarly, a growing clinical application for cancer treatment called minimal residual disease analysis requires following the evolution of a few genetic locations to instruct physicians when they have successfully managed the disease and can stop therapy. In this application, and many others, it is significantly more cost-effective to use exome sequencing and custom targeted sequencing rather than whole genome sequencing. 
 We are focused on addressing the demand for better sample preparation products that improve the sequencing workflow, increase sequencing accuracy and lower sequencing costs. We offer kits consisting of double-stranded DNA probes and a comprehensive set of reagents that are used for exome sequencing and custom targeted sequencing. 
 Pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery 
 In the field of pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery, we believe our platform can significantly accelerate the time it takes researchers to go from target identification to an IND application. We believe the integral role of synthetic DNA in the drug discovery and development process along with our DNA synthesis platform uniquely positions us to capture a larger portion of this value chain. 
 In the initial stages of drug development, our oligo pools can be used to increase the probability of identifying a specific drug target. Our genes and gene fragments can be used to validate the specific function of this drug target. Our DNA libraries can be used in the drug discovery process to identify high value biological therapeutic drug leads. As a biological lead moves towards clinical development, our genes, gene fragments, and antibody libraries can again aid in the lead optimization process. In the clinic, our NGS target enrichment offering may also play a role in patient selection and stratification. 
 Through our partnership with Distributed Bio, we are beginning to generate proprietary content in biologics with an initial focus on G-protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs. We also are seeking to establish partnerships to develop content related to additional target areas with other pharmaceutical companies. 
 Current antibody discovery and development methods rely on the creation of very large number of antibody variations (approximately >1010 ) in a format that can be screened, or tested, rapidly. These libraries consist of DNA sequences expressed into proteins (antibodies) and screened for desired functions which usually requires multiple iterations of designing, constructing and testing antibodies.

 Today, many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers use random mutagenesis to generate diversity in their antibody libraries. Random mutagenesis has the following disadvantages: 
 

 | The random mutations created through this process may not be found in the human body and therefore may be unlikely to behave well in a clinical setting, may be immunogenic, may aggregate or not express well
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Libraries created from random mutagenesis lack synthetic control in their fabrication and therefore are incapable of enabling researchers to systematically explore changing to individual DNA bases across the DNA sequence and the impact on the antibody
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In contrast to the traditional library synthesis methods described above, we are leveraging our DNA synthesis platform to precisely control the design and synthesis of the library, changing each base individually, rather than each codon (group of three bases), creating controlled, predictable library diversity. We believe this will allow researchers to explore the desired sequence variations and combinations desired to facilitate their discovery efforts more effectively. 
 DNA data storage R&D 
 Due to the explosion of data across many industries, finding efficient means of storage has become more important. Through the Semiconductor Research Corporation, many leading semiconductor companies, including Microsoft Corporation, IBM Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Autodesk Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and GlobalFoundries Inc., are exploring DNA as a data storage medium. The market for digital data storage, including solid-state disk, magnetic disk, magnetic tape and optical disc storage, is currently estimated at over $35 billion. 
 While DNA is currently too expensive for routine storage, we believe that our modern, silicon-based process to synthesize DNA has the potential to make DNA cost-competitive with additional research and development efforts. If the cost of writing and reading data in DNA becomes equivalent to or lower than magnetic tape, we believe DNA will have the advantage in serving several data storage markets, including the storage of deeply cold data, in particular the WORN (Write Once, Read Never) and WORSE (Write Once, Read Seldom if Ever) markets, and the market for digital preservation where latency and the cost of reading the data are minor considerations. Typical end-markets for these storage applications include the media and entertainment industries, healthcare/pharmaceutical record storage, cultural/heritage organizations, scientific data records storage, intelligence/defense information, and libraries/museum collections. 
 Through our relationship with Microsoft Corporation and the University of Washington, we have demonstrated the feasibility of storing data on DNA and the unique benefits of longevity, density, and universality of this format. We believe that over time our technology will develop to allow data storage in DNA to become cost competitive with traditional data storage media, which is necessary to enable us to target several large markets within data storage. 
 In order to reduce the cost of synthesizing DNA, we are focused on innovating our proprietary platform to synthesize DNA at an even higher throughput, moving from a platform capable of storing megabytes of data to a platform capable of storing terabytes of data. Taking into account trends and internal projections for the cost of synthesizing oligo pools, sequencing price, hard drive price and tape price, we believe new DNA technologies and cost efficiencies could surpass mature information technology hardware solutions in three to five years. We are employing advanced techniques from the semiconductor industry to further miniaturize the chemistry and fluid movement to pursue this opportunity. 
 Complementing the reduction in cost for making DNA, we are also developing a system to manage the data flow; that is, from binary data to DNA and back to binary data. The equivalent of a computer operating system, it will be responsible for accessing a digital data file of 0s and 1s, applying an encoding scheme to convert the digital data into DNA sequences for synthesis and storage, and, after the stored DNA is sequenced, applying a decoding scheme to retrieve the original digital data file.

 Since our formation in 2013, we have grown rapidly and achieved several key milestones that we believe position us for continued growth and success: 
 

 | In 2015, we demonstrated the benefits and validated the commercial utility of our proprietary silicon-based platform for DNA synthesis through a proof-of-concept program called the Alpha Access program, which provided initial access to our platform to select customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In 2016, we (i) secured a long-term contract with Ginkgo Bioworks to provide up to 100 million base pairs of DNA, which we believe was the largest agreement for synthetic DNA at that time, (ii) launched our early commercial access program in April called the Beta Access program to select customers and expanded our existing relationship with Ginkgo Bioworks, (iii) acquired Genome Compiler Corporation to add software design capabilities for our e-commerce ordering system, (iv) laid the groundwork to pursue an opportunity in biologics drug discovery though a relationship with Distributed Bio, Inc., and (v) supplied DNA to Microsoft Corporation for its work with the University of Washington to develop DNA as a data storage medium.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In 2017, we continued to increase penetration with existing customers and expand our customer base, by (i) serving 286 customers (up from 97 customers in 2016), (ii) extending the scope of our relationship with Microsoft Corporation and the University of Washington, (iii) entering into an agreement to supply thousands of genes for public benefit through the BioBricks Foundation, (iv) successfully achieving industry-leading volumes of synthetic DNA shipped every month, (v) becoming an OEM supplier of synthetic DNA to four synthetic DNA manufacturers that also compete with us, (vi) launching our e-commerce platform to existing customers in October 2017 and (vii) shipping over 38,000 genes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to approximately 7,600 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which represents 400% year-over-year growth.

 Sales and marketing 
 We have built a scalable commercial platform that enables us to reach a diverse customer base that we estimate consists of over 100,000 synthetic DNA users, and many additional potential customers of our NGS library preparation products today. In order to address this diverse customer base, we have employed a multi-channel strategy comprised of a direct sales force targeting synthetic DNA customers, a direct sales force focusing on the NGS market and an e-commerce platform. Our sales force is focused on customer acquisition, support, and management across industries, and is highly trained on both the technical aspects of our platform and how synthetic DNA can be used in a wide range of industries. We launched our proprietary, innovative, and easy-to-use e-commerce platform in October 2017 to existing customers and expanded access to the general public in January 2018. Our platform allows customers to design, validate, and place on-demand orders of customized DNA online, and enable them to receive real-time customized quotes for their products and track their order status through the manufacturing and delivery process. This is a critical part of our strategy to address our large market and diverse customer base, as well as drive commercial productivity, enhance the customer experience, and promote loyalty. We target customers of our NGS products through a direct sales team focused on the NGS tools market and which is separate from our synthetic DNA sales force. Our direct NGS sales representatives are focused on supporting our early adopters and providing a high level of service in order to familiarize customers with our product offering.

 We sell our products through a worldwide selling organization that includes direct sales personnel, commercial consultants in Europe, Asia and China, an ecommerce platform and distributors. As of September 30, 2018, we employed 68 people in sales, marketing and customer support. We have three distributors in the Americas and 12 distributors in the rest of the world. Sales to distributors accounted for less than 5% of revenues in fiscal 2018. 
 In fiscal 2018, United States sales represented 69%, and international sales represented 31% of our revenues. Of our international sales in fiscal 2018, 84% were derived from sales in Europe and the Middle East, approximately 6% were derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region, 3% were derived from sales in Canada and Mexico, and 7% were derived from sales in China. For financial information about geographic areas for each of our last three fiscal years, see Note 16, Geographic and product information, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. For a discussion of the risks attendant to our foreign operations, see Item 1A, Risk Factors-Our international operations expose us to material risks, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item. 
 Research and development 
 Our research and development expenses were $20.3 million in fiscal 2018, $19.2 million in fiscal 2017 and $18.2 million in fiscal 2016. As of September 30, 2018, we employed 75 people in engineering and research and development activities. 
 We are engaged in ongoing research and development efforts focused on enhancements to existing products and the development of new products. Currently, we are pursuing research and development projects with respect to the following: 
 

 | Process development for higher quality and longer oligos
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | Optimization, automation and miniaturization of gene and NGS pipelines
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Silicon process and chemistry development for our data storage division
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Building a massively parallel screening facility for our pharma division
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion of our product offering for oligo, gene and NGS products
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Research and development activities are conducted in collaboration with manufacturing activities to help expedite new products from the development phase to manufacturing and to more quickly implement new process technologies. From time to time, our research and development efforts have included participation in technology collaborations with universities and research institutions. 
 Patents and other intellectual property rights 
 As of September 30, 2018, we own 10 issued U.S. patents and 2 issued international patents in China. There are 72 pending patent applications, including 28 in the United States, 32 international applications and 12 applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We rely on a combination of patent rights, copyrights and trade secrets to protect the proprietary elements of our products. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. 
 Manufacturing and facilities 
 The production of our products is a highly complex and precise process. Twist has approximately 15,000 square feet of manufacturing space located at our headquarters in San Francisco and in South San Francisco, California. We currently manufacture all of our products and multiple sub-assemblies at these facilities. As of September 30, 2018, we had 64 full-time employees dedicated to manufacturing our synthetic genes, oligo pools, NGS tools, and DNA libraries.

 All of our products originate from synthetic DNA obtained from nanostructured clusters fabricated on our proprietary silicon technology platform. Due to its on-demand nature, the gene synthesis business requires manufacturing operations to be in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days per year. For synthetic genes, we have built a highly scalable gene production process with what we believe is industry-leading capacity of more than 45,000 genes per month to address the growing demand of scalable, high-quality, affordable synthetic genes. In the month of September 2018, we only utilized approximately a third of this production capacity for synthetic genes and oligos. 
 In addition to synthetic genes, we are combining nanostructured clusters into oligo pools. If our production was dedicated entirely to the oligos, we currently have the capacity to produce more than 20 million high-quality oligos per month that can be combined into high-precision oligo pools of various sizes. The pooling process has been fully automated through a mixture of custom proprietary and over-the-counter liquid handling equipment. We are currently only utilizing approximately a third of this production capacity for synthetic genes and oligos. We intend to increase our shipments to leverage our production capacity through our e-commerce platform, which we believe will expand both our market opportunity and our customer base. 
 The manufacturing process for our NGS tools is highly flexible and scalable and requires minimal fixed costs and direct labor given the efficiency of our production capability. We have automated the entire workflow using proprietary and over-the-counter laboratory equipment. We have built dedicated production capabilities for our NGS products, which began operation in October 2017. We plan to have the full NGS workflow International Organization for Standardization 13485 certified in 2018 to comply with diagnostic industry regulatory requirements. 
 Over time, to further improve our production process, we intend to outsource various sub-assemblies to third-party manufacturers. 
 We initially certified our Quality Management System (QMS) to the ISO 9001:2000 standard and in 2010 updated our certification to ISO 9001:2008. ISO is an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems. Subsequent audits by the registrar have been and will continue to be carried out at regular intervals to ensure we are maintaining our system in compliance with ISO standards. Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification. Also, we have our QMS certified to the ISO 13485:2012 Quality Management Standard and the Canadian Medical Devices Regulation (CMDR). These standards include a special set of requirements specifically related to the supply of medical devices and related services. Additionally, we manufacture to current FDA Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and our QMS is implemented in accordance with FDA Quality System Regulations (21 CFR 820). 
 Supply chain 
 We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we compete with both large and emerging providers in the life sciences tools and diagnostics industries focused on sample preparation for next generation sequencing such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Illumina, Inc., Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Agilent, and Roche NimbleGen, Inc. In the antibody discovery market, we compete with clinical research organizations, such as LakePharma (mouse hybridoma, llama immune libraries, XOMA phage display library) and Aldevron, LLC (genetic mouse immunization coupled with hybridoma), and antibody discovery biotechnology companies, such as Iontas (human phage display libraries, human phage display library focused on ion channels), Adimab (human synthetic yeast display libraries), and Distributed Bio (human synthetic phage display library, lead optimization libraries). In the field of DNA digital data storage, we compete with Catalog Technologies, Inc., ETH Zurich, Helixworks, Iridia, Inc., North Shore Bio and Roswell 
 Employees 
 At September 30, 2018, we employed 289 employees, of whom 75 were primarily engaged in engineering and research and development activities, 68 in marketing, sales and customer support, 109 in operations and manufacturing and 37 in general and administration. Of these employees, 180 hold engineering or science degrees, including 50 Ph.D.s. 
Seasonality 
 Over the years, we have experienced a pattern, although not consistently, in our fourth quarter of reduced revenues or reduced growth in revenues from quarter to sequential quarter because of summer vacations and year-end holiday schedules in our customers facilities, particularly in our European operations.

 Government regulation 
 The synthetic biology industry and our current product portfolio is largely unregulated by governmental bodies such as the FDA. Our products are also not intended to be components or incorporated into our customers products. Rather, our synthetic DNA products enable our customers to develop a wide spectrum of commercial products, some of which may require governmental approval. If a customers product requires governmental approval, as would be the case with the development of medical diagnostics and therapeutic drugs, it is the customer who seeks and obtains the required governmental approval to commercialize those products. However, in the future we may be subject to a variety of specialized regulatory requirements, including potential regulation by the FDA, any of which could have a material effect on the business. 
 Research Use Only is a term limited to our target enrichment products for the next-generation sequencing market, and is specifically applied only to kits sold to this market segment, and is intended to restrict use of the kits to non-in vitro diagnostic purposes. The RUO label is not affixed to any other products. Our NGS target enrichment and library preparation products are used in a more comprehensive workflow for next generation sequencing. It is this larger workflow that can become an in vitro diagnostic, after undergoing the appropriate regulatory processes. As noted above, our NGS products target a market opportunity for NGS sample preparation that was approximately $500 million in calendar year 2016 and growing at approximately 20% annually, according to market research provided by Kalorama Information, a division of marketresearch.com. This market estimate represents the NGS target enrichment products which are limited solely to the RUO component of target enrichment and library preparation and does not include the full in vitro diagnostic workflow. 
 While most of the current laws and regulations concerning synthetic biology relate to the end products produced using synthetic biology, this may change. For example, in December 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the federal government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the federal government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms. 
 While we and our subsidiaries maintain regulatory compliance practices, we rely on our customers compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the products they produce. We do not independently monitor whether our customers comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
 FDA
 Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices. 
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared devices are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a Premarket Approval Application, or PMA. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II. Class II classification usually requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDC Act, referred to as 510(k) clearance. Most Class I devices are exempt from this requirement, as are some lower risk Class II devices. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process. 
 
15 


 In vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, are a category of medical devices that include reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. IVDs are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body. A research use only, or RUO, IVD product is an IVD product that is in the laboratory research phase of development. As such, an RUO IVD is not intended for use in clinical investigations or in clinical practice. Such RUO products do not require premarket clearance or approval from the FDA, provided that they be labeled For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures pursuant to FDA regulations. 
 As presently contemplated, none of our IVD products are intended for clinical or diagnostic use, and we market them to academic institutions, life sciences and clinical research laboratories that conduct research, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Our current IVD products are marketed and labeled as RUO, and are provided to our customers solely for their internal research use. Accordingly, we believe that our current IVD products are subject only to limited regulation with respect to labeling by the FDA, and we have not sought clearance or approval from the FDA to market our products. 
 In November 2013, the FDA issued final guidance indicating that merely including the RUO labeling statement will not necessarily render the device exempt from FDA premarket clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intended its IVDs for diagnostic use. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the products advertising, labeling, or promotion, or the manufacturers assistance of a clinical laboratory in validating or verifying a test that incorporates products labeled RUO. We do not believe any of these circumstances apply to our current product portfolio. 
 While we believe that none of our current IVD products require FDA approval or clearance, we may in the future develop and commercialize a subset of our products or related applications that could become subject to additional regulation by the FDA. If we market our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, thus subjecting them to additional regulation by the FDA, including premarket and post market control as medical devices, we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance or prior pre-market approval from the FDA before commercializing the product, unless an exemption applies. 
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Outside of the European Union, or EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. 
 FSAP 
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service administer requirements of the Federal Select Agent Program, or FSAP. FSAP requirements govern possession, use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products. It is our policy generally not to produce or otherwise work with material that is subject to FSAP requirements. 
 Export controls 
 International shipments of DNA sequences that we produce are potentially licensable under export controls, although in our experience so far exports of DNA sequences that we have produced have not required licenses. 
 
16 


 Given the evolving nature of our industry, legislative bodies or regulatory authorities may adopt additional regulation or expand existing regulation to include our service. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain comparable regulatory approval or clearance of our service, if required. These regulations and restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
