Item 1. Business
THE COMPANY
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Windstream,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Windstream Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Windstream Services, LLC, and the term “Windstream Services” refers to Windstream Services, LLC and its subsidiaries.
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
Windstream Holdings, Inc. (“Windstream Holdings”) is a publicly traded holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 23, 2013, and the parent of Windstream Services, LLC (“Windstream Services”), a Delaware limited liability company organized on March 1, 2004. Following its delisting on March 6, 2019, Windstream Holdings common stock no longer trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) but trades on the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Pink Sheets market maintained by the OTC Market Group, Inc. under the trading symbol “WINMQ”. Windstream Holdings owns a 100 percent interest in Windstream Services. Windstream Services and its guarantor subsidiaries are the sole obligors of all outstanding debt obligations and, as a result, also file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Windstream Holdings is not a guarantor of nor subject to the restrictive covenants included in any of Windstream Services’ debt agreements. The Windstream Holdings board of directors and officers oversee both companies.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
As further discussed under “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on September 22, 2017, Windstream Services received a purported notice of default under the indenture governing its 6.375 percent senior notes due August 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) from a purported holder of the senior notes, which alleged that Windstream Services had breached certain covenants under the indenture, primarily that the 2015 spin-off constituted a sale and leaseback transaction (as defined in the indenture). On October 12, 2017, the trustee under the indenture filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) seeking a declaration that defaults had occurred under the indenture. On November 6, 2017, Windstream Services received consents from holders representing a majority of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes to certain waivers and amendments to the indenture relating to the defaults alleged in the notice of default in connection with certain exchange and consent transactions completed in 2017. On December 7, 2017, the purported holder issued a notice of acceleration claiming that the principal amount, along with accrued interest, was due and payable immediately. 
Trial in the litigation occurred July 23-25, 2018 and the District Court heard final arguments on July 31, 2018. 
On February 15, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the District Court issued certain findings of fact and conclusions of law (the “Findings”) regarding the 2015 spin-off and 2017 exchange and consent transactions and found that the trustee under the indenture and/or the noteholder are entitled to a judgment in the litigation. 
The Findings resulted in a cross default under Windstream Services’ senior secured credit agreement governing its secured term and revolving loan obligations and remaining obligations under the master lease with Uniti Group, Inc. (“Uniti”). In addition, the acceleration of the 2023 Notes as noted in the Findings resulted in a cross-acceleration event of default under the indentures governing Windstream Services’ other series of secured and unsecured notes. A judgment has not been entered by the District Court.
On February 25, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), Windstream Holdings and all of its subsidiaries, including Windstream Services (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). We intend to use the court-supervised process to address obligations that have been accelerated as a result of the recent decision by Judge Furman against Windstream.
The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases also constitutes an event of default under our debt agreements. Due to the Chapter 11 Cases, however, the creditors’ ability to exercise remedies under our debt agreements were stayed as of the Petition Date, and continue to be stayed. See “Risks Related to Chapter 11 Reorganization” in Item 1A. 
The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re Windstream Holdings, Inc., et al., No 19-22312 (RDD). We will continue to operate our businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 2

In general, as debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code, we are authorized to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to first day motions filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Court authorized us to conduct our business activities in the ordinary course, including, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, authorizing us to obtain debtor-in-possession financing, pay employee wages and benefits, and pay vendors and suppliers in the ordinary course for all goods and services.

OVERVIEW
Windstream is a leading provider of advanced network communications and technology solutions for businesses across the U.S. We also offer broadband, entertainment and security solutions to consumers and small businesses primarily in rural areas in 18 states. Additionally, we supply core transport solutions on a local and long-haul fiber network spanning approximately 150,000 miles.
Our mission is to connect people and empower business in a world of infinite possibilities brought on by rapid technological change. Our vision is to provide innovative software and network solutions while consistently delivering a great customer experience. 
To execute on our mission and achieve our vision, we have four key priorities for 2019:

• | Deliver consistent excellence in the customer experience.

We have made significant investments in our business over the past several years to provide quality service and enhance network reliability and ease of doing business. We will continue to improve collaboration and organizational effectiveness and enhance the day-to-day reliability of our network to drive improvements in the service we provide customers.

• | Achieve differentiation in the marketplace through development of innovative software.

We have reoriented a significant portion of our information technology (“IT”) resources on the development of next-generation software that will create customer solutions as well as internal tools that will enhance our interactions with customers.

• | Continue to position the company for top-line growth.

We have made significant progress transitioning from legacy telecom products and services to next-generation software-enabled products and services with vastly superior capabilities. We will continue to convert existing customers from legacy voice and data products to our strategic products, including SD-WAN, OfficeSuite®, and Kinetic Broadband, that best meet our customers’ communications needs. 

• | Continue to aggressively manage costs.

Our biggest single cash cost consists of interconnection payments we make to other telecommunications carriers to utilize their networks to deliver our products and services to customers. Our annualized interconnection spend is approximately $1.4 billion. We have been aggressively reducing those payments by approximately 10 percent for several years, and we expect this downward trend to continue. At the same time, we will continue to manage all other expenses with rigorous discipline.

Our focused operational strategy for each business segment has the overall objectives to generate strong financial returns for our investors and grow adjusted OIBDA, which is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the impact of the goodwill impairment, merger, integration and other costs, restructuring charges, pension expense and share-based compensation.
We disaggregate our operations between customers located in service areas in which we are the incumbent local exchange carrier (“ILEC”) and provide services over network facilities operated by us and those customers located in service areas in which we are a competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) and provide services primarily over network facilities owned by other carriers. We have further disaggregated our CLEC operations between enterprise and wholesale customers.We also operated a consumer CLEC business, which we sold on December 31, 2018, as further discussed below under “Material Dispositions”. 
Presented below for each of our existing business segments is an overview and further discussion of our operating strategy, product and service offerings, sales and marketing efforts and the competitive landscape in which we operate.
CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS SEGMENT
The Consumer & Small Business segment includes approximately 1.4 million residential and small business customers. This segment generated $1.9 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in contribution margin, or segment income, during 2018.
Strategy
The graph below highlights our significant improvement in broadband customer trends in 2018.
During 2018, we transformed the performance of our core product, consumer broadband. Consumer broadband subscriber trends reversed from years of decline into a growth story as we added over 14,000 new broadband subscribers, compared to a net loss of over 44,000 subscribers in 2017. This accomplishment was driven by a 12 percent year-over-year increase in sales and an 11 percent reduction in customer churn.

The graph below highlights our improved broadband speed capabilities during the past two years. 
We continue to improve broadband speed availability throughout our network through fiber expansion, cost-effective network deployment strategies and deployment of new technologies, such as fixed wireless.
As depicted in the chart below, by the end of 2018, we reached 61 percent of our consumer footprint with speeds of 25 megabits per second (Mbps”) or higher, 39 percent with speeds of 50 Mbps or higher, and 15 percent with speeds of 100 Mbps or higher. Speed expansion is a key part of our consumer strategy for 2019 as well, and we doubled our 100 Mbps speed availability in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, we offer 1-Gigabit per second (“Gbps”) Internet service in 15 states to deliver faster speeds to more of our customer base. Connect America Fund (“CAF”) funding provides support allowing us to further expand our broadband capabilities. 
Our network investments make us more competitive in the marketplace and create a great customer experience, which helps us retain existing customers and grow market share through new customer acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, 41 percent of our consumer broadband customers were on speeds of 25 Mbps or greater. Similarly, our small business strategy centers around investing in our network. During the first quarter of 2019, we will expand the availability of our Kinetic fiber Internet services, which provides speeds up to 1 Gbps, to approximately 100,000 businesses across 16 states.We are marketing both our proprietary TV service and faster speeds under the Kinetic brand, and will expand use of that branding to all of our consumer and small business marketing in early 2019.
Like our consumer experience in 2018, we expect the fiber investments in our business footprint to drive increased sales and lower churn by creating a premium customer experience and enabling more robust solutions for our Kinetic Business product, such as cloud voice services, next-generation networking and affordable business continuity plans. Our network investments will also power bandwidth-intensive applications such as video conferencing, file-sharing and high-definition (“HD”) content consumption.

These services deliver high-speed Internet with competitive speeds, value added services to enhance business productivity and options to bundle services for a holistic business solution to meet our small business customer needs. These product additions will allow us to sell to customers with more sophisticated communications requirements and higher spend levels.
Our ILEC Small Business services include:

• | High-speed Internet access: We offer speeds up to 1 Gbps with an option of high-speed Internet or a dedicated solution.


• | Hosted voice services: OfficeSuite® is an award-winning cloud-based, hosted-voice solution that includes a fully featured phone system, and real-time audio and video communications available from the office phone, computer or on the go with connected smart devices.


• | Software Defined Wide-Area Network: SD-WAN is the next-generation technological wide-area network solution that ensures optimal application performance irrespective of the underlying transport and allows for business continuity as well as routing control via a customer-facing portal.

We also offer a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) compliant option to support our customers in the healthcare industry to maintain compliance with current health standards and regulations.

Small business voice services include a variety of line types available to serve customer needs. We offer a standard business local line, Centrex lines, key systems, private branch exchange (“PBX”) lines, Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”). Additional options for our voice lines include long-distance services, and several calling features, including call waiting, call return, speed calling, caller identification, repeat dialing, three-way calling, rotary hunt, voice mail or rotary hunt voice mail. Our many voice offerings provide customers a wide range of voice solutions to fit the needs of our small business customers.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy is focused on driving top-line revenue growth through stabilizing broadband market share while deepening speed and value-added service penetration for each broadband connection. In our Consumer & Small Business segment, our goal is to win and retain the household or business first and then expand the product participation by consulting on the appropriate speed or value-added services to enhance the experience. We employ the following principles to achieve these goals:

• | Product enhancement: Faster Internet speeds and the geographic expansion of our Kinetic TV footprint deliver more value to consumer customers while growing account revenue. These products not only improve the competitiveness of our offering but drive tangible value to the customer while improving the overall account revenue profile. For small businesses, higher speeds, the introduction of SD-WAN and OfficeSuite® are increasing the value to the customer.


• | Improved customer experience: Continued improvement in the customer experience for both small businesses and consumers is the key to improved retention that drives stabilized market share. We map the customer journey and target initiatives that improve the processes, systems, and policies that impact the manner in which customers interact with us and our products.


• | Product simplification: We sell double and triple play bundle packages to customers at competitive price points, offering high-speed Internet, voice and video services at a better value than when purchasing those services individually or from different providers.

Sales are made through various distribution channels giving new and existing customers choices in how to interact and experience our products and services. We offer customers the opportunity to order service and purchase a number of products designed to enhance our existing services at any of our 23 retail stores located in our local service areas or via our call center-based sales teams. We augment these traditional channels with online sales, national agents, telephone and direct sales representatives. We utilize a similar multi-channel approach for our Small Business sales focusing on a blend of local field sales teams and inbound/outbound call centers to serve this segment.
Competition
We experience intense competition for Consumer & Small Business services. During 2018, consumer households served decreased by approximately 20,900, or 2 percent and small business customers declined by approximately 10,000, or 8 percent. As noted earlier, consumer high-speed Internet customers increased by approximately 14,400, or 1 percent, driven by our ability to offer faster speeds at competitive prices, Sources of competition in our service areas include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Cable television companies: Cable television providers are aggressively offering high-speed Internet, voice and video services in the majority of our service areas. These services are typically bundled and offered to our customers at competitive prices. For small business customers, cable providers leverage discounted TV and broadband pricing to win larger bundles of service.


• | Wireless carriers: Wireless providers primarily compete for voice services in our markets. Consumers continue to disconnect voice service in favor of wireless service. In addition, wireless companies continue to expand their high-speed

 7

Internet offerings, which may provide another alternative for customers, intensifying the level of competition in our markets.

• | Communications carriers: We are required to lease our facilities and capacity to other communications carriers. These companies compete with us by providing voice and high-speed Internet services to both consumers and small businesses located in our ILEC footprint. Additionally, some of the more populated service areas are experiencing new-market entry by communications carriers who are building their own networks to compete for high-speed Internet services.

Approximately 39 percent of our footprint has no national cable overlap. Our focus on upgrading our infrastructure and deploy premium Internet speeds in our Consumer & Small Business markets will improve our competitive positioning and enable us to respond to demand and competitive pressure.
To retain and grow our Consumer & Small Business customer base, we are committed to providing our customers with exceptional service by offering faster broadband speeds and value-added services, while also offering the convenience of bundling those services with voice and video services.
WINDSTREAM ENTERPRISE & WHOLESALE
Our Windstream Enterprise & Wholesale business unit consists of our Enterprise and Wholesale operating segments.
ENTERPRISE SEGMENT
The Enterprise business segment provides advanced network communications and technology solutions to businesses across the continental U.S. During 2018, the Enterprise business generated $2.9 billion in revenue and $628 million in contribution margin. 
Strategy
The strategy for our Enterprise business segment is to increase contribution margin, and over time, grow revenue by expanding our portfolio of next-generation products. In addition, we will expand our metro fiber and fixed wireless network assets, reduce costs and improve the customer experience. As one of the country’s largest service providers with a nationwide network and broad portfolio of next-generation solutions, coupled with a highly responsive service model, we are well positioned to enable our customers transition to the cloud.
We focus on meeting the needs of mid and large-size enterprise customers that consider their network and communication infrastructure as critical in operating their business. We support some of the most demanding IT organizations within the retail, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, government and education sectors. We will continue to focus on these markets in offering solutions tailored to enable businesses to compete more effectively in the digital economy. 
We believe we can continue to drive meaningful improvements in our Enterprise margins by pro-actively migrating our existing customers to new solutions and by attracting new business customers seeking network upgrades required to support their expanding digital strategies.
 8

We will continue to exploit opportunities to leverage our own network facilities to reduce third-party network access costs. We will also continue to improve employee productivity with targeted system and process enhancements. To grow profitability, we are focused on leveraging the latest technology to offer next-generation products that deliver significant value to our customers while also generating strong incremental sales margins. SD-WAN, Unified Communication as a Service (“UCaaS”), OfficeSuite® and related network access products and services comprise our strategic next-generation solutions where we are seeing significant sales and revenue growth. Sales of these strategic products and services comprise 7 percent of total Enterprise revenues and sales, representing an annualized run-rate of $180 million, and these revenues are growing at approximately 70 percent on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we expect to improve operating efficiencies and enhance the customer experience by further integrating our internal processes in sales, service delivery, customer care and repair. Furthermore, we continue to follow an aggressive expense management and capital efficient strategy to drive reductions in network access costs, create on-network sales opportunities and improve our competitiveness in the marketplace.
Services and Products
The drivers of demand are a result of Enterprise businesses transforming their own IT infrastructure to move workloads to the cloud, ensure cloud application performance, improve employee productivity and enhance data security, among other strategic imperatives. Our new portfolio of solutions is uniquely well positioned to support these enterprise IT imperatives. As the network evolves into the platform for how business gets done, our customers increasingly value our tailored solution-design process and dedicated service support model. They subscribe to services such as SD-WAN, UCaaS, Contact Center as a Service (“CCaaS”), fiber transport connectivity to major cloud ecosystems, network security and other managed network services. 

• | SD-WAN: Our next-generation technological wide-area network solution, SD-WAN, ensures optimal application performance irrespective of the underlying transport and allows for business continuity as well as routing control via a customer-facing portal.


• | UCaaS, CCaaS and hosted voice: Our robust UCaaS, CCaaS and hosted voice solution portfolio leverages the latest technology to enable our customers to improve productivity and avoid the upfront capital expense associated with costly PBX systems. OfficeSuite® is an award-winning cloud-based, hosted-voice solution that includes a fully featured phone system, and real-time audio and video communications available from the office phone, computer or on the go with connected smart devices.


• | Multi-site networking: Our advanced network provides private, secure multi-site connections for large businesses with multiple locations. Our core growth networking products include SD-WAN, multiprotocol label switching (“MPLS”), Ethernet - Local Area Network (“LAN”) and Wavelength connectivity solutions.


• | Core Data Transport Services: We will continue to make investments to expand our fiber and fixed wireless networks in metro markets and into other third-party data center facilities. We will also continue to invest in upgrading the capabilities and reach of our core Ethernet services. Through our cloud connectivity offering, we provide secure and highly-scalable connectivity to several cloud ecosystems including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure. We will continue to expand connectivity to additional cloud ecosystems throughout 2019.


• | Integrated voice and data services: Our integrated services deliver voice and data over a single connection, which helps our customers manage voice and data usage and related costs. These services are delivered over an Internet connection, as opposed to a traditional voice line, and can be managed through equipment at the customer premise or through hosted equipment options.


• | Managed services: We provide a breadth of managed services, for both our core networking and UCaaS services, that allow our customers IT organizations to focus on other mission critical activities.


• | High-speed Internet: We offer a range of high-speed broadband Internet access options providing reliable connections designed to help our customers reduce costs and boost productivity.

Sales and Marketing
Our Enterprise sales organization is extensive, with sales offices throughout the United States with more than 500 sales professionals focused on meeting the needs of our customers. 
Sales and marketing activities are conducted through:

• | the direct sales force, which accounts for the majority of our new sales;


• | our dedicated customer advocate team, who focus on pro-actively supporting, retaining and growing existing customers as their needs evolve over time;


• | our indirect sales channel, which partners with third-party dealers who sell directly to customers; and third-party agents, who refer sales of our products and services to our direct sales force.

Competition
The market for enterprise customers is highly competitive. We believe we are well-positioned to gain market share within the mid and large-size enterprise segment based upon our ability to leverage new product capabilities to capitalize on significant industry growth trends: metro and long haul data transport to support cloud connectivity; customer migration from MPLS to hybrid SD-WAN and from premise based PBX to UCaaS; and growing needs for network based security to meet compliance standards. Our national network and expanded product portfolio are complemented by our agility in providing solutions tailored to the unique needs of key verticals - retail, healthcare, commercial banking and hospitality.
Our primary competitors are other communications providers. These providers offer similar services, from traditional voice to advanced data and technology services using similar facilities and technologies as we do, and they compete directly with us for customers of all sizes.
We are focused on improving the customer experience and investing in our network and service offerings to provide our customers with the most technologically advanced solutions available. We believe that many of our largest competitors are focused primarily on serving the largest global enterprises and as a result are increasingly under-serving the middle market. Accordingly, we rely on scalable, customizable solutions and a service model tailored to the mid-market customers to meet their network and communications needs.
WHOLESALE SEGMENT
The Wholesale segment leverages our nationwide network to provide 100 Gbps bandwidth and transport services to wholesale customers, including telecom companies, content providers, and cable and other network operators. The Wholesale business segment produced $723 million in annual revenue and $507 million in contribution margin in 2018.
Strategy
Our Wholesale strategy focuses on monetizing our network investment in strategic, high-traffic locations to drive new sales through the connection of our long-haul network from carrier hotels, international landing stations and data centers to our high fiber density markets. Our sales team continues to target high-growth areas including content, international and cable television providers. Our fiber network connects common interconnection points in tier one locations to our tier two and three markets, enabling our customers to reach their end users through unique and diverse routes. Including network assets acquired through our 2017 acquisitions, our fiber network spans approximately 150,000 route miles of fiber. We have made significant investments in our network adding route miles and new access points to provide advanced Wave and Metro Ethernet Forum (“MEF”) Ethernet services. Furthermore, advancing the service capabilities of our fiber network through Windstream’s use of software-defined networking (“SDN”) will provide our customers with the ability to dynamically configure and control their data networks.
To maintain our contribution margins in our Wholesale business, we will continue to leverage our network assets, offer advanced products and solutions, target our core customers and control costs through our disciplined approach to capital and expense management.
 10

Services and Products
Wholesale services provide network bandwidth to other telecommunications carriers, network operators, and content providers. These services include special access services, which provide access and network transport services to end users, Ethernet and Wave transport up to 100 Gbps, and dark fiber and colocation services. Wholesale services also include fiber-to-the-tower connections to support the wireless backhaul market. In addition, we offer voice and data carrier services to other communications providers and to larger-scale purchasers of network capacity.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to differentiate us from our competitors by providing services in underserved markets with a superior customer experience. Our sales and customer support staff are aligned to work closely with each customer to ensure that the customer’s specific business needs are met. Whether servicing content providers, cable operators, data centers or other communication services providers who require single or multiple circuit connections or may not have sufficient transport network to support their immediate needs, our goal is to exceed customer expectations by providing tailored service and solutions.
Competition
The market for carrier services is highly competitive as continued merger and acquisition activity has resulted in fewer customers and intensified pricing pressure. To improve competitiveness and expand new sales opportunities, we have invested in our network and introduced SDN orchestration to meet the growing demand for 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps bandwidth. Through upgraded network presence in key interconnection points, we are capable of providing Ethernet access and Wave transport services to rural markets, often on unique and diverse routes. By providing a superior customer experience with advanced SDN network technology, we are well-positioned to attract new business and increase market share.
See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Financial Supplement to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional financial information regarding our operating segments.
REGULATION
We are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) for particular interstate matters and state public utility commissions (“PUCs”) for certain intrastate matters. We are also subject to various federal and state statutes that direct such regulations. We actively monitor and participate in proceedings at the FCC and PUCs and engage federal and state legislatures on matters of importance to us. We receive federal and state Universal Service Fund (“USF”) revenues, CAF Phase II support, and funds received from federal access recovery mechanisms (“ARM”). These revenues are included in the operating results of our segments. USF revenues are government subsidies designed to partially offset the cost of providing wireline services in high-cost areas. CAF Phase II funding is administered by the FCC for the purpose of expanding and supporting broadband service in rural areas and effectively replaces frozen USF support in those states in which we elected to receive CAF Phase II funding, as further described below. The ARM is additional federal universal service support available to help mitigate revenue losses from inter-carrier compensation reform not covered by the access recovery charge (“ARC”), a monthly charge assessed to customers established by the FCC.
In August 2015, we notified the FCC of our acceptance of CAF Phase II support of approximately $175 million per year for a six year period to fund the deployment of voice and high-speed Internet capable infrastructures for eligible locations in 17 of the 18 states in which we are the incumbent provider, declining only the annual statewide funding in New Mexico because our projected cost to comply with the FCC’s deployment requirements greatly exceeded the funding offer. The FCC announced the winners of its CAF Phase II competitive bidding process in August, 2018. Windstream was not awarded any bids so it will continue to receive annual USF funding in New Mexico frozen at 2011 levels until the implementation of CAF Phase II award process is complete, which at this time is not known. 
Windstream has actively engaged in policy advocacy in various FCC proceedings that address the rates, terms and conditions for access to the “last-mile” facilities (i.e., business data services (“BDS”) and unbundled network elements (“UNEs”)) we need to serve retail business customers through our competitive companies. For decades, these services had been subject to price caps and other FCC regulation to control for ILEC market power and historical advantages. In April 2017, the FCC adopted comprehensive reforms to its BDS rules (“BDS Order”) and, after an appeal by Windstream, on August 28, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit (the “Court”) generally upheld the FCC’s rules but vacated and remanded the FCC’s finding that transport was sufficiently competitive to deregulate based on a lack of adequate notice. Because the Court granted a stay of its decision until November 12, 2019, Windstream expects the FCC to issue new transport rules by that date. 
 11

Additionally, on May 4, 2018, the United States Telecommunications Association (“USTA”) filed a Petition for Forbearance Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Sec. 160(c) to Accelerate Investment in Broadband and Next-Generation Networks with the FCC. Among other requests, USTA, on behalf of certain of its members, sought relief from the requirement to provide unbundled network elements (“UNEs”) and resale discounts to other telecommunications providers. After successful negotiations, on June 21, 2018, Windstream and the members of USTA filed an ex parte request with the FCC, outlining that they had agreed to a transition time frame for access to UNEs until February 4, 2021, during which transition time Windstream will transition customers from UNEs or otherwise negotiate rates to supersede UNE rates. The parties requested that the FCC consider this a modification of USTA’s original forbearance request. The FCC recently issued a 90-day extension for consideration of this petition, which will now be deemed granted in August 2019 if the FCC takes no further action. 
From time to time, federal and state legislation is introduced dealing with various matters that could affect our business. Most proposed legislation of this type never becomes law. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict what kind of legislation, if any, may be introduced and ultimately become law.

No single customer, or group of related customers, represented 10 percent or more of our annual operating revenues during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018.
SEASONALITY
Our business is not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.
NETWORK
We are redefining the way we design and operate our network to meet the rapidly evolving digital needs of our customers. We have redirected our network strategy toward being more software-centric as we focus on creating and managing software-defined customer solutions, while fostering an agile, innovative culture to quickly deliver the right solutions to our customers. Across our 150,000 miles of fiber optic network, we maintain a calibrated balance between building future network capabilities and maintaining the valued legacy network elements to further enhance network diversity and reliability.
The transport layer of our network has been strategically designed into multiple domains, consisting of access, metro, metro-core and long-haul. Our investments to modernize the network will enable us to provide software-defined solutions that are more efficient to deploy and operate. Software-developed tools will also create efficiencies and improve reliability for legacy network elements.
The next generation IP layer contains segmentation of critical elements and routes, producing extremely high-levels of availability between core and edge routers. Similar architectures exist at the higher layers as well, as we regionalize and diversify video, VOIP, security, and SD-WAN network elements. Multi-layer orchestration has been (and will continue to be) developed to effectively reduce cycle time while improving the reliability of the process.
For those opportunities where we have limited network assets, strategic service agreements are implemented for last-mile connections to extend our ability to serve the business customers that are not located directly on our network. These connections link our business customers to our facilities-based network and products.

ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2018 and 2017
On August 31, 2018, Windstream Holdings completed its acquisition of American Telephone Company, LLC (“ATC”), a reseller of a broad range of voice and data communications services to businesses mainly headquartered in the greater New York metropolitan area, for initial cash consideration of approximately $10 million, net of cash acquired. The transaction reflects our strategy to augment organic revenue growth with small, customer-base acquisitions. 
On March 27, 2018, Windstream Holdings acquired MASS Communications (“MASS”), a privately held telecommunications network management company focused on providing custom engineered voice, data and networking solutions to small and mid-sized global enterprises in the financial, legal, healthcare, technology, education and government sectors, for $37.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
On July 28, 2017, Windstream Holdings completed its merger with Broadview Networks Holdings, Inc. (“Broadview”), a leading provider of cloud-based unified communications solutions to small and medium-sized businesses and offers a broad suite of cloud-based services. Broadview’s proprietary OfficeSuite® and unified communications platforms are complementary to our existing SD-WAN product offering. In addition, Broadview has an experienced sales force and strong channel partner program, which we will leverage to sell unified communications services across our small business and mid-market enterprise customer bases. In the merger, Windstream added approximately 20,000 small and medium-sized business customers and approximately 3,000 incremental route fiber miles. Windstream Services paid $69.8 million in cash to Broadview shareholders and assumed $160.2 million of Broadview’s short-term debt obligations, which Windstream Services subsequently repaid. The transaction was valued at approximately $230.0 million. 
On February 27, 2017, Windstream Holdings completed its merger with EarthLink Holdings Corp. (“EarthLink”), a leading provider of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers and nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. In the merger, Windstream added approximately 700,000 customers and approximately 16,000 incremental route fiber miles. In effecting the merger, each share of EarthLink common stock was exchanged for .1636 shares of Windstream Holdings common stock, on a post-reverse stock split basis. In the aggregate, Windstream Holdings issued approximately 18.6 million shares of its common stock and assumed approximately $435.3 million of EarthLink’s long-term debt, which we subsequently refinanced, in a transaction valued at approximately $1.1 billion.

In completing these acquisitions, we have increased our operating scale and scope giving us the ability to offer customers expanded products, services and enhanced enterprise solutions over an extensive national footprint now spanning approximately 150,000 fiber route miles. We also expect to achieve operating and capital expense synergies in integrating the operations of MASS, Broadview and EarthLink. For additional information regarding these acquisitions see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Financial Supplement to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
MATERIAL DISPOSITIONS
Sale of Consumer CLEC Business - On December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of substantially all of our consumer competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) business to an affiliate of Trive Capital Fund III LLP and nQue Technologies for $320.9 million in cash, net of a working capital adjustment. The consumer operations sold consisted solely of the former EarthLink consumer business that we acquired in February 2017.
Sale of Data Center Business - On December 18, 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial portion of our data center business to TierPoint LLC (“TierPoint”) for $575.0 million in cash. In the transaction, TierPoint acquired 14 of Windstream’s 27 data centers, including data centers located in Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. The remaining data centers retained by us are primarily shared colocation facilities. As part of the transaction, we established an ongoing reciprocal strategic partnership with TierPoint, allowing both companies to sell their respective products and services to each other’s prospective customers through referrals.
Spin-off of Certain Network and Real Estate Assets - On April 24, 2015, we completed the spin-off of certain telecommunications network assets, including our fiber and copper networks and other real estate, into an independent, publicly traded real estate investment trust. The spin-off also included substantially all of our consumer CLEC business as of that time. The telecommunications network assets consisted of copper cable and fiber optic cable lines, telephone poles, underground conduits, concrete pads, attachment hardware (e.g., bolts and lashings), pedestals, guy wires, anchors, signal repeaters, and central office land and buildings, with a net book value of approximately $2.5 billion at the time of spin-off. We requested and received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on the qualification of the spin-off as a tax-free transaction and the designation of the telecommunications network assets as real estate.
Pursuant to the plan of distribution and immediately prior to the effective time of the spin-off, we contributed the telecommunications network assets and the consumer CLEC business to Uniti formerly Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Windstream, in exchange for: (i) the issuance to Windstream of Uniti common stock of which 80.4 percent of the shares were distributed on a pro rata basis to Windstream’s stockholders, (ii) cash payment to Windstream in the amount of $1.035 billion and (iii) the distribution by Uniti to Windstream of approximately $2.5 billion of Uniti debt securities. After giving effect to the interest in Uniti retained by Windstream, each Windstream Holdings shareholder received one share of Uniti for every five shares of Windstream Holdings common stock in the form of a tax-free dividend. On April 24, 2015, following the completion of the spin-off, we transferred the Uniti debt securities and cash to two investment banks, in exchange for approximately $2.5 billion of debt securities of Windstream Services held by the investment banks.
As of the spin-off date, excluding restricted shares held by Windstream employees and directors, Windstream retained a passive ownership interest in approximately 19.6 percent of the common stock of Uniti. In two separate transactions completed in June 2016, Windstream Services transferred all of its shares of Uniti common stock to its bank creditors in exchange for the retirement of $672.0 million of aggregate borrowings outstanding under its revolving line of credit and to satisfy transaction-related expenses.
