ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
We are one of the largest public homebuilders in the United States. We are also a land developer, with a portfolio of lifestyle and master-planned communities. We provide a diverse assortment of homes across a wide range of price points. We strive to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers in traditionally high growth markets, where we design, build and sell single-family detached and attached homes. We operate under the Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding, LLC (“TMHF”) and title insurance and closing settlement services through our title company, Inspired Title Services, LLC (“Inspired Title”).
We have operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina and Texas. Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components and a mortgage and title services component, which are managed as multiple reportable segments, as follows:

East | Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Orlando, Raleigh, Southwest Florida, and Tampa 
Central | Austin, Dallas and Houston (both include a Taylor Morrison division and a Darling Homes division) and Denver
West | Bay Area, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Southern California 
Mortgage Operations | Taylor Morrison Home Funding (“TMHF”) and Inspired Title Services, LLC (“Inspired Title”) 

Over the last several years we have grown organically and through various builder acquisitions, including our acquisition in April 2015 of JEH Homes, an Atlanta based homebuilder; our acquisition in July 2015 of three divisions of Orleans Homes in new markets within Charlotte, Chicago and Raleigh; and our acquisition in January 2016 of Acadia Homes in Atlanta. Each of these acquisitions represents our strategic approach in expanding our geographic footprint in new, high-growth markets. 
Organizational Structure
As a result of the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”) April 12, 2013 and a series of transactions pursuant to a Reorganization Agreement dated as of April 9, 2013, TMHC formed and became the owner and general partner of New TMM. New TMM was formed by a consortium of investors comprised of affiliates of TPG Global, LLC (the “TPG Entities” or “TPG”), investment funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) or their respective subsidiaries (together, the “Oaktree Entities”), and affiliates of JH Investments, Inc. (“JH” and together with the TPG Entities and Oaktree Entities, the “Principal Equityholders”). 
Since January 2017, we have completed seven public offerings for an aggregate of 80.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, using all of the net proceeds therefrom to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. In January 2018, we also purchased an additional 7.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock from our Principal Equityholders. As a result of the series of offerings and repurchases, the Principal Equityholders ownership decreased to 31.1% at December 31, 2017 and to zero by January 31, 2018.

Business Strategy
Our long-term strategy is built on four pillars:

• | pursuing core locations;


• | building distinctive communities;


• | maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and


• | appropriately balancing price with pace in the sale of our homes.

We are committed to building authentic homes and communities that inspire and enhance the lives of our customers. Delivering on this involves thoughtful design and research to accommodate the needs of our various customers and the surrounding community. The Taylor Morrison difference begins by providing our customers with homes that are both conducive to their lifestyles and built to last, prioritizing our commitment for the long-term satisfaction of our homeowners. Our communities are generally “lifestyle” communities in core locations, which have various distinguishing attributes, including proximity to job centers, attractive school systems and a variety of local amenities in well-regarded submarkets.
Our dedication to service defines our customer experience and acknowledges homeowners’ suggestions to incorporate style, quality and sustainability into every community we develop. We offer a range of award-winning and innovative designs with a number of features such as single-story, ranch style living, split bedroom plans and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to diverse buyer needs. We engage unaffiliated architectural firms and internal architectural resources to develop and augment existing plans in order to ensure that our homes reflect current and local consumer tastes. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency and cost savings to reduce the impact on the environment. We serve all segments and generational groups through our quality products which attract entry-level, move-up, luxury and active adult buyers. 
We acquire our land assets in core locations, focusing on the preferences of our buyers, building desirable communities, continually evaluating and analyzing overhead efficiency and optimizing profit by managing volume. In addition, we seek to maximize long-term shareholder value and operate our business to capitalize on market appreciation and mitigate risks from economic downturns as we recognize the cyclical nature of the housing market and home price volatility. We regularly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder return. We also take advantage of joint venture opportunities as they arise in order to secure prime assets, share risk and maximize returns.
We believe our extensive land position and pipeline have positioned us for strategic growth and increased profitability in an improving housing market. We execute this strategy by:
3


• | Maximizing our existing land supply through enhanced product offerings;


• | Combining land acquisition and development expertise with homebuilding operations;


• | Focusing product offerings on specific customer groups;


• | Building aspirational homes for our customers and delivering superior customer service;


• | Maintaining an efficient capital structure;


• | Selectively pursuing acquisitions; and


• | Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record.

Land and Development Strategies
Community development includes the acquisition and development of communities, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. We generally operate as community developers, but in some communities we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case, we acquire fully planned and entitled lots and may construct on-site improvements. 
In order to maximize our expected risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Our portfolio investment committee of senior executives meets on a regular basis. Annually, our operating divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographies. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Supply and demand are analyzed on a consumer segment and submarket basis to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary. Major development strategy decisions regarding community positioning are included in the decision making and underwriting process and are made in consultation with senior executives of our management team. Our land portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below:

Total | 7,142 | | 8,037 | | 11,318 | | 1,489 | | 27,986 | 10,319 | 38,305

Raw land represents property that has not been developed and remains in its natural state. Partially developed represents land where the grading and horizontal development process has begun. Finished lots represent those lots which we have purchased 
4

from third parties in addition to lots for which we have completed the horizontal development and are ready for the vertical or homebuilding construction. Long-term strategic assets are those lots where we are currently not performing any development.
In the land purchasing and/or joint venture configuration process, specific projects of interest are typically identified by the local divisional teams, including proposed ownership structure, environmental concerns, anticipated product segmentation, competitive environment and financial returns, and they are presented to our portfolio investment committee for review. Certain portfolio opportunities will often be sourced centrally and managed at the corporate level. We also determine whether continued spending on currently owned and controlled land is a well-timed and appropriate use of capital. Our portfolio investment strategy emphasizes expected profitability to reflect the risk and timing of returns, and the level of sales volume in new and existing markets.
The following is a summary of the status of our land positions:

Homes in Inventory
We manage our inventory of homes under construction by selectively commencing construction to capture new home demand, while monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes.

The following is a summary of our homes in inventory by homebuilding reporting segment as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:
 
 | As of December 31, 2017 | As of December 31, 2016
 | Homes inBacklog | Models | | Inventoryto be Sold | Total | Homes inBacklog | | Models | Inventoryto be Sold | Total

Total | 3,496 | | 390 | | 1,433 | | 5,319 | | 3,131 | | 412 | 1,186 | 4,729

We expect that during 2018 we will deliver substantially all homes in backlog at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, inventory units to be sold included 222 completed units available for sale. On average at December 31, 2017, we had 4.8 inventory units per average active selling community and 0.75 completed inventory units per average active selling community to be sold. At December 31, 2016, inventory units to be sold included 238 completed units available for sale. On average at December 31, 2016, we had 3.8 inventory units per average active selling community and 0.77 completed inventory units per average active selling community. 
Community Development
We create a complete concept for each community, beginning with an overall community layout and then determine the size, style and price range of the homes, the layout of the streets and positioning of the individual home sites. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we improve the land by clearing and grading, installing roads, underground utility lines, staking out individual home sites and, in certain communities, erecting distinctive entrance structures and recreational amenities.
Each community has employees who perform superintendent, sales and customer service functions, in conjunction with a local management team to manage the overall project.
The life cycle of a community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of land, continuing through the land development phase, and concluding with the sale, construction, and delivery of homes. Actual life cycle will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as developed lots.
The construction time for our homes varies from project to project depending on geographic region, the time of year, the size and complexity of construction, the governmental approval processes, local labor availability, availability of materials and supplies, weather, and other factors. On average, we complete the construction of a typical home in approximately six months.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct a home. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. We generally have multiple sources for the materials we purchase and have not experienced significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials.
Trades and Labor
Our construction, land and purchasing teams coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We are a general contractor for all of our homebuilding projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices can be challenging in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth and other economic factors that affect the number of people in the workforce.
6

Procurement and Construction
We have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and national presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize cost and process efficiencies on local, regional and national levels and to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements.
The regional and national vendor programs currently involve over 50 vendors and include highly reputable and well-established companies who supply us with lumber, appliances, HVAC systems, insulation, roofing, paint and lighting, among other materials. Through these relationships, we are able to realize savings on the costs of essential materials. Contracts are typically structured to include a blend of attractive upfront pricing and rebates and, in some cases, advantageous retroactive pricing in instances of contract renewals. In addition to cost advantages, these arrangements also help minimize the risk of construction delays during supply shortages, as we are often able to leverage our size to obtain our full allocation of required materials.
Warranty Program
Most of our divisions currently offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. Certain of our divisions provide longer term structural warranties through third-party warranty providers. We also currently provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration regulations. We evaluate our warranty offerings from time-to-time and, in the future, may offer the third-party longer term structural warranty in additional divisions and potentially across the Company.
Sales and Marketing
We are committed to continuously enhancing our customer experience including how we target and attract our consumers. Our marketing program calls for a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our corporate sales and marketing team provides a generalized marketing framework across our regional operations as well as sales training to our local teams. Our divisional sales and marketing teams utilize local media and marketing channels to deliver a unique message that is relevant to our consumer groups in each market.
Our goal is to identify the preferences of our customers and demographic groups and offer them innovative, high-quality homes that are efficient and profitable to build. We strive to maintain product and price level differentiation through market and customer research. We target a balance of regional market portfolios across a variety of demographics. We also use key indicators of market specific supply and demand characteristics to determine preferences of our customer base and to perform an optimal matching of consumer groups, product and community design, and specific location. 
The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.taylormorrison.com and www.darlinghomes.com (none of the information on or accessible through these websites is a part of this Annual Report). The main purpose of these websites is to direct potential customers to our sales team members in their community of interest. The websites also offer the ability of customers to evaluate floor plans, elevations, square footage, community amenities and geographic location. Customers are also able to use the websites to make inquiries and to receive a prompt response from one of our “Internet Home Consultants.” The websites are fully integrated with our CRM system. By analyzing the content of the CRM, we are able to focus our lead generation programs to deliver high-quality sales leads. With these leads we are better able to increase sale conversion rates and lower marketing costs. We believe the digital marketing strategy for our websites, which is continually reviewed and refined, provides high return on our investments. During 2017, we commissioned a full analysis of our websites. This included all stakeholders as well as consumer facing research designed to provide an industry leading digital presence in 2018 and beyond. Management anticipates implementation of our new sites to be complete by the end of 2018. 
We selectively utilize print, radio and television for advertising purposes, including directional marketing, newspapers and billboards. We also directly notify local real estate agents and firms of any new community openings in order to use the existing real estate agent/broker channels in each market. Pricing for our homes is evaluated weekly based on an analysis of market conditions, competitive environment and supply and demand characteristics.
7

We use furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate the advantages of the designs, features and functionality of our homes. We generally employ or contract with interior and landscape designers who create attractive model homes that highlight the features and options available for the homes within our communities. Depending upon the number of homes to be built in the project and the product lines to be offered, we generally build between one and three model homes for each active selling community. 
Our homes are sold by our commissioned employees who work from sales offices generally located within our model homes. Our goal is to ensure our sales force has extensive knowledge of our homes, including our energy efficient features, sales strategies, mortgage options and community dynamics. To achieve this goal, we have on-going training for our sales team and conduct regular meetings to keep them abreast of the latest promotions, options and sales techniques and discuss geographic competition. Our sales team members are licensed real estate agents where required by law and assist our customers in adding design features to their homes, which we believe appeal to local consumer preferences. Third-party brokers who sell our homes are generally paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. In some of our divisions, we contract with third-party design studios that specialize in assisting our homebuyers with options and upgrades to personalize their homes. Utilizing these third-party design studios allows us to manage our overhead and costs more efficiently. We may also offer various sales incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades. The use, types and amount of incentives depends largely on existing economic and local competitive market conditions.
Competition
The homebuilding business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of location, design, quality, service, price and reputation.
In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal. We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. We generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Our results, therefore, may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:

• | the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects;


• | the timing of sales;


• | the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels;


• | the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction;


• | the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate;


• | mix of homes closed;


• | construction timetables;


• | the cost and availability of materials and labor; and


• | weather conditions in the markets in which we build.

8

As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position are not necessarily representative of a full fiscal year. To illustrate the seasonality in net homes sold, homes closed and home closings revenue, a summary of the quarterly financial data follows:


 | Three Months Ended, | | | Three Months Ended,

Mortgage Operations
TMHF provides a number of mortgage-related services to our customers through our mortgage lending operations. The strategic purpose of TMHF is:

• | to utilize mortgage finance as a sales tool in the purchase process to ensure a consistent customer experience and assist in maintaining production efficiency; and


• | to control and analyze our backlog quality and to better manage projected closing and delivery dates for our customers.

TMHF operates as an independent mortgage banker and conducts its business as a FHA Full Eagle lender. TMHF funds mortgage loans utilizing warehouse credit facilities. Revenue is earned through origination and processing fees combined with service release premiums earned in the secondary market once the loans are sold to investors. Typically, loans are sold and servicing is released within 15-20 business days.
TMHF competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. TMHF utilizes a multi-investor correspondent platform which gives us increased flexibility when placing loans to meet our customers’ needs. TMHF has continued to expand and strengthen our correspondent relationships. This has created stability and consistency in our origination process and delivery. 
Inspired Title operates as a title insurance agent under the title-only (examination) business model. Inspired Title searches and examines land title records, prepares title commitments and polices for homebuyers in our Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas markets, contracting with others (currently title insurance underwriters and attorneys) to perform the escrow closing functions. Inspired Title competes against other title underwriters and title/escrow agents that provide similar services. 
Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Regulatory
We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as open space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has been to increase our overall costs, and may delay the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded 
9

entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.
TMHF is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans. Certain requirements provided for by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") have not yet been finalized or fully implemented. The effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators.
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, Veterans Administration-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state.
Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.
Environmental
We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, “environmental laws”). For example, environmental laws may affect: how we manage stormwater runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocation, and other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage, or other losses. 
As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties. To date, environmental site assessments conducted at our properties have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity or results of operations, nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns.
We manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance from the corporate and regional legal departments.
Health and Safety

performance throughout our operating areas meeting or exceeding expectations. All of our team members must complete an assigned curriculum of online safety courses each year. These courses vary according to job responsibility. In addition, groups such as construction and field personnel are required to attend additional health and safety related training programs. 
Information Technology
We have a centralized information technology organization with its core team located at our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, augmented with field support technicians in key locations across the U.S. Our approach to information technology is to continuously simplify our information technology platform and consolidate and standardize applications. We believe a common application platform enables the sharing of ideas and rapid implementation of process improvements and best practices across the entire company. Our back-office operations use a fully integrated, industry recognized enterprise resource planning package. Marketing and field sales utilize a leading CRM solution that tracks leads and prospects from all sources and manages the customer communication process from lead creation through the buying process and beyond the post-warranty period. Field operations teams collaborate with our supply chain management to schedule and manage development and construction projects with a set of standard and widely used homebuilding industry solutions.
Intellectual Property
We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,800 full-time equivalent persons. Of these, approximately 1,600 were engaged in corporate and homebuilding operations, and the remaining approximately 200 were engaged in mortgage and title services. As of December 31, 2017, we were not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are supervised by our project managers and field superintendents who manage third party subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for some architectural, engineering, advertising and legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
