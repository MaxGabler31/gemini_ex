Company Overview
EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction-processing business in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and Latin America, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services. We believe that we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean. We serve 26 countries out of 11 offices, including our headquarters in Puerto Rico. We own and operate the ATH network, which we believe is one of the leading personal identification number (“PIN”) debit networks in Latin America. We manage a system of electronic payment networks and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core banking, cash processing, and fulfillment in Puerto Rico, that process over three billion transactions annually. Additionally, we offer technology outsourcing in all the regions we serve. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations, and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region. 
We are differentiated, in part, by our diversified business model, which enables us to provide our varied customer base with a broad range of transaction-processing services from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets. We believe this capability provides several competitive advantages that will enable us to continue to penetrate our existing customer base with complementary new services, win new customers, develop new sales channels, and enter new markets. We believe these competitive advantages include:

•Our ability to provide competitive products; 
•Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors; 
•Our ability to leverage proprietary IP that enables us to be nimble and flexible when it comes to client requirements;
•Our ability to put forth Spanish speaking developers in front of our Spanish speaking customers making communication much more effective and integrations more efficient;
•Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations across several geographies with technology solutions that enable them to manage their business as one enterprise; and 
•Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction-processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction-processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment services). 
Our broad suite of services spans the entire transaction-processing value chain and includes a range of front-end customer-facing solutions such as the electronic capture and authorization of transactions at the point-of-sale, as well as back-end support services such as the clearing and settlement of transactions and account reconciliation for card issuers. These include: (i) merchant acquiring services, which enable point of sales (“POS”) and e-commerce merchants to accept and process electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefit transfer (“EBT”) cards; (ii) payment processing services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (“ATM”) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide “mission-critical” technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments. We provide these services through scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that we manage and operate in-house and that generate significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability. 
We sell and distribute our services primarily through a proprietary direct sales force with established customer relationships. We continue to pursue joint ventures and merchant acquiring alliances. We benefit from an attractive business model, the hallmarks of which are recurring revenue, scalability, significant operating margins, and moderate capital expenditure requirements. Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally negotiate multi-year contracts with our customers. We believe our business model should enable us to continue to grow our business organically in the primary markets we serve without significant incremental capital expenditures.
As of December 31, 2021, Popular, Inc. (Nasdaq: BPOP) ("Popular") owned approximately 16.2% of our common stock and was our largest shareholder. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 42% of our revenue was generated from our relationship with Popular. The revenue concentration with Popular makes our MSA with them our most significant client contract. On February 24, 2022, we announced that we entered into an agreement to modify and extend the main commercial agreements with Popular that had an initial term ending in 2025, including the MSA. We also entered into an agreement to sell Popular certain assets in exchange for Popular owned Evertec stock ("Popular Transaction"). As part of this transaction, Popular has agreed to take certain actions after closing to ensure that Evertec is no longer deemed a “subsidiary” of Popular for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, including reducing their voting interest in Evertec to 4.5% over a period of three months after the close of the transaction through either the sale of shares or conversion to non-voting preferred shares.
 See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Relationship with Popular.”
Industry Trends
Accelerated Shift to Digital Payment Methods
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer preference has accelerated its shift away from cash and paper payment methods, noting increased demand for omni-channel payment services that facilitate cashless and contactless transactions. The ongoing migration to digital payment methods continues to benefit the transaction-processing industry globally. Technologies such as contactless payments, tap-on-phone, mobile commerce, “e-wallets” and advanced and smart POS devices continue to drive the shift away from cash and other traditional payment methods. The Company has benefited from an increase in transaction volumes for these types of payment solutions. As consumers and merchants increase demand for contactless and mobility-based solutions, the Company has continued to innovate and invest, expanding the footprint and functionality of digital solutions such as Placetopay (e-commerce gateway), our wallet ATH Movil and ATH Business, and Paystudio our issuing and acquiring processing platform. We believe that the ongoing shift to digital payments will continue to generate substantial growth opportunities for our business. 
The digital payments space is experiencing rapid and disruptive technological innovation which has been accelerated by the ongoing pandemic and the resulting shift in consumer preferences and merchant demands. 
Fast Growing Latin American and Caribbean Financial Services and Payments Markets
The markets in which we operate, particularly in the Latin American and Caribbean region continue to grow and consumer preference is driving an increase for electronic payments usage. Non-cash transaction volumes in Latin America have grown from 40.9 billion in 2016 to 57.2 billion in 2020 according to the 2021 World Payments report, representing a compound annual growth rate of 8.7%. Increase in demand for contactless technology, QR code payments and instant payment-based transfers is one of the main drivers for this growth. Latin America is one of the fastest-growing mobile markets globally, with a growing base of tech-savvy customers that demonstrate a preference for credit cards, digital wallets, contactless payments, and other value-added offerings. Non-cash markets in Latin America are expected to continue their accelerated growth, with non-cash transactions expected to reach over 100 billion in 2025, a growth rate of 14.1% from 2020 to 2025. The region's FinTech sector is driving change via new contactless payment technology that are becoming popular alternatives to cash payments. We continue to believe that the attractive characteristics of our markets and our position across multiple services and sectors will continue to drive growth and profitability in our businesses.
Ongoing Technology Outsourcing Trends
We benefit from the trend of financial institutions and government agencies outsourcing technology systems and processes. Financial institutions globally are facing significant challenges including the entrance of non-traditional competitors, the 
compression of margins on traditional products, significant channel proliferation and increasing regulation that could potentially curb profitability. Many of these institutions have traditionally fulfilled their IT needs through legacy computer systems, operated by the institution itself. Legacy systems are generally highly proprietary, inflexible, and costly to operate and maintain. Many medium and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for the Company. 
Our Competitive Strengths
Market Leadership in Latin America and the Caribbean
We believe we have an inherent competitive advantage relative to competitors based on our first-hand knowledge of the Latin American and Caribbean markets and technology needs, language, and culture. We have built leadership positions across the transaction-processing value chain and the financial technology space in the key geographic markets that we serve, which we believe will enable us to continue to penetrate our core markets and provide advantages to enter new ones. We are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions. We own and operate the ATH network, which we believe is one of the leading ATM and PIN debit networks in Latin America. EVERTEC processed over three billion transactions in 2021. According to management's estimates, ATH branded products are the most frequently used electronic method of payment in Puerto Rico. Our scale and customer base of top tier financial institutions and government entities ensures we are the leading card issuer and core bank processors in the Caribbean and the only non-bank provider of cash processing services to the U.S. Federal Reserve in the Caribbean. We believe our competitive position and brand recognition increases card acceptance, driving usage of our proprietary network, and presents opportunities for future strategic relationships.
Broad and Deep Customer Relationships and Recurring Revenue Business Model
We have built a strong and long-standing portfolio of financial institution, merchant, fintech, corporate and government customers across Latin America and the Caribbean, which provides us with a reliable, recurring revenue base and powerful references that have helped us expand into new channels and geographic markets. Our Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean, Payment Services - Latin America and Merchant Acquiring segments, as well as certain business lines representing the majority of our business solutions segment, generate recurring revenues that collectively accounted for approximately 95% of our total revenues in 2021. We receive recurring revenues from services based on our customers’ on-going daily commercial activity such as processing loans, hosting accounts and information on our servers, and processing everyday payments at grocery stores, gas stations and similar establishments. We generally provide these services under one to five-year contracts, often with automatic renewals. We also provide a few project-based services that generate non-recurring revenues in our business solutions segment and our Payment Services - Latin America segment, such as IT consulting for a specific project or integration or one-time license sales. Additionally, we provide a number of critical payment services, core baking services and business solutions products and services to Popular as part of the 15-year MSA entered into on September 30, 2010 and benefit from the bank’s distribution network and continued support. Through our long-standing and diverse customer relationships, we are able to gain valuable insight into trends in the marketplace that allows us to identify new market opportunities. In addition, we believe the recurring nature of our business model provides us with revenue and earnings stability. 
Highly Scalable, End-to-End Technology Platform
Our diversified business model is supported by our scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that allow us to provide a broad range of transaction-processing services and develop and deploy technology solutions to our customers at low incremental costs and increasing operating efficiencies. We have spent over $251 million over the last five years on technology investments, including POS terminals, to continue building the capacity and functionality of our platforms and we have been able to achieve attractive economies of scale with flexible product development capabilities. We believe that our platforms will allow us to provide differentiated services to our customers and facilitate further expansion into new sales channels and geographic markets. 
Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record of Execution
We have grown our revenue organically by introducing new products and services and expanding our geographic footprint throughout Latin America. We have a proven track record of creating value from operational and technology improvements and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. EVERTEC's management team brings many years of industry experience, with long-standing leadership at the operating business level and collectively benefits from an average of over 20 years of industry experience. We believe our leadership team is well positioned to continue to drive growth across business lines and regions. 
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our business by continuing to execute on the following business strategies:
Continue Cross-Sales to Existing Customers
We seek to grow revenue by continuing to sell additional products and services to our existing merchant, financial institution, corporate and government customers. We intend to broaden and deepen our customer relationships by leveraging our full suite of end-to-end technology solutions. For example, we believe that there is opportunity to cross-sell our payment gateway product; card issuing and acquiring platforms and services; network services; ATM and point-of-sale processing services, and payment and collection platforms, and our risk management products to existing financial institution customers, particularly in markets outside of Puerto Rico. We will also seek to continue to cross-sell value-added services into our existing merchant base. 
Leverage Our Franchise to Attract New Customers in the Markets We Currently Serve
We intend to attract new customers by leveraging our comprehensive product and services offering, the strength of our brand and our leading end-to-end technology platform. Furthermore, we believe we are well positioned to develop new products and services and to take advantage of our access to and position in markets we currently serve. For example, in markets we serve outside of Puerto Rico, we believe there is a good opportunity to penetrate small to medium and some larger financial institutions, fintech companies and medium to large retailers with our products and services.
Expand in the Latin America Region
We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand our businesses in the Latin American region. We believe that we have a competitive advantage relative to competitors based on our first-hand knowledge of the Latin American and Caribbean markets and their technological needs, our physical presence in the region, language, and culture. We believe significant growth opportunities exist in a number of large markets such as Colombia, México, and Chile, among others. We also believe that there is an opportunity to provide our services to existing fintech and financial institution customers in other regions where they operate. Additionally, we continually evaluate our strategic plans for geographic expansion, which can be achieved through strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, or alliances. For a description of risks associated with obtaining regulatory approvals and other risks associated with strategic transactions, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Failure to comply with existing and future rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect the operations of one or more of our businesses in those jurisdictions.” 
Develop New Products and Services
At the core of Evertec’s value proposition is innovation. We have to take advantage of the changing consumer and market dynamics and build innovative solutions for our clients. Our close relationship with customers and deep understanding of the markets where we operate, together with a proprietary intellectual property around our products and offerings, allow Evertec to continuously explore and develop new products and services that tend to our customer’s needs. 
We plan to continue investing and growing our merchant, financial institution, fintech, corporate and government customer base by investing in core products, including (i) processing platforms, such as Paystudio, (ii) data and fraud management solutions, such as Risk Center, Scudo and 3DS, (iii) merchant capture channels, such as ATH Movil for person-to-person, and person-to-merchant digital transactions, pvot for Smart POS and Placetopay for card-not-present and omni-channel experiences. We also invest in value-added services such as API enablement, tokenization, loyalty, digital on-boarding, and predictive models. We intend to continue to focus on these and other new product opportunities in order to take advantage of our leadership position in the transaction-processing and financial services industry in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
Our Business
We offer our customers end-to-end products and solutions across the transaction-processing value chain from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets, as further described below.
Merchant Acquiring
Our merchant acquiring business provides services to merchants that allow them to accept electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and EBT cards carrying the ATH, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express brands. Our full suite of merchant acquiring services includes, but is not limited to, the underwriting of each merchant’s contract, the deployment and rental of POS devices and other equipment necessary to capture merchant transactions, the processing of transactions at the point-of-sale, processing of transactions digitally through our online payment gateway, the settlement of funds with the participating financial institution, detailed sales reports, and customer support. In 2021, our merchant acquiring business processed over 474 million transactions.
Payment Services 
We believe we are the largest card processor and card network service provider in the Caribbean. We provide a diversified suite of payment processing products and services to blue chip regional and global corporate customers, government agencies, and financial institutions across Latin America and the Caribbean. These services provide our clients with the technology necessary to facilitate the processing and routing of payments across the transaction-processing value chain. 
At the point-of-sale, we sell transaction-processing technology solutions, similar to the services in our merchant acquiring business, to other merchant acquirers enabling them to service their own merchant customers. We also offer terminal driving solutions to merchants, merchant acquirers (including our merchant acquiring business) and financial institutions, which provide the technology to securely operate, manage and monitor POS terminals and ATMs. We also rent POS devices to financial institution customers who seek to deploy them across their own businesses. 
To connect the merchants to card issuers, we own and operate the ATH network, which we believe is one of the leading ATM and PIN debit networks in Latin America. The ATH network connects the merchant or merchant acquirer to the card issuer and enables transactions to be routed or “switched” across the transaction-processing value chain. The ATH network offers the technology, communications standards, rules and procedures, security and encryption, funds settlement and common branding that allow consumers, merchants, merchant acquirers, ATMs, card issuer processors and card issuers to conduct commerce seamlessly, across a variety of channels, similar to the services provided by Visa and MasterCard. We also own and operate ATH Movil and ATH Business which is an ATH network application that allows individuals to (i) transfer money instantly to individuals and merchants using only their phone number, and (ii) transfer money between an individual's registered cards. ATH Business enables businesses through the download of the application to accept payments instantly for their services or products from individuals with ATH Movil in real time and to donate to non-profit organizations. The ATH network and payment processing businesses processed approximately two billion transactions in 2021.
To enable financial institutions, governments and other businesses to issue and operate a range of payment products and services, we offer an array of card processing and other payment technology services, such as internet and mobile banking software services, bill payment systems and EBT solutions. Financial institutions and certain retailers outsource to us certain card processing services such as card issuance, processing card applications, cardholder account maintenance, transaction authorization and posting, high volume payment processing fraud and risk management services, and settlement. Our payment products include electronic check processing, automated clearing house (“ACH”), lockbox, online, interactive voice response and web-based payments through personalized websites, among others. 
We have been the main provider of EBT services to the Puerto Rican government since 1998. Our EBT application allows certain agencies to deliver government benefits to participants through a magnetic card system and serves over 850,000 active participants in Puerto Rico. 
Business Solutions
We provide our financial institutions, corporate and government customers with a wide suite of business process management solutions including core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT consulting, business process outsourcing, item and cash processing, and fulfillment. In addition, we believe we are the only non-bank provider of cash processing services to the U.S. Federal Reserve in the Caribbean. 
Competition
Competitive factors impacting the success of our services include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services, and price. We believe that we compete well in each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our relationship with Popular, scale and expertise, and financial institution industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings and helps us compete with large global competitors with similar assets to ours. 
In merchant acquiring, we compete with several other service providers and financial institutions that are either in our markets or represented through Independent Sales Organizations (“ISO”), including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments, Inc., Elavon, Inc., EVO Payments, Inc., Paypal, Square, Zelle and some local banks. Also, the card associations and payment networks are increasingly offering products and services that compete with ours. The main competitive factors are price, reliability of service, brand awareness, strength of the relationship with financial institutions, system functionality, integration service capabilities and innovation. Our business is also impacted by the expansion of new payments methods and devices, card association business model expansion, and bank consolidation. 
In payment services, we compete with several other third-party card processors, debit networks, and financial technology providers, including Tecnocom Telecomunicaciones y Energía, S.A., Galileo Financial Technologies, LLC, Marqeta, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Total System Services, Inc., MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, Global Payments, Inc. Rappi, PayU and Paypal. Also, card associations and payment networks are increasingly offering products and services that compete with our products and services. The main competitive factors are price, system performance and reliability, system functionality, security, service capabilities and disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities. 
In business solutions, our main competition includes internal technology departments within financial institutions, retailers, data processing or software development departments of large companies, large technology and consulting companies, and/or financial technology providers, such as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., CGI Inc. and Fiserv, Inc. The main competitive factors are price, system performance and reliability, system functionality, security, service capabilities, and disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous registrations for several trademarks in different jurisdictions and own or have licenses to use certain software and technology, which are critical to our business and future success. For example, we own the ATH and EVERTEC trademarks in several jurisdictions, which are associated by the public, financial institutions and merchants with high quality and reliable electronic commerce, payments, and debit network solutions and services. Such goodwill allows us to be competitive, retain our customers and expand our business. Further, we also use a combination of (i) proprietary software, and (ii) duly licensed third-party software to operate our business and deliver secure and reliable products and services to our customers. The licensed software is subject to terms and conditions that we considered within the industry standards. Most are perpetual licenses and the rest are term licenses with renewable terms. In addition, we monitor these license agreements and maintain close contact with our suppliers to ensure their continuity of service. 
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by securing appropriate statutory intellectual property protection in the relevant jurisdictions. We also protect proprietary know-how and trade secrets through company confidentiality policies, licenses, programs, and contractual agreements.
People and Culture
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,500 employees, 53% of which are Puerto Rico and US employees, while our remaining workforce is composed of foreign nationals working in our offices throughout Latin America, which include, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. In Brazil, we have two unionized employees covered by the terms of industry-specific collective agreements. None of our other employees are otherwise represented by any labor organization. We believe we have strong and positive relationships with our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages in connection with employee matters.
Diversity and Inclusion
Our culture is underpinned by our core values, including a commitment to diversity and inclusion, an essential component of our formula for innovation. We value diversity of ideas, thoughts, and opinions, as well as of race, gender, age, cultural backgrounds, and physical abilities, among others. We embrace inclusion by integrating diversity into our human capital management, product development and customer service strategies and decisions. Our workforce is 37% female and 63% male, making us unique among technology companies both in the U.S. and in Latin America. Over 99% of our employees and over 90% of our managers are Hispanic. 
In 2021, the Company implemented the Next Generation Talent Program which identifies emerging leaders in the organization and provides them with training and development focused on becoming the successors for senior management. The program has a 50/50 male and female participation.
The Company has been included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index ("GEI") for four consecutive years. The GEI distinguishes companies committed to transparency in gender reporting and advancing women’s equality. 
Employee Engagement
Evertec considers employee engagement a key component of its high-performance culture. Throughout the year, we engage with our employees in many ways, including through content on Evertec’s intranet, digital signage, virtual quarterly town-hall style (all-staff) meetings, and in many other ways. 
An internal engagement survey is conducted at least once every two years. Our last comprehensive engagement survey was performed in 2020, with 85% of employees participating, the highest participation rate in the Company's history. The survey empowers employees to provide feedback on a variety of experiences, the results help Evertec's management and leadership gain insight into the most important drivers related to the work environment of our employees. Areas with highest employee satisfaction were our business and organizational development, collaboration, and work environment. In response to this employee feedback, management collaborates with our employees to create and adopt action plans to address concerns or potential areas of improvement. Completion of these action plans are monitored by the People & Culture division and reported to senior management.
Recruiting and Development Initiatives
Evertec pursues a diverse talent pool and is an Equal Opportunity Employer that aims to hire the best-qualified candidates for available positions. We promote based on merit. Our diversity recruitment initiatives are tracked through the completion of an Annual Affirmative Action Plan. In addition, we periodically conduct gender gap pay analysis for our employee population. The Company currently has a remote recruitment and on-boarding strategy to ensure the safety of our new hires and existing population in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Evertec is focused on providing our employees the tools needed for their career development. Evertec University, in one platform, features all the learning opportunities available to our workforce, providing a curriculum composed of both online classroom and external trainings. Within Evertec University, we developed a leadership program that includes a 360-degree assessment, feed forward sessions, a leadership on-boarding program and a leadership academy. In 2021, the Company began providing access to the Linkedin learning platform which provides an extensive and diverse training catalog ranging from technical to soft-skill and leadership courses that allow our employees to develop in a self-paced and flexible environment. We also provide health and safety educational sessions in liaison with external health professionals as part of our health and wellness education programs efforts. 
Our values for People and Culture are aligned with our commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG). For further information, refer to the ESG tear sheet available on our website at https://ir.evertecinc.com/ESG.doc as well as Vision, Mission and Values section in our most recent proxy statement. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules 
Federal Reserve Regulations 
Popular is a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. To the extent that we are deemed to be a “subsidiary” of Popular for purposes of the Bank Holding Company (“BHC”) Act, we will be subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and our activities will be subject to several related significant restrictions, the more significant of which are discussed below. 
Transactions with Affiliates 
To the extent that we are deemed to be an affiliate of Popular for purpose of the affiliate transaction rules found in Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board, we will be subject to various restrictions on our ability to borrow from and engage in certain other transactions with Popular’s bank subsidiaries, Banco Popular and Banco Popular North America (“BPNA”). In general, these rules require that any “covered transaction” that we enter into with Banco Popular or BPNA (or any of their respective operating subsidiaries), as the case may be, must be limited to 10% of Banco Popular’s or BPNA’s, as the case may be, capital stock and surplus. In addition, all “covered transactions” between Banco Popular or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates on the other hand, must be limited to 20% of Banco Popular’s or BPNA’s, as the case may be, capital stock and surplus. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute and by regulation to include a loan or extension of credit from a bank to an affiliate, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, or the credit risk arising from certain repurchase, securities borrowing/lending and derivative transactions that a bank may engage in with an affiliate. Certain credit transactions by a bank with an affiliate, in addition to being subject to the limitations above, must be secured by specified collateral. 
In addition, Section 23B and Regulation W require that to the extent that we are deemed an affiliate of Banco Popular or BPNA, all transactions between us and either Banco Popular or BPNA be on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to Banco Popular or BPNA, as the case may be, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered by Banco Popular or BPNA to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. 
Permissible Activities 
To the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular for bank regulatory purposes, we may conduct only those activities that are authorized for a bank holding company or a financial holding company under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K and other relevant U.S. federal banking laws. These activities generally include activities that are related to banking, or that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. In addition, restrictions placed on Popular as a result of supervisory or enforcement actions may restrict us or our activities in certain circumstances, even if these actions are unrelated to our conduct or business. 
To the extent that we are deemed to be a foreign subsidiary of a bank holding company under the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, we will rely on the authority granted under the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K to conduct our data processing, management consulting and related activities outside the United States. The Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K generally limits activities of a bank holding company outside the United States that are not those activities of a banking or financial nature, that are specifically permitted under Regulation K to foreign subsidiaries or necessary to carry on such activities that are not otherwise permissible for a foreign subsidiary under the banking regulations. We continue to engage in certain activities outside the scope of such permissible activities pursuant to authority under the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K, which allows a bank holding company to retain, in the context of an acquisition of a going concern, such otherwise impermissible activities if they account for not more than 5% of either the consolidated assets or consolidated revenues of the acquired organization.
New lines of business, other new activities, divestitures, or acquisitions that we may wish to commence in the future may not be permissible for us under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K or other applicable U.S. federal banking laws. Further, as a result of being subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, we may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before engaging in certain new activities or businesses, whether organically or by acquisition, unless such activities are considered financial in nature. If we are unable to obtain any such approval on a timely basis, are delayed in receiving approval, are approved subject to regulatory conditions or do not receive approval, this may make transactions more expensive or may make us less attractive to potential sellers.
Examinations 
As a technology service provider to financial institutions, we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the “FFIEC”), an interagency body of federal financial regulators that includes the Federal Reserve Board. The office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico also participates in such examinations by the FFIEC. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients’ auditors and regulators. 
Regulatory Reform and Other Legislative Initiatives 
The payment card industry has come under increased scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) set forth significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry, including the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has broad supervisory, enforcement and rulemaking authority over consumer financial products and services (including many offered by us and by our clients) and certain bank and non-bank providers of such products and services. In addition, Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act (commonly referred to as the “Durbin Amendment”) imposed new restrictions on card networks and debit card issuers. More specifically, the Durbin Amendment provides that the interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment network may receive or charge for an electronic debit transaction must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing, and settling the transaction. 
The Federal Reserve’s regulations (a) limit debit transaction interchange fees to $.21 + (5 bps times the value of the transactions) + $.01 (as a fraud adjustment for issuers that have in place policies and measures to address fraud); (b) require that issuers enable at least two unaffiliated payment card networks on their debit cards without regard to authentication method; and (c) prohibit card issuers and payment card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements for debit card processing and restrict card issuers and payment networks from inhibiting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over networks of their choice. The Dodd-Frank Act also allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (currently, not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card and provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with various payment methods, such as cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers.
The CFPB is responsible for many of the regulatory functions with respect to consumer financial products and services. In addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws, the CFPB is authorized to issue rules prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of a consumer financial product or service or any transaction with a consumer for such product or service. The CFPB also has authority to examine supervised entities for compliance with, and to enforce violations of, consumer financial protection laws. 
To the extent that we are deemed an affiliate of Banco Popular, an insured depository institution with greater than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and as a service provider to other insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as larger participants in markets for consumer financial products and services, as determined by the CFPB, we are subject to the supervision, enforcement, and rulemaking authority of the CFPB. CFPB rules, examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs. 
From time to time, various legislative initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, and changes in regulations or agency policies, or in the interpretation of such regulations and policies, are proposed by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to modify the powers of bank holding companies and their affiliates. Such legislation or changes in regulation could affect our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If adopted, such legislation or changes in regulation could increase the cost of doing business or limit permissible activities. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations or related policies and guidance, would have on our financial condition or results of operations.
Other Government Regulations 
Our services are also subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, Puerto Rico, and foreign regulation, including privacy laws, international trade regulations, the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws, anti-trust and competition laws, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the PR Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other Puerto Rico laws and regulations. Failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide such services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties. The principal areas of regulation (in addition to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board) that impact our business are described below. 
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
We and our financial institution clients are required to comply with various U.S. state, federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including those imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and to companies that provide services to financial institutions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of certain personal information, require disclosure to individuals of detailed privacy practices and provide them with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as, in certain circumstances, obligations to provide notification to affected individuals, states officers and consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data, of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information. In addition, U.S. state and federal government agencies have been contemplating or developing new initiatives to safeguard privacy and enhance data and information security. Some foreign privacy laws may be stricter than those applicable under U.S. federal, state, or Puerto Rican law. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with applicable privacy and cybersecurity regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as applied to the financial institutions themselves. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business." 
Anti-Money Laundering and Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
Since we provide data processing services to both foreign and domestic financial institutions, we are required to comply with certain anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and economic sanctions imposed on designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. Specifically, we must adhere to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the “BSA”) regarding processing and facilitation of financial transactions, as well as other state, local and foreign laws relating to money laundering. Furthermore, as a data processing company that provides services to foreign parties and facilitates financial transactions between foreign parties, we are obligated to screen transactions for compliance with the sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). These regulations prohibit us from entering into or facilitating a transaction to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals and others, such as narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations designated by the U.S. Government under one or more sanctions regimes. 
A major focus of governmental policy in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Preventing and detecting money laundering and other related suspicious activities at their earliest stages warrants careful monitoring. The BSA, along with a number of other anti-money laundering laws, imposes various reporting and record-keeping requirements concerning currency and other types of monetary instruments. Similar anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. These laws and regulations impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for us. We may also be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. 
Federal Trade Commission Act and Other Laws Impacting our Customers' Business
All persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (“UDAP”). In addition, there are other laws, rules and/or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant's payment processor, to investigations, fees, fines, and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. Federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the states' attorneys general have authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules, and regulations. To the extent we process payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws, rules, and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. 
Anti-trust and Competition Laws
We are required to comply with various federal, local, and foreign competition and anti-trust laws, including the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, Robinson-Patman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act and Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act. In general, competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anti-competitive behavior. Competition and anti-trust law investigations can be lengthy, and violations are subject to civil and/or criminal fines and other sanctions for both corporations and individuals that participate in the prohibited conduct. Class action civil anti-trust lawsuits can result in significant judgments, including in some cases, payment of treble damages and/or attorneys' fees to the successful plaintiff. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Failure to comply with existing and future rules and regulations in the jurisdiction in which we operate could adversely affect the operations of one or more of our businesses in those jurisdictions.”
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), Export Administration and Other 
As a data processing company that services both foreign and domestic clients, our business activities in foreign countries, and in particular our transactions with foreign governmental entities, subject us to the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, as well as the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdiction where we operate. Pursuant to applicable anti-bribery laws, our transactions with foreign government officials and political candidates are subject to certain limitations. Finally, in the course of business with foreign clients and subsidiaries, we export certain software and hardware that is regulated by the Export Administration Regulations from the United States to the foreign parties. Together, these regulations place restrictions on who we can transact with, what transactions may be facilitated, how we may operate in foreign jurisdictions and what we may export to foreign countries.
The preceding list of laws and regulations is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. The enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect directly and indirectly the operation of our business, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, loss of revenue, decreased profitability and/or adverse publicity.
 Association and Network Rules 
Several of our subsidiaries are registered with or certified by card associations and payment networks, including the ATH network, MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover and numerous debit and EBT networks as members or as service providers for member institutions in connection with the services we provide to our customers. As such, we are subject to applicable card association and network rules, which could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts and/or omissions by us, our acquirer customers, processing customers and/or merchants. For example, “EMV” is a credit and debit card authentication methodology that the card associations are mandating to processors, issuers, and acquirers in the payment industry. Compliance deadlines for EMV mandates vary by country and by payment network. We have invested significant resources and man-hours to develop and implement this methodology in all our payment related platforms. However, we are not certain if or when our financial institution customers will use or accept the methodology and the time it will take for this technology to be rolled-out to all customer ATM and POS devices connected to our platforms or adopted by our card issuing clients. Non-compliance with EMV mandates could result in lost business or financial losses from fraud or fines from network operators. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association relating to payment transactions processed by us using the Automated Clearing House Network and to various government laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to EBT.
Geographic Concentration 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, 80% of revenues were generated from our business in Puerto Rico, while the remaining 20% was generated from Latin America and the Caribbean. Latin America includes, among others, Costa Rica, México, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Panamá. The Caribbean primarily represents the Dominican Republic and the Virgin Islands. See Note 24 to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to geographic areas. 
Seasonality 
Our payment businesses generally experience increased activity during the traditional holiday shopping periods and around other nationally recognized holidays.
