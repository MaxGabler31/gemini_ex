We rigorously track and measure the progress and results of our initiatives. We are focused on long-term planning and goal-setting strategies as well as our near-term operating results. We believe our strategic initiatives help drive our revenue growth, increase our market share and increase our margins.
 Where appropriate, we also seek to grow our business with targeted acquisitions that enable us to achieve our strategic goals. For example, in October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Fabri-Kal, a manufacturer of thermoformed plastic packaging products whose products include portion cups, lids, clamshells, drink cups and yogurt containers for the consumer-packaged goods and institutional foodservice markets. The acquisition includes four manufacturing facilities in the United States. For additional details, refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the consolidated financial statements.
 Over the last several years, our business has evolved to focus on our core, business-to-business North American foodservice, food merchandising and beverage merchandising operations. To this end, both before and after our IPO in September 2020, we have divested certain of our non-core businesses, and may do so in the future. For example, in October 2021, we agreed to sell our interest in Naturepak Beverage Packaging Co. Ltd., our 50% joint venture with Naturepak Limited, which is a leading provider of fresh liquid carton and packaging systems in the Middle East and North Africa region, and in January 2022, we agreed to sell our carton packaging and filling machinery businesses in China, Korea and Taiwan. For information on divestitures undertaken before our IPO, please refer to the “Corporate Information” section below. For details on divestitures and distributions of certain operations that impacted our results, refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, and Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the consolidated financial statements.
 Customers
 We supply our products to a broad and diversified mix of companies, including FSRs, QSRs, foodservice distributors, supermarkets, grocery and healthy eating retailers, other food stores, food and beverage producers, food packers and food processors. Our customers range from large blue-chip multinational companies to national and regional companies to small local businesses. We have developed strong and longstanding relationships with our customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in 2021. Our ten largest customers accounted for 38% of net revenues in 2021.
Seasonality
 Our business does not experience high seasonality due to the complementary nature of the seasonal effects on our segments, though portions of our business are moderately seasonal. Our Foodservice and Food Merchandising operations peak during the summer and fall months in North America when the favorable weather and harvest and holiday seasons lead to increased consumption, resulting in greater levels of sales in the second and third quarters. Beverage Merchandising’s customers are principally engaged in providing products that are generally less sensitive to seasonal effects, although Beverage Merchandising does experience some seasonality as a result of increased consumption of milk by school children during the North American academic year, resulting in a greater level of carton product sales in the first and fourth quarters. The negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on our business during 2020 and 2021 outweighed the impacts of seasonality during those years. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability – COVID-19 within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further details.
 Competition
 The markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, sustainability and price. While we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and we may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all, as pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship. Our competitors include, among others, Dart Container Corporation, Huhtamäki Oyj, Berry Global Group, Inc., Genpak, Sonoco, Paper Excellence Group, Stora Enso Oyj, Tekni-Plex, Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings, SIG Combibloc and Elopak.
Distribution and Marketing
 We have a large, well-invested manufacturing base and a hub-and-spoke distribution network in the United States and in the international geographies in which we operate. Most of our assets are in the United States, which allows us to provide an extensive offering of U.S.-manufactured products to our customers. We believe our manufacturing footprint and distribution network provides us a competitive advantage in each of our segments. Foodservice is the only manufacturer among its competitors in the United States with an extensive nationwide hub-and-spoke distribution network, enabling customers to buy across our entire product offering. Food Merchandising is a low cost U.S. manufacturer with well-invested facilities within close proximity to our customer base. We have an unrivalled product offering in the North American foodservice and food merchandising markets and a “one-face-to-the-customer” service model. This service model uses one sales representative per account to produce one order with multiple SKUs supported by one customer service representative that is responsible for one shipment with one invoice. We believe Beverage Merchandising is uniquely positioned in the United States as the only producer that manufactures fresh beverage cartons, filling machinery and liquid packaging board, which we believe positions us as a low cost solution with excellent customer service.

We have made manufacturing flexibility a priority in our investment of capital. We are able to offer substrates and product lines to match changing market needs efficiently and at low cost. This enables us to scale production in response to the requirements of our customers and trends in the market, including for example, increasing our use of recycled and recyclable material to produce a greater number of sustainable products and earn higher margins from the sale of these products. We have strategically invested in flexible manufacturing assets that can be quickly converted to produce alternative products. Our broad manufacturing base includes approximately 1,100 production lines, and we manufacture approximately 129 billion units each year.
 As of December 31, 2021, Foodservice has 22 manufacturing plants, and Food Merchandising has 24 manufacturing plants. Foodservice and Food Merchandising share the use of 32 warehouses and 8 regional mixing centers. Beverage Merchandising has 6 U.S. beverage carton manufacturing plants, 7 international beverage carton manufacturing plants (including 3 plants in our joint ventures), 2 filling machinery plants, 3 extrusion plants, 2 integrated liquid packaging board and paper mills and 3 chip mills. Each of our manufacturing plants is managed by a manufacturing director, and we use lean operating practices and information systems to measure performance against objective metrics to optimize manufacturing efficiency and reduce cost.
 Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins, fiber (principally raw wood, wood chips and recycled newsprint), paperboard (principally cartonboard and cupstock) and aluminum. We also use commodity chemicals, steel and energy, including fuel oil, electricity, natural gas and coal, to manufacture our products. We purchase most of our raw materials based on negotiated rates with suppliers, which are tied to published indices. Typically, we do not enter into long-term purchase contracts that provide for fixed quantities or prices for our principal raw materials. Most of our raw materials and other input costs are purchased on the spot market. 
 Resin prices have historically fluctuated based on changes in supply and demand and influenced by the prices of crude oil and monomers, which may be impacted by extreme weather conditions and the demand for other end-uses. The prices of raw wood and wood chips may fluctuate due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, commodity market fluctuations and changes in governmental policies and regulations. Tariffs, trade sanctions and other disruptions in international commerce can also affect the cost of our raw materials. 
 We mitigate the impact of increased commodity costs principally through higher product pricing, manufacturing and overhead cost control, and hedging arrangements. Many of the customer pricing agreements that our segments enter into contain raw material cost pass-through mechanisms that adjust prices to reflect the impact of changes in raw material costs. Generally, the contractual price adjustments do not occur simultaneously with commodity price fluctuations, but rather on a mutually agreed upon schedule, which often causes a lead-lag effect, during which margins are negatively impacted in the short term when raw material costs increase and positively impacted in the short term when raw material costs decrease. Historically, the average lag time in implementing raw material cost pass-through mechanisms has been between three and four months. We also use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials, but we do not fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.
 At this time, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.
 For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to Financial Outlook – Raw Materials and Energy Prices within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Intellectual Property and Research and Development
 We have a proven history of product innovation, including the introduction of new products and the addition of innovative features to existing products. Innovation is a core capability we are proud of and a key focus area going forward as we strive to enhance our product portfolio, drive growth and increase margins. 
 We have significant intellectual property and proprietary know-how. We hold over 400 patents related to product design, utility and material formulations. 
 Our primary focus areas for product innovation are the development of packaging with useful new features, engineering new materials that improve the performance of our products and commercializing new environmentally-friendly packaging. Both consumer preferences and customer requirements continually evolve, and we strive to develop useful new features and products to meet those needs. Through our longstanding customer relationships, we gain valuable insight into our customers’ needs and are able to identify, engineer and develop optimal products for them. Functionality, quality, material savings, brand marketing, sustainability and safety are key drivers in our product development. Examples of our product innovations include reclosable beverage cartons, strawless lids, compostable cutlery and recycled polyethylene terephthalate “PET” containers.
 In Foodservice, our product innovation initiatives are focused on developing new products made from sustainable materials. In Food Merchandising, our product innovation is focused on rapidly growing emerging companies for whom packaging helps deliver their brand. In Beverage Merchandising, we have developed a variety of carton designs to help beverage manufacturers differentiate their 
 4


products and generate stronger brand recognition. Our barrier board technology allows our customers to achieve longer shelf life for their products while protecting against the loss of vitamins and other nutrients. 
 In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we spent a total of $22 million, $20 million and $22 million, respectively, on research and development efforts. We have dedicated technology and innovation facilities, and we employ personnel focused on product development, material innovation and process improvement. Our material science expertise and state-of-the-art product design and testing capabilities enable us to engineer high-performing materials and create new and innovative products to meet the requirements of our customers and the preferences of consumers as well as to increase food safety. We use our material science expertise to focus on sustainability, performance and material savings. We have industry-leading innovation centers where, among other things, we develop innovative resin blending and compounding formulations and processes and new engineered materials using paper/fiber substrates, which have on-site design, testing, prototyping and production capabilities. These unique material and product design capabilities allow us to partner with our customers to rapidly develop and commercialize new and innovative solutions that further increase the value we provide our customers. 
 Regulation
 Our business is subject to regulations governing products that may contact food in all the countries in which we have operations. Future regulatory and legislative changes can affect the economics of our business activities, lead to changes in operating practices, affect our customers and influence the demand for and the cost of providing products and services to our customers. We have implemented compliance programs and procedures designed to achieve compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and believe these programs and procedures are generally effective. Our production facilities are independently audited for adherence to good manufacturing practices. As of December 31, 2021, all North American Beverage Merchandising facilities have received Safe Quality Food certification, and 27 Foodservice and Food Merchandising facilities have achieved British Retail Consortium certification for meeting globally-recognized standards related to food safety and quality. Additionally, our paper mills and the recently-acquired Fabri-Kal facilities are FSSC 22000-certified, another relevant scheme related to food safety management.
 We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. Among other things, these requirements regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our employees, regulate the materials used in and the recycling of our products and impose liability, which can be strict, joint and several, for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances related to our current and former sites, as well as at third party sites where we or our predecessors have sent hazardous waste for disposal. Many of our manufacturing facilities require environmental permits, such as those limiting air and water emissions. Compliance with these permits can require capital investment and, in some cases, could limit production.
 In addition, a number of governmental authorities, both in the United States and abroad, have considered, and are expected to consider, legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste. Legislation of this type has included banning certain types of products, mandating certain rates of recycling or the use of recycled materials, imposing fees or taxes on packaging material and requiring retailers or manufacturers to take back packaging used for their products, which could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.
 Moreover, as environmental issues, such as climate change, have become more prevalent, governments have responded, and are expected to continue to respond, with increased legislation and regulation, which could negatively affect us. For example, the United States Congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates certain greenhouse gas emissions under existing laws such as the Clean Air Act. A number of states and local governments in the United States have also announced their intentions to implement their own programs to reduce greenhouse gases. These initiatives may cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental legislation or regulations, such as costs to upgrade or replace equipment, as well as increased indirect costs that could get passed through to us resulting from our suppliers and customers also incurring additional compliance costs.
 We have programs across our businesses to ensure we remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, refer to the risk factor “We are subject to a complex framework of laws and regulations, including, among others, those relating to product quality and environmental protection, and may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations” in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Environmental, Social and Governance
 Environmental
 Sustainable Products
 We offer products that deliver safe, fresh and convenient food and beverages. Our products help reduce food waste by protecting foods and beverages during transport, extending product shelf life and reducing the threat of contamination. Safety and convenience are more important than ever during a global pandemic that has imposed limits on dining and shopping options and increased the need for products that make take-out meals possible and guard against contamination. 
 We continue to grow our offering of sustainable products with new, plant-based bio-resin and fiber-based offerings. Today, we provide customers sustainable alternatives across nearly all our products and categories. We offer products made from seven different types of sustainable substrates and nearly all are made in North America. We believe our EarthChoice brand is the largest brand of sustainable foodservice packaging in North America, with each product meeting at least one of our “Four Rs” of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle or Renew. Our Greenware and Recycleware brands, which we acquired as a part of the Fabri-Kal acquisition, complement our sustainable offerings, being made with renewable and recycled content materials, respectively.
 Through our state-of-the-art production technology and material science expertise, we have the ability to develop new value-add and sustainable solutions. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from changing consumer preferences for more environmentally sustainable products. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 64% of our net revenue came from products made from recycled, recyclable or renewable materials, and we have set a goal of having 100% of our net revenue come from such products by 2030.
 In addition, many of our customers have publicly-stated goals to increase the use of sustainable products. A significant portion of our new product and material innovations is geared toward developing sustainable products for our customers, with over 100 new items launched since 2019. As customers look to switch to more sustainable alternatives, we are well-positioned to quickly and effectively support them, thanks to our innovative teams of materials scientists and engineers. With a high percentage of our net revenue coming from products that are made from recyclable or other sustainable materials, we are helping our customers achieve their own sustainability goals. 
 In addition to using recyclable and compostable materials, we support efforts to expand opportunities for consumers to recycle or compost our products, notably as one of the founding members of the Carton Council, Paper Recovery Alliance, Plastics Recovery Group, Foam Recycling Coalition and the Paper Cup Alliance. We have demonstrated our commitment to use more recycled plastic by joining the Association for Plastic Recyclers’ Demand Champions program. We engage with the composting industry through the U.S. Composting Council, and a growing number of our products are certified compostable by the Biodegradable Products Institute. We are a longstanding member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, an industry working group aligned with our purpose: Packaging A Better Future. 
 Sustainable Operations
 Our dedication to the environment goes beyond just the products we manufacture. Within our operations, we are working to limit our impact by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, minimizing water use and decreasing waste going to landfills. In 2021, we began to implement a data management system that allows for auditable data collection and reporting on sustainability metrics. We also initiated greenhouse gas analysis for our paper mills, our largest source of emissions, to identify opportunities for improvement. The results of these analyses will inform our future goal-setting. We continue to track our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2021, we calculated our Scope 3 emissions for the first time. Our data show that our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased three percent between 2015 and 2020. 
 Improving energy efficiency is critical to us as energy expenses are among our highest cost categories to manufacture our products. We are also looking to use more renewable energy, which further reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. Today, about half of our annual energy consumption comes from renewable sources including biomass, hydropower, wind and solar.
 Efforts to minimize our water usage take various forms, given the variety of operations we run. We primarily use water for process operations, cooling and cleaning. The majority of our water use occurs at our two paper mills. Most of our water use is “non-consumptive use,” which means the water is treated and returned back to the environment after being used in our operations. In 2021, we also undertook a water stress analysis for all of our locations to support prioritization of performance improvement measures, which showed that 97% of our water use is in areas with low water stress.
 Reducing waste in our operations is an ongoing, company-wide pursuit. We reuse a significant majority of plastic and paper scrap to manufacture our own products and implement programs to reduce scrap in production as much as possible. The plastic or paper scrap that cannot be reused in the manufacturing process is recycled by third parties where possible.
 Protecting the sustainability of our forests is a critical initiative, given our broad use of paper through our product offerings. The paper and paperboard purchased from our U.S. paper suppliers are certified to meet internationally-recognized fiber sourcing standards. 
 6


Additionally, our North American paper production facilities have chain-of-custody certifications from independent, third-party certifiers. In 2021, 32% of the fiber we procured came from these certified sources, up from 30% in 2020.
 Social and Human Capital Resources
 Our most valuable asset is our people, and our human capital management is evolving to meet the changing needs of today’s workforce.
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 16,200 people globally. We believe in supporting and empowering our employees through recognition, health and welfare benefits offerings, development opportunities and fair compensation. Employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent 31% of our employees. Our operations are subject to various local, national and multinational laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements, and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.
Workforce Health and Safety
 Safety is a core value and affects everything we do. Our manufacturing facilities have achieved safety metrics that are approximately 2.5 times better than the industry average in 2021. We had a total recordable incidence rate of 1.15 compared to the industry average of 3.10, a total lost time restricted time rate of 0.75 compared to the industry average of 2.00 and a total lost workday rate of 0.34 compared to an industry average of 0.90.
Corporate Culture
 Our purpose, mission and values represent the principles we honor, the promises we keep and the foundational beliefs we share. They communicate what our customers and shareholders can expect from us and what we can expect of each other. As we grow our brand, we are also mindful of the need to continue building on this values-based leadership. In 2021, we prioritized building corporate culture around our purpose of Packaging A Better Future and our values to Celebrate People, Do What’s Right, Win Together, Demand Excellence and Own It, including the creation of a Talent & Culture team. We also launched the Pactiv Evergreen Give Back program, an annual initiative to reward employees and their families for living our values by supporting the communities where we live and work.
Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Development
 We focus on attracting and retaining a diverse workforce, and we are committed to being transparent when it comes to diversity. In 2021, we released metrics related to the ethnic background and diversity in leadership of our U.S.-based employees, which represented approximately 85% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2021. Also as of December 31, 2021, nearly 50% of our U.S.-based employees were Black, Indigenous or People of Color, including 19% of those in our senior or mid-level leadership positions. In addition, 28% of our employees are women, including 21% of those in our senior or mid-level leadership positions.
 We believe strongly in developing our future leaders and provide opportunities through our Operations Leadership Development Program and our Leadership Advisory Council, or LAC. Our Operations Leadership Development Program recruits Junior Military Officers and provides them with an intensive training program to fast-track their transition into manufacturing and logistics leadership roles. Fifty-one candidates have successfully completed or are currently enrolled in this program and nine are currently Plant Managers. Our LAC identifies high-performing and high-potential employees. We also aim to provide these employees with the executive mentorship and guidance needed for them to excel, and we provide them with leadership and strategy development training. Forty percent of employees who graduated from the LAC since 2015 are now in senior leadership positions. Sixty-three percent of these new leaders are women, while 38% are Black or African-American, or Hispanic.
 Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. Looking beyond our own employees, in 2021, we updated our procurement procedures to require vendors to certify whether they are diverse and conducted an analysis to better understand the diversity of our existing vendors.
 Governance
 We have implemented a strong, independent governance program. The composition of our Board of Directors reflects our commitment to independence. Of the six members of the board, four are independent members, including two women, one of whom is Hispanic. The chairman of our Board of Directors is also an independent member. In an effort to expand and strengthen corporate governance, in 2021 our Board of Directors confirmed that environmental, social and governance, or ESG, and corporate sustainability are subject to their direct oversight. We also began disclosing our greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption according to Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards, and publicly reported to CDP (Formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) on climate and water security. We also revised our procurement processes, supporting improved tracking of compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
 Policies and ongoing reporting on ESG initiatives and performance can be found on our investor relations website at https://investors.pactivevergreen.com/esg-documents and will be provided, free of charge, to any shareholder who requests a copy.
