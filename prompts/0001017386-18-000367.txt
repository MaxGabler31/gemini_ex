ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
 
MicroChannel Technologies Corporation (the “Company”) was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Energy Technologies, Inc. (“New Energy”). New Energy spun off its issued and outstanding shares to New Energy’s shareholders on December 18, 2007. We were incorporated under the name MultiChannel Technologies Corporation on February 28, 2005 in the State of Nevada, and changed to our existing name, on April 4, 2005.
 
On or about June 27, 2018 we changed domiciles from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware and thereafter reorganized under the Delaware Holding Company Statute Delaware General Corporation Law Section 251(g). On or about July 12, 2018, two subsidiaries were formed for the purpose of effecting the reorganization. We incorporated MCTC Holdings, Inc. and MCTC Holdings Inc. incorporated MicroChannel Corp.. We then effected a merger involving the three constituents and under the terms of the merger we were merged into MicroChannel Corp., with MicroChannel Corp. surviving and our separate corporate existence ceasing. Following the merger MCTC Holdings, Inc. became the surviving publicly traded issuer and all of our assets and liabilities were merged into MCTC Holdings, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiary MicroChannel Corp.. Our shareholders became the shareholders of MCTC Holdings, Inc. on a one for one basis. 
 
We are not currently engaged in any business operations. We are, however, in the process of attempting to identify, locate, and if warranted, acquire new commercial opportunities.
