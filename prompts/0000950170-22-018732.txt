ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 Nutanix, Inc. ("we," "us," "our" or "Nutanix") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform, which we call the Nutanix Cloud Platform, that consists of software solutions and cloud services that power our customers’ enterprise infrastructure. Our solutions deliver a consistent cloud operating model across edge, private-, hybrid- and multicloud environments for all applications and their data. Our solutions allow organizations to simply move their workloads, including enterprise applications, high-performance databases, end-user computing and virtual desktop infrastructure ("VDI") services, container-based modern applications, and analytics applications, between on-premises and public clouds. Our goal is to provide a single, simple, open software platform for all hybrid and multicloud applications and their data.
 Founded in 2009, we pioneered the hyperconverged infrastructure ("HCI") category, initially combining the disparate IT silos of compute, storage and networking into a single on-premises product which offered simplicity, lower total cost of ownership, scalability and customer choice. We continued to innovate and developed Acropolis Hypervisor ("AHV") - our native hypervisor designed to run all virtualized applications. To give our customers even more choice, we engineered our software solutions to run on a variety of server platforms, decoupling our software from our Nutanix-branded hardware appliances and powering a variety of on-premises private cloud deployments; a significant step in our transition from a hardware to a software company. That transition has continued with the adoption of "cloud" as a mainstream IT paradigm, which has motivated IT professionals to move toward hybrid cloud architectures that allow businesses to simultaneously utilize a private cloud powered by Nutanix software, along with third-party public cloud infrastructures for maximum flexibility. We continue to transform our software solutions into a comprehensive enterprise cloud platform, based on web-scale engineering principles and with a focus on automation and operational simplicity, which allows our customers to power nearly any scale IT deployment. Although today our customers primarily use our enterprise cloud platform to power their on-premises private cloud deployments, our solutions also simplify the complexities of multicloud environments with a single management console for automation, cost governance and compliance. The end result will be an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify operations, infrastructure and data services from the edge, to private cloud and public clouds, allowing IT to choose the right cloud for each application.
 To provide our customers with the freedom to choose the best consumption model based on their specific business needs, we have also continued to reshape our licensing by moving toward a subscription-based business model. A subscription-based business model means one in which our products, including associated support and entitlement arrangements, are sold with a defined term. For more information, see the section titled "Components of Our Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7, as well as Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, as part of our transition to a subscription-based business model, we have transitioned to a sales compensation structure that is based on Annual Contract Value ("ACV"). These transitions have caused, and will continue to cause, our traditional life-of-device licensing models to become increasingly replaced by term-based licenses, portable across hybrid- and multicloud deployments. We believe that these transitions – from hardware to software solutions, and from life-of-device to subscription models – will contribute to our long-term growth. In fiscal 2022, our subscription billings increased to 92% of total billings, up 3 percentage points from fiscal 2021, and our subscription revenue reached $1.4 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 15%. In fiscal 2022, ACV billings was $756.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 27%.
 

The Nutanix Cloud Platform
 Leveraging the foundation of our core HCI technology, the Nutanix Cloud Platform delivers a rich set of products, solutions and services to enable our customers to simply manage their private cloud and, increasingly, their public and hybrid multicloud environments. All of our offerings are supported by a unified control plane, unified Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs"), security, and lifecycle management. The Nutanix Cloud Platform is available in private cloud deployment, and is increasingly available on public cloud, through managed service providers and telcos, and in the future, as-a-Service.
 In 2022, we updated our pricing and packaging to simplify our product portfolio and streamline the products and offerings that we have developed over the years. The description of our products and offerings below are based on our new simplified product portfolio, but will also refer, in parentheses, to the product names that we have used in the past.
 Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure (NCI) – Our offerings in hybrid cloud infrastructure combine our core HCI software stack (AOS) and our native, enterprise-grade hypervisor (AHV), and also add in support for virtual networking, disaster recovery, network and data security and Kubernetes container runtime.
 AOS. AOS converges virtualization, storage, and networking services into a turnkey solution. AOS supports major hypervisors, including our native AHV and VMware ESXi and uses software running across a scale-out cluster of servers to deliver advanced storage capabilities to all workloads running on the compute cluster. Building on a distributed data fabric, AOS enables robust enterprise storage services across multiple storage protocols. Storage capabilities include snapshots and cloning, performance acceleration capabilities, such as data locality and all flash optimizations, storage optimization, such as deduplication, compression and erasure coding, data protection and disaster recovery features, and data security with software based data encryption. Our disaster recovery solutions include long distance data replication between multiple sites, advanced failover orchestration capabilities and support for metro high availability configurations, zero loss synchronous replication and snapshot based disaster recovery over any distance.
 AHV. AHV is a native, enterprise-grade virtualization solution that is included with our enterprise cloud platform with no additional software components to license, install or manage. AHV is built upon a widely-used open source hypervisor technology, known as KVM and extends its base functionality to include additional features for storage performance and workload management such as virtual machine high availability and live migration. AHV also includes such features as flexible migrations, automated workload placement, security hardening, network virtualization, data protection and disaster recovery and rich analytics.
 Flow Virtual Networking and Flow Network Security. Flow provides services to visualize the network, automate common network operations, build virtual private networks, and integrate with various third-party networking and security products. We supplement the networking capabilities of AOS with application-centric firewall services based on advanced microsegmentation technology (Flow Network Security) that protect applications against internal and external threats.
 Nutanix Kubernetes Engine (previously known as Karbon). Our cloud infrastructure stack also provides for automated deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters to simplify the provisioning, operations and lifecycle management of cloud-native environments, containerized applications and microservices.
 

Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2). In addition, we provide full automation to deploy our cloud infrastructure stack in public cloud environments like Amazon Web Services ("AWS") bare-metal (currently generally available) and Microsoft Azure (currently in public preview and expected to become generally available in the future) as NC2. NC2 provides ultimate flexibility for customers as just another deployment model for their NCI licenses, allowing them to take advantage of the elasticity of public cloud resources while maintaining the same operating model they have been accustomed to on premises. Elastic disaster recovery, cloud bursting, site consolidation and cloud migration are typical NC2 use cases.
 Nutanix Cloud Management (NCM) – Our offerings in cloud management combine intelligent operations, self-service for infrastructure and applications, multicloud governance and security. Our offerings in cloud management include our control plane providing management and analytics across the Nutanix Cloud Platform, which delivers integrated management, capacity planning, robust operational analytics, automated remediation, self-service capabilities and one-click administration (previously known as Prism Pro/Ultimate). We also provide cloud governance (previously known as Nutanix Beam) as well as automation services that streamline application lifecycle management, provide self-service provisioning for infrastructure and applications, and deliver powerful multicloud orchestration (previously known as Nutanix Calm).
 Nutanix Unified Storage (NUS) – Our Unified Storage product offering includes scale-out storage services that consolidate management of structured and unstructured data. Nutanix customers can simplify storage operations, while delivering enterprise-grade NFS and SMB files services (Nutanix Files), as well as S3-compatible object services (Nutanix Objects), at nearly any scale. NUS can be enabled on a Nutanix HCI cluster next to virtualized workloads or can be deployed as a dedicated cluster, as a full replacement for traditional network files and object storage appliances. In addition to the scale and performance of NUS, we further differentiate NUS with the same focus on simplicity and user experience that Nutanix is known for, as well as with complementary data security governance offerings such as Nutanix Data Lens.
 Nutanix Database Service (NDB) – We also provide automated database management to simplify database administration and to efficiently manage database copies that proliferate in most IT environments (previously known as Nutanix Era). NDB supports a variety of databases, both proprietary and open source, and can run both in the private datacenter and in public clouds through Nutanix Cloud Clusters.
 Desktop-as-a-Service – Our Desktop-as-a-Service product offering provides a rich set of end-user computing ("EUC") services that can reduce the cost of delivering virtualized desktops and applications, while improving performance and scalability. Services include virtualization, file storage, security and networking for traditional VDI environments. We also provide desktop-as-a-service (Nutanix Frame) to deliver virtual apps or desktops to users from multiple public cloud environments and/or an enterprises private cloud data center, which can be easily accessed from any browser.
 Delivery of Our Solutions
 The Nutanix Cloud Platform can be deployed on-premises at the edge or in data centers, running on a variety of qualified hardware platforms, in popular public cloud environments such as AWS (currently generally available) and Microsoft Azure (currently in public preview and expected to become generally available in the future) through Nutanix Cloud Clusters, or, in the case of our cloud-based software and software-as-a-service ("SaaS") offerings, via hosted service. Non-portable software licenses for our platform are delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances, with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance. Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can also be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Our subscription term-based licenses typically have terms ranging from one to five years. Our cloud-based SaaS subscriptions have terms extending up to five years. Configured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") or, in limited cases, directly from Nutanix.


Our enterprise cloud platform typically includes one or more years of support and entitlements, which provides customers with the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Purchases of term-based licenses and SaaS subscriptions have support and entitlements included within the subscription fees and are not sold separately. Purchases of non-portable software are typically accompanied by the purchase of separate support and entitlements.
 Our Partners
 We have established relationships with channel, OEM, ecosystem and cloud partners, all of which help to drive the adoption and sale of our solutions with our end customers. Our solutions can be purchased through one of our channel partners or OEMs.
 Channel Partners. Our channel partners sell our solutions to end customers, and in certain cases, may also deliver our solutions to end customers through a managed or integrated offering. Our Elevate Partner Program simplifies engagement for our partner ecosystem using a consistent set of tools, resources, and marketing platforms. Our channel partners include distributors, resellers, managed service providers, telcos and global systems integrators. Arrow Electronics, Inc., a distributor to our end customers, represented 29%, 32% and 33% of our total revenue for fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Tech Data Corporation, another distributor to our end customers, represented 14%, 15% and 15% of our total revenue for fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
 OEM Partners. OEMs typically pre-install our software on hardware appliances and sell to end customers, and our offerings may also be sold through our OEMs and delivered directly to our end customers. Dell Technologies ("Dell"), Lenovo Group Ltd. ("Lenovo"), International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Fujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH ("Fujitsu"), Hewlett Packard Enterprise ("HPE") and Inspur Group ("Inspur") pre-install our software on their hardware to create the Dell XC Series, Lenovo Converged HX Series, IBM CS Series, Fujitsu XF Series, HPE DX Series and Inspur inMerge 1000 Series appliances, respectively. HPE also delivers our software with HPE DX Series Servers as a service through the HPE GreenLake offering. Some of our OEM partners also sell associated support offerings.
 Ecosystem Partners. We have developed relationships with a broad range of leading technology companies that help us deliver world-class solutions to our customers. Through the Technology Alliance Partner arm of our Elevate Partner Program, our developer, application, networking and security, data protection, hardware and infrastructure partners receive access to resources that allow them to validate and integrate their products with Nutanix solutions and engage in joint sales training and enablement. Such integrations enable a simpler deployment and consumption experience for our customers in their environments and increases adoption of our enterprise cloud platform. We have also developed and announced strategic technology partnerships that bring together best-in-class solutions across the ecosystem into integrated offerings and demonstrated interoperability and support for our customers, including partnerships with Red Hat, Citrix, and Intel. In addition, we work closely with our technology partners through co-marketing and lead-generation activities in an effort to broaden our marketing reach and help us win new customers while retaining existing ones.
 Cloud Partners. Our partnerships with public cloud providers help us to realize our vision of a hybrid multicloud. The deployment of Nutanix Cloud Clusters on AWS extends the availability of our core HCI software, along with all of our solutions, to bare metal Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances on AWS (currently generally available). We also have a partnership with Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") to offer a hybrid cloud solution on Microsoft Azure by extending Nutanix Cloud Clusters to Azure environments and ultimately enabling hybrid cloud management, on-premises or in Azure, through the Azure Arc control plane (currently in public preview and expected to become generally available in the future).
Our Support Programs
 Product Support. We offer varying levels of software support to our customers based on their needs. We also offer hardware support for customers who purchase the Nutanix-branded NX configured-to-order hardware appliances.
 Professional Services. We provide consulting and implementation services to customers through our professional services team for assessment, design, deployment and optimizing of their Nutanix environments. We typically provide these services at the time of initial installation to help the customer with configuration and implementation.
Our End Customers
 Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications, and big data analytics, and we support both virtualized and container-based applications. We have end customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology, and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our enterprise cloud platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers. We had a broad and diverse base of over 22,000 end customers as of July 31, 2022, including approximately 980 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries, and the total number of end customers may contract due to mergers, acquisitions, or other consolidation among existing end customers.
Growth Strategy
 Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 •Continually innovate and maintain technology leadership. Since inception, we have rapidly innovated from supporting limited applications and a single hypervisor to a full enterprise cloud platform that is designed to support a wide variety of workloads across private, public and hybrid multicloud deployments. We intend to continue to invest in developing our enterprise cloud platform with new features, services and products to expand our market opportunity in both core and adjacent markets.
 •Invest to acquire new end customers. We intend to grow our base of end customers by continuing to invest in sales and marketing, leveraging our network of channel partners and OEMs, grow our business internationally and extending our enterprise cloud platform to address new customer segments. One area of continued focus is increasing our sales to new, and expanding our sales to existing, large enterprise customers.
 •Continue to drive follow-on sales to existing end customers. Our end customers typically deploy our technology initially for a specific project or application deployment. Our sales teams and channel partners then seek to systematically target follow-on sales opportunities to drive additional purchases throughout our broader product portfolio, while also focusing on customer adoption and customer consumption of their original purchases. We believe this land and expand strategy enables us to quickly expand our footprint within our existing end customer base from follow-on orders that in the aggregate are often multiples of the initial order.
 

•Enhanced focus on renewals. In addition to our land and expand strategy described above, as part of our transition to a subscription-based model, we have enhanced our focus on renewals, which are typically associated with lower sales costs. While renewals have historically represented a small portion of our overall business, we expect that they will be a significant driver of our top-line growth as we continue our subscription transformation.
 •Deepen engagement with current channel, OEM, cloud and ecosystem partners and establish additional routes to market to enhance sales leverage. We have established channel partnerships globally and have driven engagement and commercial success with several major resellers and distributors. We believe that our OEM relationships can augment our routes to market and that there is a significant opportunity to grow our sales with our channel partners and OEMs. We intend to attract and engage new channel and OEM partners around the globe while also selling our standalone software for deployment on qualified hardware or a hosted service to maximize the availability of our solutions for our customers. We will also continue to establish partnerships with cloud and ecosystem partners to provide our customers with freedom of choice.
 •Invest in growth while balancing growth against operating expenses. We intend to continue investing in our growth, while balancing such growth against our operating expenses. By maintaining this balance, we believe we can drive towards profitable growth. Key drivers of our path towards profitability include growth in renewals (where the cost associated with renewals is generally lower than the cost associated with new subscriptions) and continuing to leverage sales and marketing efficiencies.
 Sales and Marketing
 Sales. We primarily engage our end customers through our global sales force who directly interact with key IT decision makers while also providing sales development, opportunity qualification and support to our channel partners. We have established relationships with our channel partners, who represent many of the key resellers and distributors of data center infrastructure software and systems in each of the geographic regions where we operate. We also engage our end customers through our OEM partners, which license our software and package it with their hardware and sell through their direct sales forces and channel partners. We expect to continue leveraging our relationships with our channel and OEM partners, and deepening relationships with our cloud and ecosystem partners, to reach our end customers.
 Marketing. We supplement our sales efforts with marketing programs that include online advertising, corporate and third-party events, demand generation activities, social media promotions, media and analyst relations and community programs. More recently, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we transformed nearly all of our in-person marketing programs into hybrid digital experiences. We also engage in joint marketing to expand market reach through an ecosystem of technology, channel, OEM service provider, and system integrator partners. Partners participating in our Nutanix Elevate Partner Program can gain eligibility for business development funds; targeted incentives; deal registration based pricing and field support; sales, services and technical training; innovative marketing campaigns; and dedicated account support.
Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets and supporting existing end customer deployments. Our research and development teams primarily consist of distributed systems software and user interface engineers. A large portion of our research and development team is based in San Jose, California. We also maintain research and development centers in India, North Carolina, Washington, Serbia, and Germany. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our continued research and development efforts and intend to continue to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of IT infrastructure technologies that we converge into our enterprise cloud platform. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.
Manufacturing
 We do not manufacture any hardware. The Nutanix-branded NX series appliances, including those that are delivered by us, are manufactured for us based on our specifications by Super Micro Computer, Inc. ("Supermicro"). Supermicro designs, assembles and tests the Nutanix-branded NX series appliances and it procures the components used in the NX series appliances directly from third-party suppliers. Our agreement with Supermicro was renewed in May 2021 for one year and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Distributors handle fulfillment and shipment for certain end customers, but do not hold inventory.
Competition
 We operate in the intensely competitive IT infrastructure market and compete primarily with companies that sell software and hardware to build and operate private clouds, integrated systems and standalone storage and servers, as well as providers of public cloud infrastructure solutions. These markets are characterized by constant change and rapid innovation. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
 •software providers, such as VMware, Inc. ("VMware") (which has agreed to be acquired by Broadcom Inc.), that offer a broad range of virtualization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise and hybrid clouds;
 •traditional IT systems vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Dell, HPE, Hitachi Data Systems ("Hitachi"), IBM and Lenovo, that offer integrated systems that include bundles of servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as a broad range of standalone server and storage products; 
 •traditional storage array vendors, such as Dell, Hitachi, Pure Storage, and NetApp, which typically sell centralized storage products; and
 •providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
 In addition, we compete against vendors of hyperconverged infrastructure products, such as Cisco, Dell, HPE, VMware and many smaller companies. As our market grows, we expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. Some of our competitors may also expand their product offerings, acquire competing businesses, sell at lower prices, bundle with other products, provide closed technology platforms, partner with other companies to develop joint solutions, or otherwise attempt to gain a competitive advantage. Furthermore, as we expand our product offerings, we may expand into new markets and we may encounter additional competitors in such markets. Additionally, as companies increasingly offer competing solutions, they may be less willing to cooperate with us as an OEM or otherwise.
 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
 •product features and capabilities;
 •system scalability, performance and resiliency;
 •management and operations, including provisioning, troubleshooting, analytics, automation and upgrades;
 •total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the technology;
 •customer freedom of choice over, and product interoperability with third-party applications, infrastructure software, infrastructure systems and platforms and public clouds;
 •application mobility across disparate silos of enterprise computing, including public and private cloud infrastructure; and
 •quality of customer experience, including usability, support and professional services.
 We are also venturing into a number of markets that are adjacent to our core HCI market, both through the expansion of HCI in hybrid multicloud environments as well as through our emerging products. These adjacent markets include areas such as disaster-recovery-as-a-service, cloud management, files and object storage, database automation and database-as-a-service, and desktop-as-a-service. Competitors in these markets include large, sophisticated companies that may have more experience or longer operating histories in these markets as well as new entrants.
 We believe that we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, a larger existing customer base, broader distribution and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2022, we had 346 United States patents that have been issued and 219 non-provisional patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2031 and 2040. We also leverage some open source software in most of our products.
 See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property.
 Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California where, under lease agreements that expire through May 2030, we currently lease approximately 432,000 square feet of space. Following an evaluation of our longer-term facilities plans due to our transition to a hybrid work environment, we recently entered into amendments to these lease agreements to reduce the leased space to approximately 215,000 square feet beginning in June 2024. We also maintain offices in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and that, should it be needed, we would lease suitable additional space to accommodate our operations.
Government Regulation
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, acquisitions, data protection and data privacy, employment and labor, and taxes could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to the potential impact of government regulation on our business.
Employees and Human Capital
 We had approximately 6,450 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2022. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils and/or industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 We understand the importance of human capital and prioritize building our culture, talent development, compensation and benefits, and diversity and inclusion. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
 At Nutanix, we value that our differences make us stronger: our diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives when shared, make us a more innovative and resilient team, and we can better delight and serve our customers when our teams reflect the diversity of businesses and communities we serve. Attracting, fostering, developing and retaining a diverse, inclusive culture is essential to the continued success of our business.
 Promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging ("DEIB") in our workforce is among our key corporate objectives, and to further support this objective we have implemented a number of initiatives, including expanding our employee resource groups, continuing our company-wide diversity training and overall education efforts, as well as mentorship programs, and forming global, cross-functional DEIB advisory groups. Our President and CEO, Rajiv Ramaswami, signed the CEO Action (an equity focused organization) pledge and by so doing joined a global community of CEOs dedicated to driving measurable collective action and meaningful change.
Total Rewards
We believe a robust, equitable, and competitive Total Rewards portfolio is essential to attracting and retaining diverse talent that moves Nutanix forward. We design reward and recognition programs that resonate wherever our talent sits in the world. Our reward packages are carefully crafted to offer physical, mental/emotional, and financial support to our employees and their families. We regularly review our programs and encourage employee feedback about what they value most. In addition to specifically tailored packages for each country based on local market practice and the competitive landscape, we also provide a range of globally available support programs such as an Employee Assistance Program, online health engagement and child development support.
Health, Wellness, and Safety
 Our priority is the health and safety of our employees. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to implement a number of precautionary measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees. This has included the implementation of a remote work policy. We also continue to support the well-being and continued development of our now primarily remote workforce by instituting during the pandemic quarterly well-being days, during which all employees may enjoy private time away from work requirements, and launching programs like quarterly well-being workshops, flexible work schedules, mindfulness sessions, and internal social media well-being challenges.
Growth and Development
 One of our culture principles is to Believe in Striving -- to constantly learn, continuously improve, and eternally evolve -- and to that end we invest resources to foster a learning culture throughout the company and to empower our employees to drive their personal and professional growth by equipping them with onboarding and learning programs. Our learning programs include digital learning; speed coaching; customized learning workshops; management enablement and skills training for current, new and future managers; training on diversity, inclusion, and belonging; language learning programs; and employee wellness programs. We believe that by empowering our employees as they strive to grow personally and professionally, we will be able to build a flexible and resilient workforce and maintain and nurture a robust pipeline of talent to fuel our future growth and strategy.
