ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Adhera Therapeutics, Inc. (“Adhera,” the “Company,” “we” “our” or “us”) is an emerging specialty biotech company that, to the extent that resources and opportunities become available, is strategically evaluating its focus including a return to a drug discovery and development company.
 
As described below, the Company was previously a commercially focused entity that leveraged innovative distribution models and technologies to improve the quality of care for patients in the United States suffering from chronic and acute diseases with a focus on licensed fixed dose combination therapies for hypertension. On January 4, 2021, the licensor terminated the licensing agreement for the product candidate. As a result, we were left with several license agreements, none of which we are exploiting.
 
On July 28, 2021, we as licensee and Melior Pharmaceuticals II, LLC (“MP2”) entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of MLR-1019. MLR-1019 is being developed as a new class of therapeutic for Parkinson’s disease (“PD”) and is, to the best of our knowledge, the only drug candidate today to address both movement and non-movement aspects of PD. Under the Agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to use MP’s patents and know-how related to MLR-1019 to develop products in consideration for cash payments upon meeting certain performance milestones as well as a royalty of 5% of gross sales.
 
On August 20, 2021, we as licensee entered into an exclusive license agreement with Melior Pharmaceuticals I, Inc., (“MP1”). In this Report, we refer to MP2 and MP1 as “MP” or “Melior”. This second license is for the development and commercialization of MLR-1023, which is being developed as a novel therapeutic for Type 1 diabetes.
 
On October 20, 2021, we as licensee expanded the exclusive MLR-1023 licensing agreement with MP1 to include two additional clinical indications, one for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) and the other for pulmonary inflammation.
 
The milestones and payment obligations and other material terms under the foregoing license agreements with Melior are summarized in the subsection titled “Partnering and Licensing Agreements” of this Form 10K.
 
To the extent that resources have been available, we have continued to work with our advisors in an effort to restructure our company and to identify potential strategic transactions, including the Melior transactions described above to enhance the value of the company. Because of our substantial unpaid debt, if we do not raise additional capital in the immediate future, it is likely that the company will discontinue all operations and may seek bankruptcy protection.


Corporate History
 
Adhera was incorporated under Delaware law under the name Nastech Pharmaceutical Company on September 23, 1983

On November 15, 2016, Adhera entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IThenaPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ithena”), IThena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of IThena (“Merger Sub”), and a representative of the stockholders of IThena (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThena, with IThena surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adhera (such transaction, the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThena common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Adhera common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.
 
IThena was incorporated under Delaware law on September 3, 2014. IThena is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and thus the historical financial statements of IThena will be treated as the historical financial statements of our company and will be reflected in our quarterly and annual reports for periods ending after the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we started to report the results of IThena and Adhera and their respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 
Subsequent to the Merger, we acquired the rights to commercialize Prestalia, an anti-hypertensive drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals LLC in June 2017 pursuant to a license agreement. We marketed Prestalia in the U.S. from June 2018 until December 2019. The license agreement together with all rights to future commercialization activities with respect to the product was terminated in January 2021.

Need for Future Financing
 
We will require substantial additional funds on an immediate basis to continue our business operations. We have in the past raised additional capital to supplement our commercialization, clinical and pre-clinical development and operational expenses through the issuance of common stock, indebtedness including promissory notes and convertible notes, and other derivative securities which have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders. We will need to raise additional funds through equity financing, debt financing, strategic alliances, or other sources, which may result in significant further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares or result in further encumbrances being placed on our assets. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or that it will be sufficient for us to successfully engage in any of our planned business operations, including re-starting the drug development and discovery programs relating to our legacy RNA interference assets and furthering the research and development efforts with respect to product candidates under our licenses from Melior. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis as required or generate significant capital from the out-licensing and/or divestiture of existing assets, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and will be forced to scale down or even cease our operations altogether.


We presently have $1.5 million of convertible notes and approximately $200,000 in accrued interest outstanding which notes are in default. In addition, we have $5.7 million of non-convertible notes and approximately $2.0 million of accrued interest which are also in default. Our ability to raise capital is contingent upon our obtaining forbearance from the majority of the outstanding non-convertible debt holders. We cannot assure you we will be successful in obtaining this approval.


Partnering and Licensing Agreements
 
Melior
 
As described above, the Company has acquired licenses to develop and commercialize certain products owned by Melior. The below table summarizes the milestones and payment obligations under each such license agreement.
 
MLR-1019:
 
Under the MLR-1019 license, we agreed to make the following milestone payments if the applicable milestone is reached:
 

Milestone | Milestone Payment | 
----------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------
Last patient enrolled into the Phase 2a study | $ | 250,000 
Positive outcome of the Phase 2a study | $ | 1,500,000 
Initiation of a Phase 3 study | $ | 10,000,000
New Drug Application approval | $ | 10,000,000
Total Milestone Payments | $ | 21,750,000



Under the license, the Company also agreed to royalty payments of 5% of gross sales if the product is commercialized. The MLR-1019 license terminates upon the last expiration of the patents licensed by the Company, which is presently 2034 subject extensions and renewals of any of such patents. If the Company fails to have its common stock listed on Nasdaq or the NYSE within 12 months after the Company receives a Clinical Trial Authorization from the European Medicines Agency, then the Company’s commercial license and rights to MLR-1019 under the license agreement will terminate. 
 
MLR-1023:
 
Under the MLR-1023 license, we agreed to make the following milestone payments if the applicable milestone is reached:
 

Milestone | Milestone Payment | 
--------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------
Last patient enrolled into the Phase 2a study | $ | 250,000 
Positive outcome of the Phase 2a study | $ | 1,500,000 
Initiation of a Phase 3 study | $ | 10,000,000
New Drug Application approval | $ | 10,000,000
Total Milestone Payments | $ | 21,750,000

 
The agreement also included royalty payments upon commercialization of the product as follows: (i) 8% of future gross product sales, applicable to the first $400,000,000 of gross product sales; (ii) 10% of future gross product sales, applicable to sales after $400,000,000 and up to $800,000,000; and (iii) 12% of future gross product sales applicable to sales after $800,000,000.
 
If we fail to obtain a financing resulting in at least $4.0 million of proceeds, hire a Chief Scientific Officer with familiarity with both MLR-1019 and MLR-1023, and use our best efforts to uplist to Nasdaq by June 16, 2022, the MLR-1023 license agreement will terminate. If we meet that deadline, the MLR-1023 license terminates upon the last expiration of the patents licensed by the Company.

Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property
 
We have relied primarily on patents and contractual rights and obligations with third parties to protect our proprietary rights and further our operational objectives. We have sought, and, to the extent that we continue our business operations, intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. To date, the U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications that we have filed, and the patents that have been granted to us, relate to our legacy intranasal and RNA interference programs. As noted elsewhere in this Report, we are in the process of evaluating the path forward for such programs, including seeking options to continue certain programs or to divest assets. There can be no assurance that any of our patents will be guaranteed protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates, and to the extent that we do not properly maintain (including paying any required fees) such patents, it is possible that any protection provided to us will be impaired or lost altogether.
 
We also use license agreements both to access external intellectual property rights and technologies and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. To the extent that we continue our business operations, our financial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain (and maintain) commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
 
Further, we have purchase rights for the Licensed Products including the patents and related intellectual property from Melior with respect to the following product candidates:
 

● | MRL 1019 (Patent No. 10,188,651) for the treatment of PD; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | MRL 1023 (Patent No. 11,033,548) for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, NASH and pulmonary inflation.

Sales and Marketing
 
We terminated our commercial activities related to Prestalia in December 2019, and the license agreement was subsequently terminated by the licensor in January 2021. Our activities in 2021, were primarily related to inventory storage and destruction for Prestalia.
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of any products and product candidates that we may develop or acquire, to the extent that we may continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, are their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge and experience provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major and minor pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many of these competitors have greater for capital resources and access to capital than we do, and personnel with more industry experience and scientific background than those we utilize. Our products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and/or acquire, and later commercialize, will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
We anticipate that many of the companies against which we may compete in the future will have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, product acquisition, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete, or may compete, with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and products complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.
 
The commercial opportunity for any product candidates that we may acquire and/or develop could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may acquire or develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. See “Risk Factors” for more information on the risks we face with respect to our competition.
 
To date, we have not fully developed, received regulatory approval for or commercialized any of our current product candidates. Our ability to compete will depend, to a great extent, on the speed in which we and our collaborators can develop safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes, and coordinate with third parties to produce and distribute the resulting products in sufficient commercial quantities to create and maintain a market for such products at favorable costs and prices. If we do complete development of and obtain regulatory approval to market any product candidate, we anticipate that the competition we would face with respect to such product would be based on a combination of a number of factors including efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other factors.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drugs and pharmaceutical products. To the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, of which there can be no assurance, all of the products that we anticipate seeking to develop and/or commercialize are expected to be regulated as drug products.
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and other laws within the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions. Before any drug products that we may develop and/or acquire are marketed, they must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a drug product is approved by the FDA include: (1) pre-clinical laboratory, animal, and formulation tests; (2) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; (3) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; (4) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); (5) satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and FDA review; and finally (6) approval of an NDA.
 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician-investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed, to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks; and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population. To the extent that we engage in any clinical studies, our product development partners, the FDA, or we may suspend clinical trials, if any, at any time on various grounds, including any situation where we or our partners believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information. If the FDA approves the NDA, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval of any products that we develop and/or acquire will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP in December 2010. We are evaluating the best path forward to re-start development activities regarding CEQ508, and evaluating options for our other programs relating to RNA interference.
 
In addition, regardless of the type of approval, to the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, we and our partners will be required to comply with a number of FDA requirements both before and after approval with respect to any products that we may develop, acquire or commercialize. For example, we and our partners will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
 
In addition to FDA regulations for the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:
 

● | The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment; 
● | The federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government; 
● | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials; 
● | State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; 
● | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which among other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure; and 
● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information; 

 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
If we bring a product candidate to clinical trial, we may undertake to commence such a trial in a foreign jurisdiction, in which case we and third parties on which we rely would be subject to such foreign government’s laws and regulations pertaining to the research and development, including clinical testing on human subjects, of therapeutic product candidates. Further, to the extent that any of the products that we develop and/or acquire are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. None of our products were ever developed or sold outside the United States.
