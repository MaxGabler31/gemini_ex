ITEM 1.       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
THE COMPANY
 
The Company was formed and organized on September 28, 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are an exploration stage company and our principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources in Idaho initially, and elsewhere in the future. We have not presently determined whether the property to which we have mining rights contain mineral deposits that are economically recoverable.
 
The Company's head office is located at 602 Cedar Street, Suite 205, Wallace, Idaho 83873.
 
Center Star Mine Project
 
Background
 
Effective July 1, 2020, Magellan entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Clearwater Gold Mining Corporation (“Clearwater”) which owns certain unpatented mining claims in Idaho County. Idaho that include the historic Center Star Gold Mine near Elk City, Idaho. The Center Star Mine hosts high grade gold mineralization that was discovered in the early 1900’s. There was periodic historic production and development work done under different ownership through the 1980s. With the high-grade gold mineralization present, Magellan will be evaluating the historic mine data to assess the potential to develop a gold resource at Center Star. The project area is located 45 miles from Grangeville, Idaho and near the town of Elk City, Idaho.
 
In consideration for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Clearwater, Magellan has agreed to pay its sole shareholder 1,000,000 shares of Magellan common stock and $150,000 in cash. Of the 1,000,000 shares, 750,000 shares have been issued and 250,000 shares will be issued two years from the closing concurrent with the pay-off of the secured promissory note. The cash consideration of $25,000 was paid and the balance of $125,000 is evidenced by a secured promissory note due in two years. The Note is secured by the Clearwater shares and assets.
 
Based upon our research, gold mineralization at Center Star Mine is hosted in multiple parallel quartz veins in a banded gneiss. Like many of the historic mines in the Elk City area the gold is present in steeply dipping quartz veins. The gold at the Center Star Mine occurs in high grade veins that trend north-easterly and dip steeply to the southeast. These veins are present in a 75’ to 100’ wide sheer zone hosting quartz veins and breccia. It is believed the gold bearing veins vary from inches to 20 feet in width and contain gold from .35 ounce per ton gold to multi ounce per ton gold based on historic mine data. The property was historically developed by various owners and has had some production history of gold and silver production. The Center Star Mine has not had any exploration or development work conducted in the last 35 years.

Unpatented Mining Claims: The Mining Law of 1872
 
Except for the Langtry Property, our mineral rights consist of leases covering "unpatented" mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872, or the “General Mining Law.” Unpatented mining claims are unique U.S. property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain. The validity of an unpatented mining claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. In addition, there are few public records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims. We have not filed a patent application for any of our unpatented mining claims that are located on federal public lands in the United States and, under possible future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents may be difficult to obtain.
 
Location of mining claims under the General Mining Law, is a self-initiation system under which a person physically stakes an unpatented mining claim on public land that is open to location, posts a location notice and monuments the boundaries of the claim in compliance with federal laws and regulations and with state location laws, and files notice of that location in the county records and with the BLM. Mining claims can be located on land as to which the surface was patented into private ownership under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916, 43 U.S.C. §299, but the mining claimant cannot injure, damage or destroy the surface owner's permanent improvements and must pay for damage to crops caused by prospecting. Discovery of a valuable mineral deposit, as defined under federal law, is essential to the validity of an unpatented mining claim and is required on each mining claim individually. The location is made as a lode claim for mineral deposits found as veins or rock in place, or as a placer claim for other deposits. While the maximum size and shape of lode claims and placer claims are established by statute, there are no limits on the number of claims one person may locate or own. The General Mining Law also contains provision for acquiring five-acre claims of non-mineral land for millsite purposes. A mining operation typically is comprised of many mining claims.
 
The holder of a valid unpatented mining claim has possessory title to the land covered thereby, which gives the claimant exclusive possession of the surface for mining purposes and the right to mine and remove minerals from the claim. Legal title to land encompassed by an unpatented mining claim remains in the United States, and the government can contest the validity of a mining claim. The General Mining Law requires the performance of annual assessment work for each claim, and subsequent to enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. §1201 et seq., mining claims are invalidated if evidence of assessment work is not timely filed with BLM. However, in 1993 Congress enacted a provision requiring payment of $140 per year claim maintenance fee in lieu of performing assessment work, subject to an exception for small miners having less than 10 claims. No royalty is paid to the United States with respect to minerals mined and sold from a mining claim.
 
The General Mining Law provides a procedure for a qualified claimant to obtain a mineral patent (i.e., fee simple title to the mining claim) under certain conditions. It has become much more difficult in recent years to obtain a patent. Beginning in 1994, Congress imposed a funding moratorium on the processing of mineral patent applications which had not reached a designated stage in the patent process at the time the moratorium went into effect. Additionally, Congress has considered several bills in recent years to repeal the General Mining Law or to amend it to provide for the payment of royalties to the United States and to eliminate or substantially limit the patent provisions of the law.
 
Mining claims are conveyed by deed, or leased by the claimant to the party seeking to develop the property. Such a deed or lease (or memorandum of it) needs to be recorded in the real property records of the county where the property is located, and evidence of such transfer needs to be filed with BLM. It is not unusual for the grantor or lessor to reserve a royalty, which as to precious metals often is expressed as a percentage of net smelter returns.
 
Location, History and Geology of our Property
 
Center Star Mine
 
The property is located near Elk City, Idaho on the south side of the Clearwater River about 42 miles southeast of Grangeville, Idaho. The property consists of 31 unpatented lode claims totaling 620 acres. The company owns 100% of the property.

Location and Access
 
The property, Center Star Mine, is located 42 miles southeast of Grangeville, Idaho in Section 26 and 35 of Township 29 N, Range 7 E.B.M. in the Ten Mile Mining District.
 
Access to the property is gained by a paved state highway connecting Grangeville and Elk City. A good mountain road approximately 5 miles in length extends from the highway to the mine. The mountain road is of a sufficient quality to transport equipment and materials to the mine. The road is typically snowed in during certain winter months but could be maintained to allow for year-round access.
 


The Center Star Mine is located in an area that currently has significant interest from other junior exploration companies, as shown in the map below:

History
 
The Center Star deposit was discovered by Jim Murphy, a pocket hunter, who found rich float in the gulch below the mine. Herman Brown and later Charles Tiedeman acquired interests in the property. These men did the first development work on the property by first trenching on the hillsides and then driving the Murphy crosscut. They encountered a mineralized zone about 30 feet wide which contained veins of varying width and which averaged from 0.8 to 1 ounce of gold per ton. In 1915, Tiedeman installed a 1-stamp mill and milled some ore from the Murphy crosscut but he netted only about a 50% recovery. About 1917, an interested party including one Mr. Weiss drove a crosscut into the ore zone about 100 feet below the Murphy level and did some drifting. Here they found the ore contained more sulfides with an increase of silver and copper. H. L. Day and associates on their own account did additional exploratory work in 1930 and 1931 which included the sinking of an incline winze to a depth of 150 feet. Because there was no road to or mill on the property plus the fact that the price of gold was only $20.00 an ounce, Mr. Day abandoned the project in 1931.
 
In 1934 Mr. and Mrs. M. F. Ward of Lewiston, Idaho acquired an option on the property and built the present road to the mine. In 1938 they purchased a 1/ 3 interest in the property and financed the construction of the mill and other buildings. During the period 1939 to 1942, Messrs. Ward and William Walker leased the remaining two-thirds interest in the mine from Brown and Tiedeman.
 
The first production of concentrates from this mill was made late in 1939 and was continued on a limited basis until the Gold Closing Order L-208 forced the stoppage of operations in 1942. During this period there was considerable development work done.
 
During a roughly 33-month time frame from 1939 to 1942 the mine produced about 5,000 ounces of gold and 6,000 ounces of silver.
 
In 1946 and 1947, Mr. and Mrs. Ward purchased the remaining 2/ 3 interest in the claims and continued to maintain the property. Except for 1959-1960 when about $5,000.00 worth of concentrates were produced there has been no other production since 1946. Following Mr. Ward's death in November 1958, a rehabilitation and modernization program was planned by Mrs. Ward with the assistance of Harold C. Lynch.
 
In 1961 the Center Start Gold Mine, Inc was incorporated, and the property was acquired from Mrs. Genevieve (Ward) Lynch.
 
In 1968 Center Star Gold Mines, Inc. completed a public offering and the Center Star Mine was reactivated. Also, in 1968 a 6,800-foot power line was constructed and put into operation bringing electric power to the site.
 
From 1968 to 1970 the underground workings were advanced an additional 500 feet. In 1971 the Center Mine was placed on standby awaiting more favorable gold prices.
 
In 1980 the Center Star Mine was reopened. Between 1980 and 1981 the Center Star completed a $500,000 mine renovation, sampling and drilling program. Over 2,000 samples were taken from various areas of the mine and the drill program resulted in defining an ore block estimated at 30,000 tons with grades between .46 and .63 ounces to the ton.
 
At some point between 1983 and 1984 the Center Star was once a gain placed on standby due to low gold prices.
 
In 1985 mill and equipment and several buildings on the property were removed and salvaged.
 
At some point between 1986 and 1987 the property was acquired by Mariner Explorations, Inc. Mariner Explorations did an extensive sapling and mapping of the area on the property adjacent to existing working.
 
At some point subsequent to Mariner Explorations surface exploration work the property was acquired by Gregory Schifrin, who sold the property to Magellan Gold in 2020.

Power and Water
 
Power to the mine site will initially be provided by a diesel generator and a diesel compressor. In 1968 the mine site was connected to a 3-phase electrical power line. The power line is no longer operable but can be replaced in the future.
 
Water to the site is available from a year-round mountain stream that should be adequate to meet the properties’ needs.
 
Geology
 
The Center Star Mine is located in Idaho about midway between Golden and Elk City. It appears to be in the Central Idaho Belt series and is in the Ten-mile Mining District. The mine area is composed of banded Pre-Cambrian Belt gneisses and schists. The general area has been faulted; intrusions of granite dikes and hornblendite sills are prominent.
 
The following composite level map shows the extent of known historical workings at the mine:
 

The country rock is well-banded quartz biotite gneiss. Near quartz intrusions the country rock is highly silicified and in fractured zones is brecciated. The regional trend of the county rock foliation is approximately north and south.
 
A series of faults and brecciated zones cuts through the country rock. The general trend of the faulted areas is approximately north 70 degrees east and dips 40 degrees or more to the southeast.
 
Quartz follows faulted zones, forming elongated veins and is also found as a replacement of gneiss. However, gneissic banding is preserved in the quartz and the wall rock is not easily distinguished from the quartz in the replacement zones. These zones show a gradation from quartz, to gneissic banded quartz to silicified gneiss, to gneiss. Along some faults, gouge and brecciated wall rock is more than two feet thick. Quartz usually shows more brecciation than silicified gneiss. Quartz is also greatly shattered in the fractured zones.

Sulfides are disseminated in the vein quartz and silicified wall rock and fill small fractures and shattered zones. The most abundant of these are pyrite and chalcopyrite. However, galena and sphalerite are commonly exposed in brecciated zones of quartz and wall rock.
 
The ore is found as irregular and generally elongated bodies following faults which strike approximately N 70 degrees E. A shear zone 100 feet wide, extending from about 240 feet in the Weiss tunnel contains all the ore to be seen in the present mine workings. A series of faults parallel each other within this zone. The country rock, surrounding the shear zone, is composed of schist and gneiss. Intrusions of granite cutting the country rock are exposed in the Weiss tunnel. The schists and gneisses grade into silicified rock at the contact of the shear zone.
 
Drifting followed quartz veins which vary in thickness from one inch to ten feet, averaging about five feet. The quartz veins pinch and swell throughout their exposed length with alternate brecciation. Gouge of varying thickness follows both walls of the quartz veins. Brecciation of the quartz and silicification of the gneisses and schists presumably took place at the time of later faulting and fracturing. Later quartz introduction apparently occurred periodically; this later quartz contains most of the sulfides and gold. Quartz in some zones grades gradually into silicified all rock; in these zones no contact can be established between silicified wall rock and quartz. However, quartz veinlets were observed extending into the wall rock. These veinlets contain sulfides and some gold.
 
No Proven or Probable Mineral Reserves/Exploration Stage Company
 
We are considered an exploration stage company under SEC criteria since we have not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves at any of our properties. In Industry Guide 7, the SEC defines a “reserve” as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proven or probable mineral reserves are those reserves for which (a) quantity is computed and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely that the geologic character is defined and size, shape and depth of mineral content can be established (proven) or the sites are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced but high enough to assume continuity between observation points (probable).
 
Mineral Reserves cannot be considered proven or probable unless and until they are supported by a feasibility study, indicating that the mineral reserves have had the requisite geologic, technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable.
 
We have not completed a feasibility study with regard to all or a portion of any of our properties to date. Any mineralized material discovered or extracted by us should not be considered proven or probable mineral reserves. As of the date of this Memorandum, none of our mineralized material met the definition of proven or probable mineral reserves. We expect to remain an exploration stage company for the foreseeable future, even though we were extracting and processing mineralized material. We will not exit the exploration stage until such time, if ever, that we demonstrate the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves that meet the guidelines under SEC Industry Guide
 
OUR EXPLORATION PROCESS
 
Our exploration program is designed to acquire, explore and evaluate exploration properties in an economically efficient manner. We have not at this time identified or delineated any mineral reserves on any of our properties.
 
We expect our exploration work on a given property to proceed generally in three phases. Decisions about proceeding to each successive phase will take into consideration the completion of the previous phases and our analysis of the results of those phases.
 
The first phase is intended to determine whether a prospect warrants further exploration and involves:
 

· | researching the available geologic literature;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | interviewing geologists, mining engineers and others familiar with the prospect sites;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | conducting geologic mapping, geophysical testing and geochemical testing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


· | examining any existing workings, such as trenches, prospect pits, shafts or tunnels;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | digging trenches that allow for an examination of surface vein structures as well as for efficient reclamation, contouring and re-seeding of disturbed areas; and,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analyzing samples for minerals that are known to have occurred in the test area.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Subject to obtaining the necessary permits in a timely manner, the first phase can typically be completed on an individual property in several months at a cost of less than $200,000.
 
The second phase is intended to identify any mineral deposits of potential economic importance and would involve:
 

· | examining underground characteristics of mineralization that were previously identified;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | conducting more detailed geologic mapping;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | conducting more advanced geochemical and geophysical surveys;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | conducting more extensive trenching; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | conducting exploratory drilling.
--+---------------------------------

 
Subject to obtaining the necessary permits in a timely manner, the second phase can typically be completed on an individual property in nine to twelve months at a cost of less than $1 million. None of our properties has reached the second phase.
 
The third phase is intended to precisely define depth, width, length, tonnage and value per ton of any deposit that has been identified and would involve:
 

· | drilling to develop the mining site;
--+-------------------------------------


· | conducting metallurgical testing; and
--+--------------------------------------


· | obtaining other pertinent technical information required to define an ore reserve and complete a feasibility study depending upon the nature of the particular deposit, the third phase on any one property could take one to five years or more and cost well in excess of $1 million. None of our properties has reached the third phase.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to explore and develop our properties ourselves, although our plans could change depending on the terms and availability of financing and the terms or merits of any joint venture proposals.
 
Our Exploration Plans
 
Past exploration, development and production on the property has identified a number of ore bodies and targets for future exploration. Potential for additional mineralization is very good as known veins and ore bodies appear to be open in all directions. We will use known mineralization areas from previous geological reports to identify exploration targets.
 
We are developing a geological mapping, with rock sampling and assaying programs that will focus on taking samples from previously sampled high-grade areas to test and verify historical geological reports. Successful completion of the mapping and sampling program will help guide a drilling program to better define historically reported ore blocks and resource estimates.

Subject to securing the necessary, we have budgeted $500,000 for exploration work over the next 6 to 12 months. Comprising of $150,000 for sampling, assaying, mapping and computer modeling and $300,000 for diamond drilling, assaying and mapping.
 
We anticipate the exploration program will be supervised by Gregory Schifrin, a director of the company.
 
MARKETING
 
All of our mining operations, if successful, will produce gold or silver in doré form or a concentrate that contains gold or silver.
 
We plan to market our refined metal and doré to credit worthy bullion trading houses, market makers and members of the London Bullion Market Association, industrial companies and sound financial institutions. The refined metals will be sold to end users for use in electronic circuitry, jewelry, silverware, and the pharmaceutical and technology industries. Generally, the loss of a single bullion trading counterparty would not adversely affect us due to the liquidity of the markets and the availability of alternative trading counterparties.
 
We plan to refine and market its precious metals doré and concentrates using a geographically diverse group of third party smelters and refiners. The loss of any one smelting and refining client may have a material adverse effect if alternate smelters and refiners are not available. We believe there is sufficient global capacity available to address the loss of any one smelter.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
General
 
Our activities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, mine development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of our properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, we must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays.
 
Although we are committed to environmental responsibility and believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent implementation of these laws and regulations through judicial review or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.
 
Federal Environmental Laws
 
Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste, although such wastes may be subject to regulation under state law as a solid or hazardous waste. The EPA has worked on a program to regulate these mining wastes pursuant to its solid waste management authority under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). Certain ore processing and other wastes are currently regulated as hazardous wastes by the EPA under RCRA. If our future mine wastes, if any, were treated as hazardous waste or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) for cleanup, material expenditures would be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities or for other remediation expenditures. Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or an owner or operator at the time of its contamination generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owner or operator may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our future tailings and waste disposal, if any, in Nevada under the Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and state law counterparts. We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and we do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Additional regulation or requirements under any of these laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.
