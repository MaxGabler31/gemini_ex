ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Argan, Inc. (“Argan”) conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (“GPS”), Atlantic Projects Company Limited and affiliates (“APC”), The Roberts Company, Inc. (“TRC”) and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (“SMC”) (together referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Through GPS and APC, the Company provides a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development, technical and other consulting services to the power generation market including the renewable energy sector. The wide range of customers includes independent power producers, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms with projects located in the United States (the “U.S.”), the Republic of Ireland (“Ireland”) and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). GPS and APC represent the Company’s power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southeastern region of the U.S. and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated metal components such as piping systems and pressure vessels. Through SMC, which conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.
Holding Company Structure
Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 1961. We intend to make additional opportunistic acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable growth and realizable synergies with one or more of our existing businesses. However, we may have more than one industrial focus depending on the opportunity. We expect that companies acquired by Argan will be maintained in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding company with current investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC.
Power Industry Services
The most significant percentage of our power industry services has been performed by GPS which is a full-service engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services firm that we have operated for over fifteen years since it was acquired by us in 2006. GPS has the proven abilities of designing, building and commissioning large-scale energy projects in the U.S. The extensive design, construction, project management, start-up and operating experience of GPS has grown with installed capacity exceeding 15 gigawatts of mostly domestic power-generating capacity. Our power projects have included base-load combined-cycle facilities, simple-cycle peaking plants and boiler plant construction and renovation efforts. We also have experience in the renewable energy sector by providing EPC contracting and other services to the owners of alternative energy facilities, including biomass plants, wind farms and solar fields. Typically, the scope of work for GPS includes complete plant engineering and design, the procurement of equipment and construction from site development through electrical interconnection and plant testing. The durations of our construction projects typically range between one to three years. However, the length of certain significant construction projects may exceed three years.
This reportable business segment also includes APC, a company formed in Ireland over 45 years ago, and its affiliated companies, which we acquired in May 2015. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment engineering, procurement, installation, commissioning and outage services to primarily utility-scale power plant operators, major data center operators, original equipment manufacturers and global construction firms. With its presence in Ireland, the U.K. as well as the U.S., APC represents the portion of this segment’s business with an international focus. 
The revenues of our power industry services business segment were $398.1 million, $319.4 million and $135.7 million for the years ended January 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”), 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”) and 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”), respectively, or 78%, 81% and 57% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. The substantial portions of the revenues of this reportable segment reported for these three years were derived from the performance of activities by GPS and APC under EPC services and other construction contracts with the owners of power plant projects.

Guernsey Power Station
In January 2019, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct an 1,875 MW natural gas-fired power plant in Guernsey County, Ohio (the “Guernsey Power Station”). Caithness Energy, L.L.C. (“Caithness”) led the development of this project. After receiving a full notice-to-proceed, GPS commenced substantial activities for this project in August 2019. The Guernsey Power Station is the largest, single-phase, gas-fired, power plant construction project in the U.S. For Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, this project represented the major portions of consolidated revenues. Substantial completion of this project is expected to occur during the second half of our fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023”).
Guernsey County is located in southeastern Ohio in the heart of the state’s Utica and Marcellus shale gas development area. Using state-of-the-art combined cycle technology and an air-cooling system, the Guernsey Power Station will be a cost-efficient, fuel-efficient, electricity generating power plant that protects air quality and conserves water with the capability to satisfy the electricity needs of approximately one million homes.
The combined cycle design of this plant utilizes three power trains, with each one including a gas-fired turbine, a heat recovery steam generator and a steam turbine, that will enable this plant to generate significantly more power from the equivalent amount of fuel than a traditional gas-fired power plant. The Guernsey Power Station will also use dry cooling technology to reduce water usage by as much as 95% compared to a water-cooled power plant. Because of its advanced design, the power plant will achieve the lowest possible air emissions. 
Maple Hill Solar
In May 2021, we announced that GPS entered into an EPC services contract with CPV Maple Hill Solar, LLC, an affiliate of Competitive Power Ventures, Inc. (“CPV”), to construct the Maple Hill Solar facility. Project activities were begun by GPS immediately. Project completion is currently scheduled to occur during the second half of Fiscal 2023. The unique Maple Hill Solar project, which is located on previously cleared timber property in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, will be constructed using over 235,000 photovoltaic modules to generate approximately 100 MW of electricity which is enough to power more than 18,000 homes.
Kilroot Power Station
In October 2021, APC entered into an engineering and construction services contract with EPUKI London, U.K., which is an affiliate of EPUKI, a Czech company, to construct a 2 x 330 MW natural gas-fired power plant in the Carrickfergus area near Belfast, Northern Ireland, that will replace an existing coal-fired power plant at the site. The facility is being developed by EPNI Energy Limited. A notice to proceed was received and project activities have commenced. The overall project completion date is expected in the latter half of our fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (“Fiscal 2024”).
Other APC Construction Works
The Irish operations of APC are performing the design, build and operations of a dedicated power plant within a major data center. The size and configuration of the facility, consisting of up to nine (9) gas-fired turbines, is a first-of-a-kind within the Irish data center market. The Irish operations are also completing construction activities for a major computer chip manufacturer. Both of these Irish projects are located near Dublin. 
As of January 31, 2022, the U.K. operations of APC have nearly completed the installation of a synchronized condenser for the combined cycle, gas-fired power plant located at the Isle of Grain site in the Kent region of the U.K. Finally, during Fiscal 2022, the U.K. operations of APC completed subcontracted construction efforts for the Teesside Renewable Energy Plant (“TeesREP”) which is located in the northeast region of England. TeesREP is a 299 MW biomass-fueled power station that will burn primarily wood pellets in order to generate electricity sufficient to power 600,000 homes. APC was responsible primarily for the mechanical installation of the boiler for one of the largest bio-mass-fueled power stations in the world. 
Major Customer Contracts
At January 31, 2022, the project backlog for this reporting segment was approximately $0.7 billion. The comparable backlog amount as of January 31, 2021 was approximately $0.8 billion. Our reported amount of project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded to us that we consider to be firm as of that date less the amounts of 

- 4 -



revenues recognized to date on the corresponding projects. The project backlog amount that we disclose is larger than the value of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, or RUPO, on active contracts (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). As of January 31, 2022, the difference between the amount of project backlog of $0.7 billion and the lesser RUPO amount of $0.4 billion is the EPC services contract with ESC Harrison County Power, LLC, that is described below.
Typically, we include the total value of EPC services and other major construction contracts in project backlog when we receive a corresponding notice to proceed from the project owner. However, we may include the value of an EPC services contract prior to the receipt of a notice to proceed if we believe that it is probable that the project will commence within a reasonable timeframe, among other factors. Projects that are awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for extended periods of time as customers experience project delays. 
As we have discussed at previous reporting dates, GPS has been awarded other EPC services contracts for which commencement of project activities have been delayed. We have maintained that the delays in the construction starts of these projects and the awards of new business awards to GPS relate to a variety of factors, especially in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. where the electricity grid is run by PJM Interconnection LLC (“PJM”). Certain projects in development are confronting difficulties in obtaining the necessary permits for construction and operation, in securing the delivery of fuel to the power plant site and in establishing the necessary power connection to the electricity grid. Currently, we believe that the ability of the owners of fully developed gas-fired power plant projects to close on equity and permanent debt financing is challenged by uncertainty in the capital markets caused by multiple factors including delayed capacity auctions and mounting public and political opposition to fossil-fuel energy projects. 
In January 2020, GPS entered into an EPC services contract with Harrison Power, LLC (“Harrison Power”) to construct a 1,085 MW natural gas-fired power plant in the Village of Cadiz, Harrison County, Ohio. The project is being developed by EmberClear, the parent company of Harrison Power, and Advanced Power Services (NA) Inc. We anticipate adding the value of this contract to project backlog closer to its financial close and expected start date. Previously, we anticipated that the start of construction activities for this project would occur before the end of Fiscal 2022. However, the start dates for construction are generally controlled by the project owners and certain delays prevented the start of this project from occurring during Fiscal 2022. Nevertheless, as the project owners have continued to progress their activities, we are cautiously optimistic that the start of construction activities for this project will occur before the end of Fiscal 2023. 
In May 2019, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct a 625 MW power plant in Harrison County, West Virginia. Caithness is partnered with ESC Harrison County Power, LLC to develop this project. As a limited notice to proceed with certain preliminary activities was received from the owner of this project at the time, the value of the contract was added to our project backlog. However, meaningful project development activities for the facility appear to be limited. We believe that it is significant that this project is included in the new services queue of PJM with a recently updated status indicating work is being performed by PJM to assure the plant’s interconnection to the electricity grid. Nonetheless, if meaningful development milestones are not achieved, our evaluation may result in the removal of the value of this power plant from project backlog during Fiscal 2023.
On March 12, 2020, we announced that GPS had entered into an EPC services contract with NTE Connecticut, LLC to construct the Killingly Energy Center, a 650 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Killingly, Connecticut. The facility is being developed by NTE Energy, LLC (“NTE”). However, in November 2021, the New England electricity grid operator requested that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) grant it permission to terminate its capacity supply contract with NTE because it did not believe that NTE would meet its critical path schedule milestones as required; permission was subsequently granted. This termination has significantly reduced the likelihood that this power plant will be built. 
As announced in Fiscal 2019, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Chickahominy Power Station, a 1,740 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Charles City County, Virginia. We did not include the value of this contract in our project backlog. We provided financing through notes receivable from the consolidated VIE that was established by the project owner and that was dedicated to the development efforts. We also provided technical support to the project. Significant development milestones were achieved by the project owner. However, a planned gas pipeline expansion that the project owner believed would supply natural gas to the power plant was rejected by Virginia’s State Corporation Commission during Fiscal 2022, which led to cancellation by PJM of its interconnection service agreement with the project based on alleged failures of the project to meet required milestones. In February 2022, PJM received notice from FERC 

- 5 -



accepting PJM’s termination of the service agreement which effectively removed the Chickahominy Power Station from PJM’s planning queue. In summary, the project owner was unable to secure an alternative fuel-supply for the plant and the project lost its interconnection service commitment from PJM. Therefore, the project owner was unable to obtain the necessary equity financing for the project and we ceased providing project development funding. We concluded that the completion of the development of this project is significantly jeopardized and that it is doubtful that construction of this power plant will occur. In March 2022, the project owner issued a public statement that the project was cancelled (see additional discussion regarding this matter below in the “Special Purpose Entities” section).
We believe that it is important to note that the owners of two of our contracted natural gas-fired power plant projects have plans to integrate green hydrogen solution packages developed by a major gas turbine manufacturer. While the plants will initially burn natural gas alone, it is planned by the respective project owners that the plants will eventually burn a mixture of natural gas and green hydrogen, thereby establishing power-generation flexibility for these plants.
Despite our commitment to the construction of state-of-the-art, natural gas-fired power plants as important elements of our country’s electricity-generation mix in the future, we are targeting business development efforts to win projects for the erection of utility-scale wind farms and solar fields and for the construction of other renewable energy projects. We have successfully completed these types of projects in the past and we are renewing efforts to obtain new work in the renewable power sector that will complement our natural gas-fired EPC services projects going forward, like the Maple Hill Solar energy project. 
Special Purpose Entities
We selectively participate in power plant project development and related financing activities 1) to maintain a proprietary pipeline for future EPC services contract opportunities, 2) to secure exclusive rights to EPC contracts, and 3) to generate profits through interest income and project development success fees. EPC contractors in our industry also periodically execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project or program for a project owner. These special purpose entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. 
In January 2018, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of a VIE that was performing the project development activities related to the construction of the Chickahominy Power Station. The account balances of the VIE have been included in the consolidated financial statements since then, including capitalized project costs that have been included in property, plant and equipment. After reaching the conclusions discussed above and consistent with the disclosure included in the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed on January 24, 2022, we recorded an impairment loss during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 related to all of the capitalized project development costs in the amount of $7.9 million, of which $2.5 million was attributed to the non-controlling interest.
Labor and Materials
We perform work on job sites in different states and countries. The skilled craft labor pool is unique in each region due to a variety of factors, including union versus non-union work environments, competing infrastructure projects located nearby our sites that utilize the same labor pool as us, and decreased and aging labor pools resulting from demographic trends. As such, we take a carefully considered and tailored approach at each job site to acquire and retain the required personnel resources when we need them, especially craft labor, and to maintain optimum productivity on each of our projects. Depending on the project, we may utilize direct hires, subcontractors, existing internal personnel, or a combination of the three. To date, we have managed generally to staff each of our jobs safely and effectively. 
Overall, employment in the domestic construction industry is nearing the pre-pandemic high. The industry’s unemployment rate has dropped to 6.7% for February 2022. The number of unemployed job seekers with construction experience has declined by about 26% over the last year. The rising employment has been accompanied by higher wages that have risen by approximately 5.1% over the last year as well. 
However, in staffing each new project with the skilled craft labor needed to complete the job successfully, we may be challenged by labor shortages in the construction industry, rising wages, demographic trends and other factors. Going forward, competition for labor may include employers outside the construction industry that can offer the one job benefit that construction companies can’t which is the opportunity to work remotely. In short, labor shortages are expected to persist into the next fiscal year as wages rise.

In connection with the engineering and construction of traditional power plants, biodiesel plants and other renewable energy systems, we procure materials for installation on our various projects. We are not dependent upon any one source for major equipment components, like heat recovery steam generation units, steam turbines and air-cooled condensers, or any other construction materials that we use to complete a particular power project. In general, we have not experienced significant schedule delays related to the procurement or delivery of the necessary materials for our major projects in the past.
With our assistance, project owners frequently procure and supply certain major components of the power plants such as state-of-the-art natural gas turbines. We have significant experience in delivering EPC projects with the latest turbine technology and working with all three major gas-fired turbine manufacturers to meet each project owner’s specific power plant requirements. EPC project requirements may vary considerably. Our personnel possess the skills and experience needed to overcome the plant design, development and construction challenges presented by each EPC services project, thereby steadily eliminating uncertainties throughout the development lifecycle and construction phases of each project.
We sourced certain supplies, materials and equipment from countries stricken by the COVID-19 pandemic, as did certain of the major original equipment manufacturers for major components of natural gas-fired power plants. Disruptions to these supply chains, or the supply and productivity of labor at job sites, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic or other causes may continue to challenge our schedules, and may ultimately affect our ability to complete our large fixed-price contract projects in accordance with original schedules. For example, the supply of solar panels to projects in the U.S has been slowed. We believe that we have protections in our contracts with major customers that provide certain relief that helps to mitigate certain financial risks. These protections could be limited depending on the underlying issues and the financial challenges of our customers. 
The extent of the operational and financial impacts on us probably will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions prove to be. As we go forward, there may be unscheduled delays in the delivery of materials and equipment ordered by us or a project owner or other unanticipated challenges to our ability to complete major job tasks when planned, among other impacts, none of which are quantifiable at this time. We have actively attempted to manage these risks during this period of uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The costs of materials needed for the completion of our projects may fluctuate from time to time. In times of increased volatility similar to those being experienced currently, we take steps to reduce our risks. For example, we may hold quotes related to materials in our industrial fabrication and field services segment for only three days. For major fixed price contracts in our power industry services segment, we may mitigate material cost risks by procuring the majority of the equipment and construction supplies during the early phases of a project. During Fiscal 2022, we believe in general that we effectively confronted the economic challenges to our active jobs from the global surge in material costs. 
While our operations were challenged by the well-publicized global supply chain disruptions during Fiscal 2022, the management of the risks associated with the inability to obtain machinery, equipment and other materials when needed continued to include our best efforts. However, we are concerned that the supply chain uncertainties may be impacting project owners’ confidence in commencing new work which may adversely affect our expected levels of revenues until the supply chain disruptions dissipate.
Competition
GPS competes with large and well capitalized private and public firms in the construction and engineering services industry like Kiewit Corporation, one of the largest construction firms in the country, and other global firms providing engineering, procurement, construction and project management services. These and other competitors are multi-billion-dollar companies that may have thousands of employees. We also may compete with regional construction services companies in the markets where planned projects might be located. Typically, a condition for award is that the contractor perform on a fixed-price or lump-sum contract basis; smaller elements of a contract may be billable on an allowance or cost-reimbursable basis. As explained below, there are risks of unrecovered costs, among other features, associated with these types of contracts.
To compete with these firms, we emphasize our proven track record as a value-add choice for the design, build and commissioning of natural gas-fired and alternative energy power systems. Our successful experience includes the efficient completion and maintenance of natural gas-fired combined cycle and simple cycle power plants, wood/coal-fired plants, waste-to-energy plants, wind farms, solar fields and biofuel processing facilities, most performed on an EPC contract basis.

Through the power industry services segment, we provide a full range of competitively priced development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management and maintenance services to project owners. We are able to react quickly to their requirements while bringing a strong, experienced team to help navigate through difficult technical, scheduling and construction issues. We believe that the cultures of GPS and APC encourage motivated, creative, high energy and customer-focused teams that deliver results. Our projects are directed by dedicated on-site project management teams and our project owner customers have direct access to our senior management at these companies. 
APC also competes regularly with much bigger, more well-established companies for larger projects. These companies include the John Wood Group PLC and METKA, the sustainable engineering solutions business unit of Mytilineos S.A.
Our competition for domestic renewable energy projects like solar energy fields and land-based wind energy farms is more diverse and may include firms that are smaller than us. 
The competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plant construction has changed significantly over the last five (5) years. While the market remains dynamic, we are moving into an era where there may be fewer competitors for new domestic gas-fired power plant EPC services project opportunities. Several major competitors have exited the market for a variety of reasons or have been acquired. Others have announced intentions to avoid entering into fixed-price contracts.
Nonetheless, fixed-price contracting in the U.S. has continued to occur due to intense competition that has increased the bargaining power of project owners and sustained the number of projects typically completed on a fixed-price basis. Competition has led to aggressive bidding on projects while certain contractors have accepted greater risks associated with the inability to anticipate unforeseen issues and the failure to include adequate contingencies to cover lower-than expected labor productivity, unfavorable execution challenges and unusual weather events, for example. As a result, construction and engineering companies have incurred losses related to performance on fixed-price contracts, including some of the largest firms in the country.
We are not immune to these risks. As described extensively in prior reports, we incurred a loss in connection with the performance of the fixed price portion of our TeesREP subcontract in the final amount of $29.5 million. Nonetheless, we try to be particularly selective in pursuing new project opportunities and are reluctant to enter into fixed-price contracts with perceived high-risk profiles. The track record of GPS has proven that fixed-price contracts can provide opportunities for higher margins if the corresponding projects are completed at lower-than-planned costs. We are confident that our project management teams have gained the experience necessary for successful execution on these types of contracts as we go forward although we are aware of the risks involved.
Over the past few years, GPS has provided top management guidance and project management expertise to APC as it completed its subcontract efforts for the TeesREP power plant and won the award of the project to build the new gas-fired power plant in Northern Ireland. APC has provided project management manpower to GPS on several of its EPC services contracts. These recent experiences have demonstrated that the two companies can combine resources effectively. We expect that GPS and APC will continue to work together in the future given the apparent emerging new business opportunities in the U.K. and Ireland, the strength of the reputation of GPS for successfully completing large gas-fired power plant projects in the U.S. and the growing recognition in the power community in the British and Irish islands that APC is committed to and capable of tackling larger and more complex power projects.
Customers
For Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, our most significant customer was Guernsey Power Station LLC, the owner of the Guernsey Power Station project, which accounted for approximately 57% and 67% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years. For Fiscal 2020, the Company’s most significant power industry services customers were the owner of the Guernsey Power Station project and Técnicas Reunidas UK Limited, APC’s customer on the TeesREP project. Each customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues and together they represented 37% of consolidated revenues for the year.
No other customer of this reportable segment represented greater than 10% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 or Fiscal 2020.

Regulation
Our power industry services operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement and employee compensation requirements. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The power plants that we build, and other energy facilities including the pipelines required to supply natural gas fuel to them, are also subject to a myriad of federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental protection, air quality, water quality and noise and height restrictions. The growing preference for renewable energy sources and the elimination of fossil-fueled power plants by the populations of the U.S. and the U.K. may result in such restrictions becoming more severe in the future. The consequences may result in fewer gas-fired power plants being constructed in the future than are currently forecast offset by an increased number of renewable power facility opportunities.
Relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its apparent decline in the U.S. and Western Europe, local and national government health agencies in the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland are easing the onerous restrictions on places and/or events where people may gather in close proximity to others. However, the occurrence of severe future outbreaks where our projects are located would most likely result in the reinstatement of such restrictions which could severely hamper our abilities to conduct construction activities on job-sites, or could shut-down such sites completely. However, we do believe that our office-based employees have demonstrated the ability to work effectively on a remote basis, if necessary, for extended periods of time. 
Industrial Fabrication and Field Services
TRC was founded in 1977 and is located near Greenville, North Carolina. TRC is principally an industrial field services provider and pipe and vessel fabricator for industrial organizations primarily in the southeast region of the U.S. Its facilities include two metal fabrication plants and support structures. TRC operates within its own reportable business segment, industrial field services and fabrication. Industrial field services typically represent over 75% of TRC’s annual revenues with the remaining revenues contributed by projects performed in its two metal fabrication plants. 
The major customers of TRC include large fertilizer companies such as Nutrien Ltd. (“Nutrien”); a gold-mining company located in South Carolina, OceanaGold Corporation; a world leading supplier of industrial gases, Air Liquide S.A.; North America’s largest forest products companies such as Weyerhaeuser Company and Domtar Corporation; and various other industrial companies. For Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, TRC reported revenues of $97.9 million, $65.3 million and $94.7 million, respectively, or approximately 19%, 17% and 40% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
TRC increased its income from operations to $8.3 million for Fiscal 2022 from $0.6 million for Fiscal 2021. TRC has achieved positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), for each of the past six years of operations although the financial performance over this period has been uneven and inconsistent. Based on the current backlog and number of new business opportunities, we expect that TRC will report favorable results again for the newly commenced fiscal year.
Since the acquisition of TRC, we have provided it with $9.0 million in net cash so that it could fund the completion of the work on certain loss contracts in progress on the date of the acquisition, enhance working capital in support of business growth and stability, acquire capital equipment to assure efficient and competitive fabrication and field operations and support other general corporate needs. TRC has periodically returned cash to Argan and no cash has been advanced to TRC since May 2019. 
The latest business valuations of TRC did not result in any goodwill impairment losses for Fiscal 2022 or Fiscal 2021. The uneven operating results of TRC did result in a series of prior year goodwill impairment losses. The originally established balance of the goodwill of TRC, $14.4 million, has been written down to a net balance of $9.5 million as of January 31, 2022. 

- 9 -



The impacts of COVID-19 did result in delays in certain contract awards and project starts which resulted in revenue shortfalls for Fiscal 2021. However, effective business development efforts have rebuilt the project backlog of TRC which has been grown over the last two years by $30.5 million to $44.5 million as of January 31, 2022.
Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
SMC represents our telecommunications infrastructure services reportable business segment and conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, which provides comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to customers primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. We perform both outside and inside plant cabling.
Services provided to our outside premises customers include trenchless directional boring and excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor lighting systems. The outside premises services are primarily provided to state and local government agencies, regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial customers. The wide range of inside premises wiring services that we provide to our customers include structured cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the physical transport for high-speed data, voice, video and security networks. These services are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities.
Consistently, a major portion of SMC’s revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with SMC’s major customers such as Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, a local electricity cooperative. Over the last three years, other major customers have included counties and municipalities located in Maryland; certain state government agencies in Maryland; and technology-oriented government contracting firms in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. 
The revenues of SMC were $13.4 million, $7.6 million and $8.6 million for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, or approximately 3%, 2% and 3% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
Late in Fiscal 2022, SMC acquired the business of Lee Telecommunications, Inc. (“LTI”) for consideration of $0.6 million in cash, which expanded the business footprint of SMC into the Tidewater area of Virginia. LTI provides a suite of communications infrastructure services similar to those provided by SMC. The largest customer of LTI is Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, to which it has been providing services since 1995. 
The combined operations of SMC operate in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services industry. We compete with providers ranging from regional companies to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in our market space by emphasizing our high-quality reputation, outstanding customer base, security-cleared personnel and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts. Based on its reputation and quality performance, SMC was selected on a sole source basis to perform outside premises and structured cabling work at several secure overseas locations during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020.
Employees
The total number of personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and the relative amount of work performed by subcontractors. We had 1,358 employees at January 31, 2022, substantially all of whom were full-time. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
Financing Arrangements
During April 2021, we amended our Amended and Restated Replacement Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America (the “Bank”). The amendment extended the expiration date of the Credit Agreement to May 31, 2024 and reduced the borrowing rate. The Credit Agreement, as amended, includes the following features, among others: a lending commitment of $50.0 million including a revolving loan with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 1.6% (reduced from 2.0%), and an accordion feature which allows for an additional commitment amount of $10.0 million, subject to certain conditions. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover other credit instruments issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business as defined in the Credit Agreement.

At January 31, 2022, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. However, the Bank has issued letters of credit in the total outstanding amount of $21.5 million in support of the activities of APC under new customer contracts.
The Company has pledged the majority of its consolidated assets to secure its financing arrangements. The Bank’s consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank requires that the Company comply with certain financial covenants at its fiscal year-end and at each of its fiscal quarter-ends. The Credit Agreement, as amended, includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature, including a requirement to achieve positive adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as defined, over each rolling twelve-month measurement period. As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Agreement.
Financial markets around the globe are preparing for the pending discontinuation of LIBOR, which is the widely used indicator of basis for short-term lending rates. The transition from LIBOR is market driven, not a change required by regulation. The U.S. and other countries are currently working to replace LIBOR with alternative reference rates. We do not expect that the replacement of LIBOR as the basis for the determination of our short-term borrowing rate will have any significant effects on our financial arrangements with the Bank or our financial reporting. 
Safety, Risk Management, Insurance and Performance Bonds
We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits. GPS, APC, TRC and SMC each has an experienced full-time safety director committed to ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable permits, insurance and local and environmental laws. Our OSHA reportable incident rates, weighted by hours worked for all of our subsidiaries, were 0.48, 0.55 and 0.40 for calendar years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; our rates were significantly better than the national average rates in our industry (NAICS – 2379) for those years.
We retain qualified insurance brokerage assistance in the regular evaluation of the adequacy of insurance coverage amounts and the annual negotiation of premium amounts in the areas of property and casualty insurance, general liability, umbrella coverage, director and officer insurance and other specialty coverages. We believe that our insurance coverage amounts are adequate, but not excessive, and provide the proper amounts of coverage where we believe insurable risks may exist.
Contracts with customers in each of our reportable business segments may require performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. We maintain material amounts of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and, as indicated above, we have the commitment of the Bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million in support of our bonding collateral and other business requirements. 
As of January 31, 2022, the revenue value of our unsatisfied bonded performance obligations was approximately $235.1 million. In addition, there were bonds outstanding in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.0 million covering other risks including our warranty obligations related to completed activities. Not all of our projects require bonding.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Matters
Our on-going commitment to environmental, health and safety, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, sustainability, and other public policy matters relevant to us is being supported by the ESG subcommittee of our board of directors, which was formed in Fiscal 2021. Its charter requires it to assist our senior management in: (a) setting our general strategy relating to ESG matters, as well as developing, implementing, and monitoring initiatives and policies for us based on that strategy; (b) overseeing communications with employees, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to ESG matters; and (c) anticipating and monitoring developments relating to, and improving management’s understanding of, ESG matters.
A summary of our ESG accomplishments in various areas over the past three years follows: 

● | We refreshed our Code of Conduct to strengthen the comprehensive anti-corruption, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment sections, to emphasize respect for human rights, and to make other updates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We increased the percentage of independent members of our board of directors while increasing its diversity;

● | We commenced a solicitation of recommendations from our employees by an ESG cross-subsidiary working group in order to identify additional actionable items including coordinated community service projects. As a result, employees from all levels of our Company have participated in projects such as Habitat for Humanity, Toys for Tots, school supply drives and Company-sponsored youth programs, while supporting meaningful apprenticeships and internships within our companies.

A significant amount of effort was spent by senior and project management to ensure the safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic while we continued to satisfy our customer obligations. While our pro-active efforts varied depending on the particular job or office location, and other factors including the severity of the outbreak, we implemented a number of different safety measures, including COVID-19 on-site testing at major job sites, remote work, staggered shifts in various offices, contract tracing and quarantines.
As an important element of our business development strategy, we are targeting a number of contract awards that will expand the amount of our renewable energy project work. In May 2021, GPS commenced activities pursuant to the EPC services contract to construct the Maple Hill Solar facility, which we believe will be among the largest solar-powered energy plants in Pennsylvania. For Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, the amounts of revenues earned by us and associated with renewable energy projects were 13.4% and 10.8% of corresponding revenues for the power industry services segment. We expect that revenues associated with the performance of renewable energy projects will become a more meaningful percentage of our segment and consolidated revenues over the coming years.
Meanwhile, we believe that our gas-fired power plant construction business is valuable to the achievement of the net carbon emission reduction goals of the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland as we are recognized as an accomplished, dependable and cost-effective provider of construction services to gas-fired power plant owners.
Like the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland are committed to the increase in energy consumption sourced from wind and the sun on the pathway to net zero emissions. In those countries, there appears to be recognition that these sources of electrical power are inherently variable. Other technologies will be required to support these power sources and to provide electricity when power demands exceed the amount of electricity supplied by renewable energy sources. The existence of the necessary power reserve during the long transition period to zero emissions will require supporting conventional power generation sources, typically natural gas-fired power plants.
The Irish government has issued a policy statement on the security of the electricity supply in Ireland which confirms the requirement for the development of new support technologies to deliver on its commitment to have 80% of the country’s electricity generated from renewables by 2030. The report emphasizes that this will require a combination of conventional generation (typically powered by natural gas), interconnection to other jurisdictions, demand flexibility and other technologies such as energy storage (i.e., batteries) and generation from renewable gases (i.e., biomethane and/or hydrogen produced from renewable sources). The Irish government has announced that the development of new conventional generation (including gas-fired generation) is a national priority and should be permitted and supported in order to ensure the security of electricity supply while supporting the growth of renewable electricity generation. 
In the U.S., it is fact that power plant carbon emissions declined by 35% during the period 2010 through 2020. The primary reason for this decline was the replacement of coal-fired power plants with efficient gas-fired power plants. Natural gas is relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable.
