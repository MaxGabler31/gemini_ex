ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company initially focused on developing our clinically-validated and patent-protected PLxGuard delivery system to provide more effective and safer products. Our PLxGuard delivery system works by releasing active pharmaceutical ingredients into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine immediately below the stomach, rather than in the stomach itself. We believe this may improve the absorption of many drugs currently on the market or in development and reduces gastrointestinal (GI) side effects common in an acute setting — including erosions, ulcers and bleeding — associated with aspirin and ibuprofen, and potentially other drugs.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved our lead product, Vazalore 325 mg, which is a novel formulation of aspirin using the PLxGuard delivery system intended to provide better antiplatelet effectiveness for cardiovascular disease prevention as compared to the current standard of care, enteric-coated aspirin, and significantly reduce GI side effects as compared with immediate-release aspirin. Vazalore 325 mg (formerly PL2200 Aspirin 325 mg and Aspertec 325 mg) was originally approved under the drug name aspirin, and the proprietary name ‘Vazalore’ was granted subsequent to the FDA approval. A companion 81 mg dose of the same novel formulation — Vazalore 81 mg — is in late-stage development and will be the subject of a supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”), leveraging the already approved status of Vazalore 325 mg. We are focused on manufacturing, scale-up and label finalization for Vazalore 325 mg aspirin dosage form and preparing an sNDA for Vazalore 81 mg maintenance dosage form.  Our goal is to begin selling both products in the United States by mid-2020, subject to approval by the FDA.
 
Products and Strategy
 
Our commercialization strategy will target both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and prescription markets, taking advantage of the existing OTC distribution channels for aspirin while leveraging the FDA approval of Vazalore 325 mg and expected approval for Vazalore 81 mg for OTC and prescription use when recommended by physicians for cardiovascular disease treatment and prevention. Given our clinical demonstration of better antiplatelet efficacy (as compared with enteric-coated aspirin) and better GI safety, we intend to use a physician-directed sales force to inform physicians — and, by extension, consumers — about our product’s clinical results in an effort to command both greater market share and a higher price for our next generation aspirin product. Our product pipeline also includes other oral NSAIDs using the PLxGuard delivery system that may be developed, including a clinical-stage, GI-safer ibuprofen — PL1200 Ibuprofen 200 mg — for pain and inflammation.
PLxGuardTM Delivery System 
 
Our PLxGuard delivery system uses surface acting lipids, such as phospholipids and free fatty acids, to modify the physiochemical properties of various drugs and selectively release these drugs to targeted portions of the GI tract. Unlike tablet or capsule polymer coating technologies (e.g., enteric coating), which rely solely on drug release based on pH differences in the GI tract, the PLxGuard delivery system utilizes both the differential pH in the GI tract and the presence of bile acid bicarbonate and pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum to target Vazalore’s release. This approach is intended to more reliably and precisely release active pharmaceutical ingredients in the duodenum and decrease their exposure to the stomach, which is more susceptible to NSAID-induced bleeding and ulceration. The PLxGuard delivery system is a platform technology that we believe may be useful in improving the absorption of many acid labile, corrosive, and insoluble or impermeable drugs.
 
We believe our PLxGuard delivery system has the potential to improve many already-approved drugs and drugs in development because it may:
 

● | enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of the drug using our technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve the GI safety of the drug;
--+-----------------------------------


● | provide new or extended patent protection for an already-approved or development-stage drug; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | utilize the 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (“NDA”) regulatory path, which may provide a faster and lower-cost FDA approval route when used with already-approved drugs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The PLxGuard delivery system has clinically proven these benefits with our novel formulations using aspirin and has clinical evidence supporting the potential for a GI-safer ibuprofen and preclinical evidence supporting the potential for a GI-safer oral diclofenac and intravenous indomethacin products. Other existing or new drugs in development that may benefit from the PLxGuard delivery system will be evaluated either by us or through collaboration agreements with other companies.

Product Pipeline
 
Our lead product, Vazalore 325 mg, has been approved by the FDA for OTC distribution and is the first-ever FDA-approved liquid-filled aspirin capsule. No further clinical trials are required for approval of Vazalore 81mg. In clinical trials in diabetic patients at risk for cardiovascular disease, Vazalore 325 mg demonstrated better antiplatelet efficacy than enteric-coated aspirin, which is the current standard of care for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment. Vazalore 325 mg delivers faster antiplatelet efficacy than enteric-coated aspirin with a median time to 99% inhibition of serum Thromboxane B2 of two hours compared with 48 hours for enteric-coated aspirin. Near complete inhibition of serum Thromboxane B2 (>99%) is a clinically accepted marker for antiplatelet efficacy, which is sometimes referred to as aspirin response. Vazalore 325 mg has more reliable and predictable bioavailability resulting in 5 times greater aspirin absorption versus enteric-coated aspirin after 3 days of treatment. This greater bioavailability translates into consistent and sustained antiplatelet benefits with twice as many patients achieving a complete antiplatelet response after 3 days treatment compared with enteric-coated aspirin. The faster and more reliable platelet inhibition achieved with Vazalore 325 mg may be particularly important in the hospital management of acute vascular events such as heart attacks and strokes where platelet inhibition is absolutely critical but also for the long-term protection from recurrent events. Vazalore 325 mg has also demonstrated improved GI safety compared with immediate release aspirin with statistically significant 71% reduction in the risk for ulcers in healthy subjects in an acute setting. The lower risk for GI complications can have important benefits including better drug tolerance for the patients (less dyspepsia, bloating, etc.), less use of stomach acid reducers (antacids, proton pump inhibitors, etc.) and lower risk for GI bleeding. This GI-safety may also be particularly important in the acute hospital setting where patients with acute vascular events such as heart attacks and strokes are at very high risk for GI bleeding due to the acute stress associated with the episode and the co-administration of other blood thinners (i.e. heparin) that are standard components of the treatment protocols. Finally, the GI safety benefit may also be used to differentiate Vazalore 325 mg from products intended for use in conditions associated with pain and inflammation, including other aspirin and NSAID products.
 
Vazalore 81 mg is our lower-dose companion product for Vazalore 325 mg (the two dose forms are sometimes referred to in this Form 10-K together as “Vazalore”). This product utilizes exactly the same formulation as the 325 mg product (except delivered in a capsule one quarter the size) and will be the subject of an sNDA, which we expect to submit to the FDA in late 2019. We will rely on the clinical results of Vazalore 325 mg for the Vazalore 81 mg sNDA and do not anticipate any additional clinical trials will be required, effectively positioning this product as an end of Phase 3 status. Our goal is to begin selling both products in the United States by mid-2020, subject to approval by the FDA.
 
We also believe our technology may be used with other selected NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. We have used the PLxGuard delivery system to create a lipid-based formulation of ibuprofen, PL1200 Ibuprofen 200 mg, for the OTC market, and PL1100 Ibuprofen 400 mg, for prescription doses of ibuprofen. We have OTC and prescription (Rx) Investigational New Drug applications (“INDs”) active with the FDA and have demonstrated bioequivalence with the OTC 200 mg dose ibuprofen to support a 505(b)(2) NDA in fasted-state clinical trials at three different doses, 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg. Using the PL1200 capsules at prescription doses, we demonstrated better GI safety in osteoarthritic patients with equivalent analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy, when compared with prescription ibuprofen in a six-week endoscopy pilot clinical trial. PL1200 and PL1100 Ibuprofen may be considered as being in Phase 1 in the FDA approval process and may qualify for the 505(b)(2) NDA path.
 
Manufacturing and Supplies 
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop or own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required ingredients and finished products for Vazalore and other product candidates. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of these third parties. We do not have any contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Vazalore or other product candidates if they are approved. As our commercial sales grow we anticipate entering into agreements with one or more back-up manufacturers as appropriate for additional commercial production of Vazalore or other product candidates. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. The relevant manufacturers and potential manufacturers of Vazalore have orally advised us that they are compliant with both current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and current Good Laboratory Practices (“cGLP”). There can be no assurance that Vazalore or other product candidates, if approved, can be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost.
 
We and our contract manufacturers are and will be subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the manufacture of any pharmaceutical product. We and our contract manufacturers must ensure that all of the processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP and cGLP for drugs on an ongoing basis, as mandated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and conduct extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers.
 
We believe that most of the ingredients we require to manufacture Vazalore are readily available from multiple suppliers and are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis of proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include the therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and cost. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop products that may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials.
 
Vazalore faces competition from many companies with OTC aspirin products. These include branded products from Bayer AG, Prestige Brands, Inc. (Ecotrin, Goody’s, BC Powder) and Foundation Consumer Healthcare, LLC (St. Joseph) and private label or store brands (CVS, Walgreens). Aspirin is approved in the United States for multiple uses. In addition to cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, OTC aspirin may be used for the treatment of pain, inflammation and fever. There are two aspirin products for cardiovascular disease prevention that are approved by the FDA for prescription use owned by Genus Lifesciences, Inc. (Yosprala) and Espero BioPharma, Inc. (Durlaza) that are to the best of our knowledge not currently marketed in the US. There are a variety of aspirin and NSAID products in various stages of development in the United States and globally that represent potential competition when and if they become approved by the FDA and are commercialized. Companies and academic institutions involved include Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), Oxford Pharmascience Group Plc, Antibe Therapeutics Inc. and The City College of New York. Vazalore and other pain and inflammation product candidates such as PL1200 Ibuprofen will face competition from many firms. These include OTC and prescription products. Major competitors include Pfizer Inc. (Advil), Johnson & Johnson (MotrinIB, Tylenol), Bayer AG (Aleve) and private label or store brands (CVS, Walgreens).
 
The aspirin market is currently predominantly composed of generic products either branded (e.g. Bayer) or private label (e.g. CVS). Vazalore 325 mg is the only liquid-filled aspirin capsule product to be approved by the FDA. Vazalore 325 mg went through a different regulatory approval process than the current OTC aspirin products being marketed in the US. Vazalore 325 mg was approved under the 505(b)(2) NDA process and, when launched, is expected to be the only OTC available aspirin-based product that successfully passed this rigorous process. We believe the clinical trials that demonstrated better efficacy and safety will assist us in differentiating Vazalore from the competition. Other product candidates will undergo clinical trials to provide differentiation as part of their product development and commercialization.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our core novel technology. To establish and protect our proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.

Patent Portfolio
 
On January 8, 2003, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with The Board of Regents of the University of Texas System (“UT”), as described in more detail in the section herein titled “License Agreements—UT License Agreement”, which was amended, restated on December 11, 2009, and subsequently amended on April 15, 2011 and on December 17, 2011 (as amended, the “UT License Agreement”). The patents in-licensed under the UT License Agreement constitute an important part of our intellectual property. This family of patents includes composition of matter, methods of manufacturing and methods of treatment that provide protection for Vazalore, PL1200 Ibuprofen and other NSAID product candidates in the United States and in a number of global markets. The following is a summary of the patents in-licensed under the UT License Agreement and their respective expiration dates:

● | Methods and compositions employing formulations of lecithin oils and NSAIDs for protecting the gastrointestinal tract – includes five issued U.S. patents with the earliest expiration on December 19, 2021 and the latest expiring on March 23, 2022 and 24 issued patents in other jurisdictions expiring on December 19, 2021, and one pending patent application in Brazil.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compositions and methods for treating and/or ameliorating cancer, the onset of cancers or the symptoms of cancers – includes one issued U.S. patent expiring on May 22, 2026, and five issued patents in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Singapore, expiring on August 2, 2024.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sterile preparations of phospholipids and anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals and methods of making and using same – includes five issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, India, Israel and Singapore, expiring on August 2, 2024.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Purified phospholipid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug associated compositions and methods of preparing and using same – includes one issued U.S. patent expiring on June 3, 2026 and two issued patents in other jurisdictions, including Australia and Mexico, expiring on October 12, 2025.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have developed our own patent applications, some of which have issued and others, if issued with claims as filed, will provide patent protection for Vazalore 325 mg and 81 mg, other NSAID products and will broaden the opportunity for new products to include many different drug classes. In the United States we have three patents issued from the “pH dependent carriers for targeted release of pharmaceuticals along the gastrointestinal tract, compositions therefrom and making and using same” family consisting of U.S. patent numbers 9216150, 9226892 and 9730884, expiring on September 29, 2032, in China issued number ZL201280058596X expiring on September 28, 2032, in Hong Kong issued number HK1200098 expiring September 29, 2032, in Australia issued number 2012315545 expiring September 29, 2032 and in Mexico we have issued patent number 340951 expiring on September 29, 2032. We have received Notice of Allowance in Japan and in the United States and Mexico for additional claims. We have pending applications in Europe, Canada, India, and South Korea and in the United States and Japan for additional claims which, if issued, are expected to provide patent protection through September 29, 2032.
 
U.S. patent numbers 8,865187 and 9351984 with “Compositions comprising lecithin oils and NSAIDs for protecting the gastrointestinal tract and providing enhanced therapeutic activity”, U.S. patent number 9,101637 with “Methods of treating inflammation with compositions comprising lecithin oils and NSAIDs for protecting the gastrointestinal tract and providing enhanced therapeutic activity,” and U.S. patent numbers 9216150 and 9226892 with “pH dependent carriers for targeted release of pharmaceuticals along the gastrointestinal tract, compositions therefrom and making and using same” are listed in the FDA Orange Book. As new patents are issued relative to FDA approved products such as Vazalore 325 mg and 81 mg, they will be added to the Orange Book and, as new products are approved by the FDA, the relevant patents will be added to the Orange Book. The Orange Book lists patents that protect each drug. Patent listings and use codes are provided by the drug application owner, and the FDA is obliged to list them. In order for a generic drug manufacturer to win approval of a drug under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”), the generic manufacturer must certify that they will not launch their generic pharmaceutical product until after the expiration of the Orange Book-listed patent, or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or that the generic product will not infringe the listed patent.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review.

License Agreements
 
UT License Agreement
 
On January 8, 2003, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Texas (“UT License Agreement”). The patents in-licensed under this agreement constitute an important part of our intellectual property. This family of patents includes composition of matter, methods of manufacturing and methods of treatment that provide protection for Vazalore, PL1200 Ibuprofen and other NSAID product candidates in the United States and in a number of global markets. Pursuant to the UT License Agreement, UT granted us an exclusive license under its patents and know-how related to their NSAID-phospholipid technology to develop and commercialize NSAID products for use anywhere in the world. Certain of the technology was developed with government funding, and the exclusivity of our license is therefore subject to certain retained rights of the U.S. federal government. We are responsible for the development and commercialization of the licensed products under the agreement. The UT License Agreement is in effect as long as the patents are valid and we may terminate the UT License Agreement at our option with appropriate notice. Also, if we fail to actively attempt to commercialize licensed products for a specific period of time, UT may have the option to terminate or limit the exclusivity of the license in certain territories. Specifically, Section 4.6 of the UT License Agreement provides that “Reasonable commercial diligence shall require that the Company . . . . [o]n or before September 8, 2013, Sell or offer for Sale a Licensed Product.” While we believe that we have exercised reasonable commercial diligence to actively attempt such commercialization, we have not yet successfully commercialized a licensed product. As such, UT may have the option to terminate the UT License Agreement, or to limit the exclusivity of the license in certain territories. The UT License Agreement provides for milestone payments related to the first product to obtain regulatory approval to sell a licensed product, which milestone payments have been paid. The UT License Agreement provides for future potential milestone payments based upon the aggregate revenue from the sale of all licensed products in aggregate totaling $350,000. It is unlikely that any of these milestones will be triggered in the next twelve months. In addition to the milestone payments, we will owe a royalty on the net sales of the licensed products. The amount of the royalty depends upon who is selling the product. Should we commercialize a product ourselves there is a running royalty obligation in the low single digit range based upon net sales. If a product is commercialized by another company under a sublicense agreement with us, then UT receives a share of consideration received by us that is in the low double-digit range. There is a minimum annual royalty payment obligation. We are responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents at our expense and for the prosecution and control of any action for infringement related to any product that does, or may, compete with one of our marketed licensed products and any claim within a licensed patent that covers or relates to such marketed licensed product.
International License Agreement with Lee’s
 
On March 12, 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, Zhaoke Pharmaceutical (HEFEI) Co. Ltd and Lee’s Pharmaceutical (Guangzhou) Limited (collectively, “Lee’s”) granting Lee’s exclusive rights to develop Vazalore in the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macao special Administrative Regions (the “Lee’s Agreement”). The Lee’s Agreement was amended on December 31, 2013, amended and restated effective June 19, 2015, and subsequently terminated by mutual agreement of the parties thereto on October 31, 2017. The Lee’s Agreement was a sublicense of UT patents in-licensed pursuant to the UT License Agreement providing Lee’s access to these and the Company’s patents. As of October 31, 2017, the Company has received $400,000 in payments per the terms of the Lee’s Agreement.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, in the European Union, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Approval Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), implementing regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s cGLP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
Preclinical studies and submission of an IND
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess a product’s potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless during such 30-day period the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent (assent, if applicable) in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the clinical trial patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Marketing approval
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee, which is typically increased annually. Under the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of the FDA’s acceptance for filing of a standard non-priority NDA to review and act on the submission.
 
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee, which is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, which is not under the control of the product sponsor. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
 12


Post-approval requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies to determine compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend significant time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although doctors may prescribe drugs for off-label purposes. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on FDA’s prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a similar product or published literature in support of its application.
 
 13


505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Hatch-Waxman exclusivity
 
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity (“NCE”) if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the NCE exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement (a Paragraph IV certification). If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
NDA vs. OTC Monograph products
 
OTC drugs can be brought to market via two routes: the NDA approval process and the OTC monograph process. A drug product is eligible to be brought to market via the OTC monograph process if it is not a new drug, and the drug product meets the FDA’s established conditions for general recognition of safety and effectiveness (“GRASE”). The OTC drug monographs are a kind of “rule book” of conditions for each therapeutic category covering acceptable ingredients, uses (indications), doses, formulations, labeling, and testing.
 
The OTC Drug Review is a three-phase public rulemaking process established by the FDA to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products marketed in the United States prior to May 11, 1972. The three-phase rulemaking process can be summarized as follows:
 

1) Advisory Review Panel — Advisory review panel appointed by the FDA analyzes data available on OTC drug active ingredients to determine if the active ingredients can be classified as GRASE, not GRASE, or insufficient data are available. Results of the advisory review panel’s analyses are published in the Federal Register as an Advance Notice for Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Tentative Final Monograph — After the FDA reviews the advisory review panel’s findings, as well as additional data that may have become available and the public’s comments, the FDA publishes its conclusions in the Federal Register as a Proposed Rule also called a Tentative Final Monograph (“TFM”). 


3) Final Monograph — After publication of the TFM, a period of time is allotted for interested parties to submit comments or data in response to the FDA’s proposal. The final regulations in the form of drug monographs provide a standard for GRASE OTC drug products.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 14


If a product deviates from the conditions under the TFM or final monograph and was not marketed before May 1972, then the drug product is considered a new drug and requires an NDA to be legally marketed. Aspirin was classified into the therapeutic class for Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Drug Products (“IAAA”). The ANPR was published in 1977, and in 1988, the FDA published the TFM for IAAA. The IAAA TFM recommends appropriate labeling, including therapeutic indications, dosage instructions, and warnings about side effects and ways of preventing misuse. Although it has been updated and amended since its original publication, the IAAA monograph has not been finalized.
 
Differences between the NDA approval process and the OTC monograph process are listed below.
 

NDA Approval Process | OTC Monograph Process 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-market approval — FDA review and approves formulation and labeling prior to marketing. | No pre-market approval — FDA sets forth specific conditions for GRASE, or in the case of a developing monograph, sets forth conditions that allow for continued marketing pending a final monograph.
Confidential filing | Public process 
Drug-product specific | Active ingredient-specific and evaluated by OTC drug category 
May require a user fee | No user fees 
Potential for marketing exclusivity | No marketing exclusivity 
FDA review timelines | Manufacturers responsible for ensuring compliant product with no FDA-mandated review (either pre- or post-market) 
May require clinical studies, including studies on label comprehension and actual use | Generally does not require clinical studies. Label comprehension and actual use studies are not required for ingredients already covered by a final or tentative final monograph. 
Approved labeling is unique to the drug | Labeling is defined by the monograph. Once marketed, FDA can review the complete labeling at any time to determine whether it is truthful or misleading. 
Approved NDA is “license” to market | Final monograph is open to anyone 
Trade name reviewed prior to marketing | No review of trade name prior to marketing. Once marketed, FDA can review the trade name at any time. 

 

When Vazalore 325 mg is commercialized, we believe it will be the only NDA-approved OTC aspirin product available. Approval of the Vazalore NDA granted Vazalore labeling similar to that of monograph aspirin products.
 
Professional Labeling
 
Although the IAAA TFM has not been finalized for OTC use, final regulations for the professional labeling of aspirin were published in 1988. Professional labeling is labeling that provides specific information to health professionals for uses not included in OTC drug labeling. Professional labeling can be provided solely to healthcare professionals. Professional labeling may not be used on consumer products or on consumer-directed labeling. Under the IAAA regulations for professional labeling of aspirin, patients can only use aspirin for cardiovascular-related uses when directed to do so by a physician.
 
Professional labeling for aspirin includes the following indications:
 

● | Vascular Indications (Ischemic Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), Acute Myocardial Infarction (“MI”), Prevention of Recurrent MI, Unstable Angina Pectoris, and Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris): Aspirin is indicated to: (1) reduce the combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli, (2) reduce the risk of vascular mortality in patients with a suspected acute MI, (3) reduce the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients with a previous MI or unstable angina pectoris, and (4) reduce the combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 15



● | Revascularization Procedures (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (“CABG”), Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (“PTCA”), and Carotid Endarterectomy): Aspirin is indicated in patients who have undergone revascularization procedures (i.e., CABG, PTCA, or carotid endarterectomy) when there is a preexisting condition for which aspirin is already indicated.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rheumatologic Disease Indications (Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, Spondyloarthropathies, Osteoarthritis, and the Arthritis and Pleurisy of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (“SLE”)): Aspirin is indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, spondyloarthropathies, and arthritis and pleurisy associated with SLE.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FDA Oversight vs. FTC Oversight
 
Since 1971, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) have had a Memorandum of Understanding in place, which dictates that the FDA has primary responsibility over OTC drug labeling, while the FTC has primary responsibility over OTC drug advertising.
 

 | Rx | OTC 
------------+----------+---------
Products | Products | Products
Labeling | FDA | FDA 
Advertising | FDA | FTC 

 

For an NDA-approved product, OTC labeling, including the labeling on the box, must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval prior to distribution. As indicated above, this is different from monograph products, which are not subjected to the FDA’s labeling review and approval processes prior to launching to market. Advertising for OTC products is under the purview of the FTC. Promotional material (including print, radio, and/or TV) is not required to be submitted to the FTC prior to distribution, unlike Rx promotional materials submitted to the FDA.
 
Under FTC regulations, claims in advertisements, including OTC medicine advertisements, must be truthful and cannot be misleading or unfair.
 
Advertisers must have substantiation that all objective express and implied claims in advertising are true before making the claims. The standard for substantiation of health claims is “competent and reliable scientific evidence.” For drug claims, competent and reliable scientific evidence generally has been interpreted as requiring at least one or two adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies of the product, or of an essentially equivalent product, that conform to acceptable designs and protocols and whose results, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, are sufficient to substantiate that the representation is true.
 
Beyond FTC regulation of advertising, industry self-regulation plays an important role. The National Advertising Division (“NAD”) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus reviews advertising complaints by competitors. NAD generally applies the same standard as the FTC. If NAD determines that the substantiation does not support the claims or that it is otherwise false and misleading, it will recommend that the advertiser revise or discontinue the advertisement. If the advertiser does not agree to do so, NAD will forward the case to the FTC or the FDA for review.
 
Foreign Regulatory Approval Process
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
 16


Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, we must obtain approval from both the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, and a favorable opinion from the competent ethics committee. Our clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”) established at the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP also is responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is requested by the CHMP but has not yet been provided. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not previously received marketing approval in any European Union member state. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
 
 17


In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our drug product candidates and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we collectively refer to as the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), contains provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare financing, including impacting the profitability of drugs. For example, the ACA revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Healthcare Law and Regulation
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our products that obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties law impose penalties and provide for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without written authorization;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business operations, including our sales or marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by governmental third-party payors, and in some instances, also such claims reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the Company, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 
 19


As we pursue international licensing and sales arrangements outside the United States, we will be heavily regulated and expect to have significant interaction with foreign officials. Additionally, in many countries outside the United States, the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers would be subject to regulation under the FCPA.
 
In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years, several jurisdictions, including China, Brazil, and the United Kingdom, have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area, increased their enforcement activities, and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 15 employees, of which 12 are full time employees. Of these full-time employees, three work on research and development, manufacturing, and clinical operations and nine work in sales, marketing, management and administration. We also use the services of numerous outside consultants in business and scientific matters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 
Our third-party manufacturers’ activities and our own activities may involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our pharmaceutical product candidates, test samples and reagents, biological materials and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and/or interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.
