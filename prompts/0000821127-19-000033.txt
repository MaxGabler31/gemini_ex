The quarterly earnings release conference call can also be accessed from the Company’s website. Press releases are also maintained on the Company’s website for one year. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this document and should not be considered part of this Report.
II.Asset Sales and Divestitures
On December 3, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, LLC (“BOS”) to the management team of BOS for an upfront cash payment and an eight year revenue sharing agreement with BOS. The present value of the estimated proceeds from the revenue sharing agreement was included in the gain on sale of BOS in the fourth quarter of 2018. Changes to the amount of actual proceeds from the revenue sharing agreement will result in future positive or negative revenue adjustments.
On April 13, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Anchor Capital Advisors LLC (“Anchor”) to the management team of Anchor for an upfront cash payment and future payments that had a net present value of $15.4 million at the time of closing.
In November 2016, the Bank sold two of its Southern California offices, one located in Granada Hills, CA and the other located in Burbank, CA, together with approximately $104 million of deposits.
In October 2014, Boston Private Bank acquired Banyan Partners, LLC ("Banyan"). Banyan and the wealth management operations from Boston Private Bank were combined to form Boston Private Wealth.

For further details relating to the Company’s divestitures, see Part II. Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Asset Sales and Divestitures.”
III.    Competition
The Company operates in the highly competitive financial services marketplace. The Bank encounters competition from larger national and regional commercial banking organizations, savings banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions and non-bank financial service companies, which may offer lower interest rates on loans and higher interest rates on deposits. The Bank’s competitors also include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for Bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. To compete effectively, the Bank relies on personal contacts by officers, directors, and employees, customized service, and the Bank’s reputation within the communities that it serves.
The RIAs compete with a wide variety of firms, including national and regional financial services firms, commercial banks and trust companies, mutual fund companies, investment advisory firms, stock brokerage firms, accounting firms, law firms, and digital advice platforms, which may offer lower fee services. Investment advisers that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us, which could have a material impact on our business. The Company and the Bank believe that their subsidiaries’ ability to compete is dependent upon the subsidiaries’ respective quality and level of service, personal relationships, the marketing and distribution of investment products, and investment performance. 
IV.    Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Company had 774 employees. The Company’s employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes its employee relations are good.
V. Supervision and Regulation 
The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect the safety and soundness of depository institutions, the federal deposit insurance system, and depositors, rather than the shareholders of a bank holding company such as the Company. 
 2

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the BHCA. The Company is also subject to supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”) under Massachusetts law. As a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and Federal Reserve member bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s California offices are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the California Department of Business Oversight Division of Financial Institutions (the “DFI”). 
The RIAs are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and state securities regulators.
The following is a summary of certain aspects of the various statutes and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and is qualified by reference to the full text of statutes and regulations referenced below.
Regulation of the Company
The Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, which has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices; to assess civil money penalties; and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
Source of Strength. Under the BHCA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide support to the Bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 
Acquisitions and Activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank; acquiring control of a bank; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company; or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. 
The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks. 
Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company. 
In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company; controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company; or the Federal Reserve has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company.

Regulation of the Bank
The Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve, and with respect to its California offices, the DFI. The Bank is also subject to regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), as enforced by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may also directly examine the other subsidiaries of the Company. The enforcement powers available to federal and state banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders, to terminate insurance of deposits, to assess civil money penalties, to issue directives to increase capital, to place the bank into receivership, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. 
Deposit Insurance. Deposit obligations of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor for deposits held in the same right and capacity. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to take steps as may be necessary to cause the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits - the designated reserve ratio - to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and it mandates that the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC for any year thereafter may not be less than 1.35%. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act required that, in setting assessments, the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on banks with less than $10 billion in assets. To satisfy these requirements, in 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The final rule imposes on large banks a surcharge of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. Large banks, which are generally banks with $10 billion or more in assets, will pay quarterly surcharges in addition to their regular risk-based assessments. Overall regular risk-based assessment rates will decline once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%. Small banks, such as the Bank, will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. After the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small bank’s credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment for each period when the ratio is at or above 1.38%. In January 2019, the Bank received notification from the FDIC that it will be eligible for small bank assessment credits of $2.0 million because the DIF ratio reached 1.36% in September 2018. The FDIC will apply the credits to banks' quarterly insurance assessment when the DIF fund is at or above 1.38%. The DIF reserve ratio was 1.36% as of December 31, 2018 therefore the Bank will not receive a credit for their fourth quarter 2018 assessment. The FDIC is planning to announce the March 31, 2019 ratio in May 2019 therefore the Bank will not know whether it will receive a credit for their first quarter 2019 assessment until the second quarter of 2019.
Deposit premiums are based on assets. To determine its deposit insurance premium, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate. In 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. Under this method, each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS composite ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets, and considerations related to asset quality. Under the small bank pricing rule, where the DIF’s reserve ratio has reached 1.15%, assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 will range from 1.5 to 16 basis points after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small institutions with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 or 5 may range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustment. Assessments for established banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 will range from 3 to 30 basis points. For 2018, the FDIC insurance expense for the Bank was $2.9 million. 
The FDIC has the authority to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. In addition, under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
Acquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve is required in order for the Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, to establish new branch offices on an interstate basis to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branch offices.

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Section 24 of the FDIA generally limits the types of equity investments that FDIC-insured state-chartered member banks, such as the Bank, may make and the kinds of activities in which such banks may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) permits state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage - through “financial subsidiaries” - in certain activities which are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a financial subsidiary, a state-chartered bank must be well capitalized, and must comply with certain capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Act provides that state member banks are subject to the same restrictions with respect to purchasing, selling, underwriting, and holding of investment securities as national banks.
Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and persons or companies that own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of securities of a bank or an affiliate of a bank, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly provides that an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that asset sale transactions with insiders must be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank, approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Bank. 
Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits. Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Growth Act”), which was enacted on May 24, 2018, amends Section 29 of the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions. Specifically, the Growth Act provides that reciprocal deposits received by an agent depository institution that places deposits (other than those obtained by or through a deposit broker) with a deposit placement network are not considered to be funds obtained by or through a deposit broker to the extent the total amount of such reciprocal deposits does not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of the depository institution’s total liabilities. However, a depository institution that is less than well capitalized may not accept or roll over such excluded reciprocal deposits at a rate of interest that is significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its market area or a national rate cap established by the FDIC.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the Federal Reserve to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The Federal Reserve’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branch offices, ATMs, and other offices. The Bank’s most recent performance evaluation from the Federal Reserve was a “satisfactory” rating. Massachusetts has also enacted a similar statute that requires the Commissioner to evaluate the performance of the Bank in helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community and to take that record into account in considering certain applications.
Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet. The Federal Reserve may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
The capital adequacy guidelines define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes 
 5

common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 capital, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus, and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital. Prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies were permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier 1 capital, subject to limitations. However, the Federal Reserve’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathered non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. In addition, under rules that became effective January 1, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier 1 capital; however, the Company and the Bank were permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company and the Bank have made this election.
Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average assets less certain items such as goodwill and intangible assets, as permitted under the capital rules.
Under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions of more than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The capital conservation buffer has been fully phased in on January 1, 2019. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s rules, a Federal Reserve supervised institution, such as the Bank, is considered well capitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. The Bank is currently considered well capitalized under all regulatory definitions.
Generally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA that, for example, (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that its federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.
Current capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
Section 201 of the Growth Act directs the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible capital to average total consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%. The legislation provides that a qualifying community bank, which the legislation defines as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, that exceeds the community bank leverage ratio shall be considered to have met the generally applicable leverage capital requirements and the generally applicable risk-based capital 
 6

requirements. In addition, a depository institution that exceeds the community bank leverage ratio will be regarded as having met the capital ratio requirements that are required in order to be considered well capitalized under Section 38 of the FDIA. The federal banking agencies may exclude institutions from availing themselves of this relief based on the institution’s risk profile, taking into account off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, total notional derivatives exposures, and such other factors as the federal banking agencies determine appropriate. The federal banking agencies have proposed a community bank leverage ratio of 9%, which means that qualifying institutions with a community bank leverage ratio exceeding 9% would be eligible for the relief provided by Section 201 of the Growth Act. The federal banking agencies have also proposed excluding from this relief institutions with levels of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and deferred tax assets exceeding certain levels as well as all advanced approaches banking organizations.
Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “-Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 
Dividend Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The revenue of the Company (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from dividends paid to it by the Bank and the Company’s other subsidiaries. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries through the payment of dividends or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiaries, including, with respect to the Bank, depositors of the Bank, except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain capital above the capital conservation buffer. See “-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness -Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
Restrictions on Bank Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. In addition, a state bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank’s net income (as reportable in its Reports of Condition and Income) during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve. A state member bank may not declare and pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits (as reportable on its Reports of Condition and Income) unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve. The payment of dividends by a bank is also restricted pursuant to various state regulatory limitations.

Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates
There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of affiliate to include an investment fund for which the depository institution or one of its affiliates is an investment adviser. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution; and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the Federal Reserve; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be on market terms and not otherwise unduly favorable to the holding company or an affiliate of the holding company. Moreover, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any service.
Consumer Protection Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Ownership Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), the GLBA, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with clients when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The Federal Reserve examines the Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforces CFPB rules with respect to the Bank
Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan, and allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of TILA as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement, for negative amortization loans, and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. The Growth Act included provisions that ease certain requirements related to mortgage transactions for certain small institutions, which are generally those with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. 
Privacy and Customer Information Security. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the Bank must provide its clients with an initial and annual disclosure that explains its policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information unless otherwise provided in such policies and procedures. However, an annual disclosure is not required to be provided by a financial institution if the financial institution only discloses information under exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt out to be provided and if there has been no change in its privacy policies and practices since its most recent disclosure provided to consumers. The GLBA also requires that the Bank develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of client information (as defined under GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or

integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any client. The Bank is also required to send a notice to clients whose “sensitive information” has been compromised if unauthorized use of the information is “reasonably possible.” Most states, including the states in which the Bank operates, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and the duties of the Bank in response to a data breach. In addition, Massachusetts has promulgated data security regulations with respect to personal information of Massachusetts residents. Pursuant to the FACT Act, the Bank has developed and implemented a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations. 
Anti-Money Laundering 
The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of transactions that involve at least $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application under Section 3 of the BHCA to acquire a bank or an application under the Bank Merger Act to merge banks or affect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target. In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to take steps to monitor their correspondent banking and private banking relationships as well as, if applicable, their relationships with “shell banks.” 
OFAC. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country, or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on certain transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, setoff or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.
Regulation of Other Activities 
Registered Investment Advisers; ERISA. Certain subsidiaries of the Company and the Bank are registered with the SEC as RIAs under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary, recordkeeping, operational, and disclosure obligations. RIAs are also subject to regulation under the securities laws and fiduciary laws of certain states.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to study the standard of care for brokers and investment advisers and report its findings to Congress. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act permits the SEC to impose a uniform standard of care on brokers and investment advisers based on the study’s findings. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC must also harmonize the enforcement of fiduciary standard violations under the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act. It is unclear how the studies and rulemaking relating to the fiduciary duties of brokers and investment advisers will affect the Company and its RIAs.
Each of the mutual funds for which DGHM acts as sub-adviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Shares of each such fund are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act, and the shares of each fund are qualified for sale (or exempt from such qualification) under the laws of each state and the District of Columbia to the extent such shares are sold in any of such jurisdictions.

As a sub-adviser to registered investment companies, DGHM is subject to requirements under the 1940 Act and related SEC regulations. Under provisions of the 1940 Act and Advisers Act governing advisory contracts, an assignment terminating a company’s sub-advisory contract can occur as a result of the acquisition of that company by another company.
The Company, the Bank, and their subsidiaries are also subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. 
The foregoing laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict certain subsidiaries of the Company from conducting their business in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed in the event of such noncompliance include the suspension of individual employees; limitations on the business activities for specified periods of time; revocation of registration as an investment adviser, commodity trading adviser and/or other registrations; and other censures and fines. 
Volcker Rule Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Sponsorship of Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain circumstances, pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” Under the Dodd-Frank Act, proprietary trading generally means trading by a banking entity or its affiliate for its trading account. Hedge funds and private equity funds are described by the Dodd-Frank Act as funds that would be registered under the 1940 Act but for certain enumerated exemptions. Section 203 of the Growth Act includes a provision that excludes a banking organization from application of the Volcker Rule if the organization does not have and is not controlled by a company that has (i) more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and (ii) total trading assets and trading liabilities exceeding 5% of total consolidated assets.
VI.Taxation
Federal Taxation
The Company and its incorporated affiliates are subject to federal income taxation generally applicable to corporations under the Code. In addition, the Bank is subject to Subchapter H of the Code, which provides specific rules for the treatment of securities, reserves for loan losses, and any common trust funds. 
The Company and its incorporated affiliates are members of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code and file a consolidated federal income tax return. Some of the advantages of filing a consolidated tax return include the avoidance of tax on intercompany distributions and the ability to offset operating and capital losses of one company against operating income and capital gains of another company. 
The Company’s taxable income includes its share of the taxable income or loss from its subsidiaries that are limited liability companies.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated the exemption for performance-based executive compensation. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts of any new guidance released that provides further clarification of the Tax Act.
State and Local Taxation
The Company and its affiliates are subject to the tax rate established in the states and certain municipalities in which they do business. Substantially all of the Company’s taxable state and local income is derived from Massachusetts, California, Florida, New York, and the City of New York. 
The Massachusetts tax rate is 9.0% on taxable income apportioned to Massachusetts. Massachusetts’ taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include a deduction for 95% of dividends received from entities in which the Company owns 15% or more of the voting stock, income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations. 
The California tax rate is 8.84% for corporations that are not financial institutions and 10.84% for financial institutions. The California tax is on California taxable income, which is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
 10

The Florida tax rate is 5.5% on taxable income apportioned to Florida. Florida’s taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The New York state tax rate is 6.5% on taxable income apportioned to New York (subject to alternative minimum taxes that may be based on business capital or a fixed dollar minimum), plus a surcharge for business operations in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation district. New York taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The New York City tax rate is 8.85% on taxable income apportioned to New York City (subject to alternative minimum taxes that may be based on business capital or a fixed dollar minimum). New York City taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
