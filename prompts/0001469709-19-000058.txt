Item 1. Business.

West Coast Ventures Group Corp. (WCVC, the Company, our, us or we) was originally incorporated as Energizer Tennis Corp. on June 16, 2011 in the state of Nevada. WCVC entered into a reverse acquisition transaction whereby WCVC acquired Nixon Restaurant Group, Inc. (NRG) on October 4, 2017, which was effective January 1, 2017 for accounting purposes. 

NRG was formed on October 12, 2015 in the state of Florida. On October 19, 2015, NRG acquired 100% ownership in J&F Restaurants, LLC, Illegal Burger, LLC, and Illegal Burger Writer Square LLC, all Colorado limited liability companies under common ownership (the Acquired Entities), in exchange for 20 million shares of NRG. The Acquired Entities accounted for the transaction as a corporate reorganization. Illegal Burger restaurants have a full menu offering unique burgers that are made with never-frozen, hormone free beef, traditional sides like french fries and tater tots, and alcoholic beverages, including liquor.

Since WCVC acquired the Acquired Entities, it has been operating six restaurants in the greater Denver, Colorado metro area: (1) El Senor Sol, a Mexican cuisine restaurant in located in Evergreen, Colorado, which has been operating in excess of five years; (2) Illegal Burger, which opened in August 2013 and is located beside the El Senor Sol restaurant in Evergreen, Colorado; (3) Illegal Burger, located in Arvada, Colorado, which opened in April 2014; (4) Illegal Burger, located in downtown Denver, Colorado, which opened in January 2016, (5) Illegal Burger, located in the Capital Hill Neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, which opened in June 2016 and Illegal Burger, located in Glendale, Colorado which opened in October 2018.
