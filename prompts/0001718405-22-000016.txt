ITEM 1. BUSINESS
About the Company
Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (formerly known as Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 28, 2017. In this 2021 Form 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company”, “Hycroft”, and "HYMC" refer to Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries. We are a U.S.-based gold and silver development company that owns the Hycroft Mine in the prolific mining region of Northern Nevada. 
Our property, the Hycroft Mine, has historically operated as an open-pit oxide mining and heap leach processing operation and is located approximately 54 miles west of Winnemucca, Nevada. Mining operations at the Hycroft Mine were restarted in 2019 on a pre-commercial scale and discontinued in November 2021 as a result of the then current and expected ongoing cost pressures for many of the reagents and consumables used at the Hycroft Mine and the timeline for completing our updated technical studies in 2022 for optimal processing the plan forward. In February 2022, Hycroft, along with its third-party consultants, completed and filed an Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary for the Hycroft Mine (the "2022 Hycroft TRS") with an effective date of February 18, 2022 and prepared in accordance with the SEC Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants as set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K ("Modernization Rules"). The 2022 Hycroft TRS provides an Initial Assessment of the mineral resource estimate utilizing a milling and acid pressure oxidation ("Acid POX") process for sulfide mineralization and heap leaching process for oxide and transition mineralization. As a result of the milling and Acid POX process presented in the 2022 Hycroft TRS, as compared to the novel two-step oxidation and heap leap process presented in the Hycroft Technical Report Summary, Heap Leaching Feasibility Study, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Modernization Rules, with an effective date of July 31, 2019 (the “2019 Hycroft TRS”), and the associated fundamental changes to the assumptions underlying the 2019 Hycroft TRS also prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Modernization Rules, the 2022 Hycroft TRS supersedes and replaces the 2019 Hycroft TRS and the 2019 Hycroft TRS and information from such 2019 Hycroft TRS should no longer be relied upon. Our ongoing disclosures and many of management estimates and judgements will be based on the 2022 Hycroft TRS and not the 2019 Hycroft TRS. The Company 
will continue to build on the work to date and investigate opportunities identified through progressing the technical and data analyses leading up to the 2022 Hycroft TRS and will provide an updated technical report at an appropriate time. During the year ended December 31, 2021 we sold 56,045 ounces of gold and 397,546 ounces of silver. As of December 31, 2021, the Hycroft Mine had measured and indicated mineral resources of 9.6 million ounces of gold and 446.0 million ounces of silver and inferred mineral resources of 5.0 million ounces of gold and 150.4 million ounces of silver, which are contained in oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores. 
Our corporate headquarters is located at 4300 Water Canyon Road, Unit 1 Winnemucca, Nevada 89445, and our telephone number is (775) 304-0260. Our website is www.hycroftmining.com.
Recapitalization Transaction with MUDS
As discussed in Note 1 - Company Overview and Note 3 - Recapitalization Transaction to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 29, 2020, we, formerly known as Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation (“MUDS”), consummated a business combination transaction (the “Recapitalization Transaction”) that resulted in MUDS Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Acquisition Sub”) acquiring all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the direct subsidiaries of Hycroft Mining Corporation (“Seller”) and substantially all of the other assets of Seller and assuming substantially all of the liabilities of Seller. In conjunction with the Recapitalization Transaction, Seller’s indebtedness existing prior to the Recapitalization Transaction was either repaid, exchanged for indebtedness of the Company, exchanged for shares of common stock or converted into shares of Seller common stock, and our post-Recapitalization Transaction indebtedness included amounts drawn under the Credit Agreement among MUDS, MUDS Holdco Inc., Allied VGH LLC, Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC Sprott Private Resource Lending II (Collector) Inc., and Sprott Resources Lending Corp. (“Sprott Credit Agreement”) and the assumption of the newly issued Subordinated Notes (as such are defined herein). 
Segment Information
The Hycroft Mine is our only operating segment and includes the operations, development, and exploration activities and contains 100% of our revenues and production costs. Corporate and Other includes corporate general and administrative costs. See Note 19 - Segment Information to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments.
Principal Products, Revenues, and Market Overview
The principal products produced during 2021 and 2020 at the Hycroft Mine were unrefined gold and silver bars (doré) and gold and silver laden carbons and slags, both of which are sent to third party refineries and sold at prevailing spot prices after adjustments for refining and other associated fees, to financial institutions or precious metals traders. Doré bars and gold and silver laden carbons and slags are sent to refineries to produce bullion that meets the required market standards of 99.95% pure gold and 99.90% pure silver. Under the terms of our refining agreements, doré bars and gold and silver laden carbons and slags are refined for a fee, and our share of the separately recovered refined gold and refined silver are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers. 
Product Revenues and Customers
In 2021, revenues from gold and silver recovered from our pre-commercial scale heap leaching operations made up 91% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenue and, as such, we consider gold our principal product. In 2021, all of our revenues were derived from metal sales to two customers; however, we do not believe we have any dependencies on these customers due to the liquidity of the metal markets and the availability of other metal buyers and financial institutions.
Gold and Silver Uses
Gold and silver have two main categories of use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and coins. Fabricated silver also has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, mirrors, cameras, electronics, energy, engines, novelty explosives and coins. Gold and silver investors buy gold and silver bullion, coins and jewelry.
Gold and Silver Supply and Demand
The supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and metal recycling and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. Based on publicly available information, gold production from mines increased 2% in 2021 compared with 2020 totaling approximately 3,561 metric tons (or 114.5 million troy ounces) and represented approximately 76.3% of the 2021 global gold supply of 4,666 
metric tons. According to the World Gold Council, gold demand in 2021 was approximately 4,021 metric tons (or 129.3 million troy ounces) and totaled approximately $232.6 billion in value. In 2021, gold demand by sector was comprised of jewelry (54%), investments including bar and coin and ETFs (26%), central bank purchases (12%), and technology (8%).
The supply of silver consists of a combination of current production from mining (approximately 80%) and metal recycling and other (approximately 20%). Based on publicly available information, estimated silver production from mines increased approximately 8% in 2021 compared with 2020 totaling approximately 849 million troy ounces and represented approximately 80% of the estimated 2021 global silver supply of 1,056 million troy ounces. Estimated silver demand in 2021 was approximately 1,033 million troy ounces and totaled approximately $25.9 billion in value. In 2021, silver demand by sector was comprised of photovoltaics (10%), other industrial (41%), jewelry (18%), silverware (4%), photography (3%), and investments (24%).
Gold and Silver Prices 
The price of gold and silver is volatile and is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions, inflation or deflation and monetary policies, fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional demand, and the political and economic conditions of major gold and silver producing countries throughout the world. The following table presents the annual high, low, and average afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past three years on the London Bullion Market (in U.S. dollars per ounce).

 | GOLD PRICES | | SILVER PRICES
Year | High | | Low | Average | | High | Low | | Average
2019 | $ | 1,546 | | $ | 1,270 | | $ | 1,393 | | $ | 19.31 | $ | 14.38 | $ | 16.21
2020 | $ | 2,067 | | $ | 1,474 | | $ | 1,770 | | $ | 28.89 | $ | 12.01 | $ | 20.55
2021 | $ | 1,943 | | $ | 1,684 | | $ | 1,799 | | $ | 29.59 | $ | 21.53 | $ | 25.04
2022 (through March 29) | $ | 2,039 | | $ | 1,788 | | $ | 1,875 | | $ | 26.17 | $ | 22.24 | $ | 23.95

On March 29, 2022, the afternoon fixing price for gold and silver on the London Bullion Market was $1,937 per ounce and $25.62 per ounce, respectively.
Competition
The top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately one third of total worldwide mined gold production. We are a gold and silver development company with a single property. The Hycroft Mine has large gold and silver mineral resources included in the 2022 Hycroft TRS. We have not fully developed our operation and we have not established our long-term production and cost structure. Our costs are expected to be determined by the location, grade and nature of our ore body, processing technologies applied to our ore, and costs including energy, reagents, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long-term is based on our ability to develop and cost effectively operate the Hycroft Mine in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.
We compete with other mining companies in connection with hiring and retaining qualified employees. There is substantial competition for qualified employees in the mining industry, some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than us and a more stable history. As a result, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees.
Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Industry Related Risks — We face intense competition in the mining industry, for additional discussion related to our current and potential competition.
Employees
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 102 employees, of which 95 were employed at the Hycroft Mine. None of our employees are represented by unions.
COVID-19
We have implemented health and safety policies for employees, contractors, and visitors that follow guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). During 2021, our operations faced certain limitations due to COVID-19 related absences, however the impact, while negative, did not materially and adversely affect our operations.
Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Industry Related Risks — The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations as well as Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion related to COVID-19.
Government Regulation of Mining-Related Activities
Government Regulation 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our current mining, exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in Nevada and the United States. Although we are not aware of any current claims, orders or directions relating to our business with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations, changes to, or more stringent application, interpretation, or enforcement of, such laws and regulations in Nevada, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs, which could adversely impact the profitability levels of our projects.
Environmental Regulation 
Our mining projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The federal laws and regulations, among other things:
•impose strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act); 
•govern the generation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste (the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act);
•restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including mining and processing activities (the Clean Air Act);
•require federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, including the issuance of permits to mining facilities and assessing alternatives to these actions (the National Environmental Policy Act);
•regulate the use of federal public lands to prevent undue and unnecessary degradation of the public lands (the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976);
•restrict and control the discharge of pollutants and dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States (the Clean Water Act); and
•regulate the drilling of subsurface injection wells (the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Underground Injection Control Program promulgated thereunder). 
We cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, to federal laws or regulations may be adopted or imposed by the current governmental administration. At the state level, mining operations in Nevada are regulated by the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Protection (the "Division"), which has the authority to implement and enforce many of the federal regulatory programs described above as well as state environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals, delays in beginning or expanding operations, limitations on production levels, incurring additional costs for investigation or cleanup of hazardous substances, payment of fines, penalties or remediation costs for non-compliance, and post-mining closure, reclamation and bonding.
It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards our employees, public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are, and will be, conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, our past and future activities in the United States may cause us to be subject to liability under such laws and regulations. For information about the risks to our business related to environmental regulation, see the following risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Industry Related Risks:
•Our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require, or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed;
•Changes in environmental regulations could adversely affect our cost of operations or result in operations delays;
•Environmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability; and
•Our exploration and development operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays.
During 2021 and 2020, there were no known material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by us. We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2021 and 2020 and do not expect to incur any material expenditures in 2022 for such environmental control facilities.
Reclamation
We are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by amending, backfilling, stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing are completed, mitigating potential impacts to surface water and groundwater resources. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Our reclamation obligations at the Hycroft Mine are secured by surface management surety bonds that meet the financial assurance requirements of the State of Nevada and the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"). Our most recent reclamation cost estimate was approved by the BLM and the State of Nevada in July 2020. At December 31, 2021, our surface management surety bonds totaled $59.3 million, of which $58.3 million secures the financial assurance requirements for the Hycroft Mine, and $1.0 million secures the financial assurance requirements for the adjacent water supply well field and exploration project. Based on the December 31, 2021 estimate, no material reclamation expenditures are expected to be incurred until after mining and mineral processing are completed. If we incur additional long-term environmental impacts from future mining activities, we will likely have additional reclamation obligations as well as additional financial assurance requirements. For our existing obligations, as well as any future obligations we may incur we may choose to engage in reclamation activities before mining and mineral processing are completed, but these expenses are not anticipated to be material to the overall reclamation obligation. When we perform reclamation work in the future, the work will be planned to conform to our mining operations and will be required to be documented when completed under our governing permits with the government regulatory agencies. The reclamation obligation would be adjusted accordingly as allowed under current regulations, and the financial assurance requirements would be adjusted to account for the completed reclamation work. If we are required to comply with material unanticipated financial assurance requirements in the future, our financial position could be adversely affected, or our posted financial assurance may be insufficient. For financial information about our estimated future reclamation costs refer to Note 13 - Asset Retirement Obligation to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Mine Safety and Health Administration Regulations
Safety and health is a core value which is why we have mandatory mine safety and health programs that include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. We consider these programs to be essential at all levels to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors only operate in a safe and healthy workplace. 
Our operations and exploration properties are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), issuers are required to disclose specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities in periodic reports. MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. The number of citations and orders charged against mining operations in the U.S., and the dollar penalties assessed for such citations, have generally increased in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Act requires us to provide a mine safety disclosure, which we have done in Part I - Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures of this 2021 Form 10-K.
Property Interests and Mining Claims
Our development activities are conducted in the State of Nevada. Mineral interests in Nevada may be owned by the United States, the State of Nevada, or private parties. Where prospective mineral properties are held by the United States, mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land. Where prospective mineral properties are owned by the State of Nevada or private parties, some type of property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for us to explore or develop such property. Mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests. Additionally, mining claims are self-initiated and self-maintained and, therefore, possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests. It is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and, therefore, it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim. For general information about our mineral properties and mining claims refer to Item 2. Properties. For information about the risks to our business related to our property interests and mining claims, see the following risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Industry Related Risks:
•There are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations; and
•Legislation has been proposed periodically that could, if enacted, significantly affect the cost of our operations on our unpatented mining claims or the amount of Net Proceeds Mineral Tax we pay to the State of Nevada.
Technical Report Summaries ("TRS") and Qualified Persons
The scientific and technical information concerning our mineral projects in this 2021 Form 10-K have been reviewed and approved by third-party “qualified persons” under the Modernization Rules, including Ausenco Engineering USA South Inc., Independent Mining Consultants, Inc, and WestLand Engineering & Environmental Services, Inc. For a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral resources included in this 2021 Form 10-K, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant factors, please review the 2022 Hycroft TRS.
