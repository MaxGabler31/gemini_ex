Currently, the Company has five (5) subsidiary holdings. Sun Pacific Power Corp., which was the initial company that specialized in solar, electrical and general construction. Bella Electric, LLC that in conjunction with the Company operated our electrical contracting work. Bella Electric, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited liability company. The Company also formed Sun Pacific Security Corp., a New Jersey corporation. Bella Electric, LLC and Sun Pacific Security Corp. have generally ceased operations and we are in the process of dissolving both legal entities. The Company also formed National Mechanical Group Corp, a New Jersey corporation focused on holding the Company’s patents. The Company also formed Street Smart Outdoor Corp, a Wyoming corporation that acts as a holding company for the Company’s state specific operations in unique advertising through solar bus stops, solar trashcans and “street kiosks.” MedRecycler, LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary duly formed in the state of Nevada.

As of today, our principal source of revenues is derived from Street Smart Outdoor Corp. operations in the outdoor advertising business with contracts in place in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Tallahassee, Florida, along with some other minor contracting work that we are currently reviewing to determine if we shall continue pursuing in the future.
 
On September 19, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published patent US 2019 288 139 A1 for the Frame-Less Encapsulated Photo-Voltaic (PV) Solar Power Panel Supporting Solar Cell Modules Encapsulated Within Optically-Transparent Epoxy-Resin Material Coating a Phenolic Resin Support Sheet issued to National Mechanical Group Corp. Originally designed for application in the solar bus shelters operated by Street Smart Outdoor Corp, as a glassless solar panel, the Company has developed a patent protected product and process for creating solar panels that can be integrated directly into the design of products as a molded, weather resistant plastic. The Company began work developing a business plan for expanding on either manufacturing or licensing of the technology in 2020, with such work continuing into 2022, given limit capital resources at this time.
 
Currently, the Company has been and is insolvent if you factor in the Company’s debt obligations. Over its history and to augment the Company’s strategy, it has sought out partnerships and other arrangements with professionals and companies at the operating subsidiary level to counter its insolvent state, coupled with the Company’s use of debt and equity financings. The Company continues to look for opportunities that will allow it to partner with others in the form of debt and or equity and other contributions at the subsidiary level, and where possible attempt to keep control of at least fifty one percent (51%) of those subsidiaries. While it will also look for the means to correct its insolvent state at the holding company level, given its current negative economic condition, many parties continue to prefer to work with the Company at an operational subsidiary level. The Company is currently exploring other equity and or debt opportunities to correct its overall insolvent state. Although we continue operations through our subsidiary holdings, revenues generated do not fully produce cash flows sufficient to meet our basic capital requirements. In order to meet our reporting requirements, we may have to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing and/or request deferred payment or other in-kind payments for services. Street Smart Outdoor is undercapitalized making expansion of our advertising products highly unlikely or difficult to expand without the use of potential partnerships and or commission only sales representatives. Neither the Company nor Street Smart Outdoor have secured additional financing to support operations. We are attempting to partner or otherwise develop a capital strategy to allow us to grow the outdoor advertising business that includes financing outdoor structures with other parties, in which we arrange financing arrangements, and we continue to look for other professional organizations that we can partner with in expanding our contracts.
 
Strategic Vision 
 
Our objective is to grow our business profitably as a premier green energy-based provider of both product and services to the public and private sectors. We are working to deploy our strategy in building upon our general and other contracting expertise in conjunction with our intellectual property and subject matter expertise in green energy that may allow us to grow a group of profitable business lines in solar, waste to energy, efficient lighting, and other unique energy related areas.
 
Recent advances in a multitude of different yet converging technologies have significantly improved the ability to integrate energy efficient products and solutions into infrastructure related projects. These technological advances decrease the requirements needed to jointly operate a multitude of differing assets, devices, and tools that create new ways to integrate evolving new technologies. This technological change and convergence in energy efficient devices, integrated communications among devices, and societal needs to more effectively and environmentally friendly we believe presents a significant opportunity for us in providing and supporting simple to complex integrated solutions.
 
Our challenges continue to be reaching critical mass in our solar shelter business, expanding into other green energy related projects, completion of the Rhode Island Project and securing operational capital. While the Company has never been adequately funded from inception, the Company has attempted to use debt, equity, and other opportunistic in-kind compensation to further the Company’s strategic vision.

Going Concern 
 
The Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $7.8 million and a working capital deficit of approximately $2.9 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and/or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties.
 
In order to further implement its business plan and satisfy its working capital requirements, the Company will need to raise additional capital. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, if at all.
 
There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Competition 
 
Our competitive market is made up of a variety of small to large company’s depending upon the area that we are competing within. In the Contracting marketplace they range from a large number of small to large organizations, while in the solar and advertising shelter marketplace it is made up of a smaller amount of direct competitors including JC DeCaoux, Lamar, Clear Chanel, Signal Outdoor, and various others. While the Contractor marketplace we believe is not subject to rapid technological change driven in part by periodic introductions of new technologies we believe the Shelter marketplace and the new areas in other green energy marketplace may be subject to more technological change. Given this we believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance, price of services, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with domain expertise.
Marketing and Sales 
 
We currently engage in a limited amount of marketing activities related to request for proposals for projects related to government contracts and or other contracting activities with commercial and private entities. We are developing a variety of new marketing activities designed to broaden our market awareness of our products, services and solutions, that may include e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage developing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We plan to participate in and sponsor conferences that cater to our target market and demonstrate and promote our products, services and solutions at trade shows targeted to green energy companies and executives. We also plan to publish white papers relating to green energy projects and develop customer reference programs, such as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address many of the benefits of our solutions.
 
Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our products, services, and solutions in our target markets and to generate qualified sales leads that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision makers. We plan to use partnerships and other business arrangements to augment our marketing and sales reach in both our outdoor advertising, construction, and waste to energy business.
 
Clients 
 
Our client base is located predominantly in the Northeast region of the U.S. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of contracts. Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts, which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of our customer contracts and seeking out partnerships that will allow us to increase our customer reach beyond our limited reach.

Intellectual Property 
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We will protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology.
 
U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
 
On September 19, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published patent US 2019 288 139 A1 for the Frame-Less Encapsulated Photo-Voltaic (PV) Solar Power Panel Supporting Solar Cell Modules Encapsulated Within Optically-Transparent Epoxy-Resin Material Coating a Phenolic Resin Support Sheet issued to National Mechanical Group Corp. Originally designed for application in the solar bus shelters operated by Street Smart Outdoor Corp, as a glassless solar panel, the Company has developed a patent protected product and process for creating solar panels that can be integrated directly into the design of products as a molded, weather resistant plastic. The Company has started work developing a business plan for expanding on either manufacturing or licensing of the technology in 2020 but given capital limitations continues this development in 2022.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of government agencies awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2 full-time employees. We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary or full-time employees as needed. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. The primary method of soliciting personnel is through recruiting resources directly utilizing all known sources including electronic databases, public forums, and personal networks of friends and former co-workers.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to offer market competitive compensation packages to attract and retain highly skilled, highly motivated and disciplined managerial, technical, sales and support personnel. We generally do not have employment contracts with our employees, but we do selectively maintain employment agreements with key employees. In addition, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements are in place with many of our customer, employees and consultants and such agreements are included our policies and procedures. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
