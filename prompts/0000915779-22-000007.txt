Industry Background
Over the years, our products have evolved significantly from scoreboards and matrix displays with related software applications to complex, integrated visual display systems which include full color video with text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network that are tied together through sophisticated control systems. In the mid-1990's, as light emitting diodes (“LEDs”) became available in red, blue and green colors with outdoor brightness, we pioneered the development of full color LED video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors, thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color, brightness, energy efficiency and lifetime. Due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems, we were able to add video capabilities so we could meet all our customers' large format display needs in a complete, integrated system. This has proven to be a key factor in Daktronics becoming a leader in large electronic displays. LED technologies continue to evolve and advance, creating new high-resolution and micro-LED display options of all shapes and sizes. Today, the industry continues development in both the construct of the micro-LED and production methods of micro-LED display panels using mass-transfer technology.
Integrated visual display systems are increasingly used across a variety of vertical markets including: media/advertising, stadiums/venues, hospitality/leisure, transportation, military and government, broadcast, control room, corporate and education, and retail. Generally, these vertical markets use systems to collaboratively communicate, inform, entertain, and advertise to various sized audiences. Advances in technologies and the decrease in costs of systems have opened up and increased the market's size.
Description of Business
We are engaged in a full range of activities: marketing and sales, engineering and product design and development, manufacturing, technical contracting, professional services and customer service and support. Each of those activities is described below:
Marketing and Sales. Our sales force is comprised of direct sales staff and resellers located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service. We primarily use a direct sales force for large integrated display system sales in professional sports, colleges and universities, and commercial spectacular projects. We also use our direct sales force to sell third-party advertising and transportation applications. We utilize resellers outside North America for large integrated system sales where we do not have a direct sales presence. The majority of our products sold by resellers in North America are standard catalog products. We support our resellers through direct mail/email advertising, social media campaigns, trade journal advertising, product and installation training, trade show exhibitions and accessibility to our regional sales or service teams and demonstration equipment.
Engineering and Product Design and Development. The large format electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services. To remain competitive, we have a tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to anticipate and respond rapidly to the system needs in the marketplace. We employ and contract with engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design; applications engineering; software design; quality design; and customer and product support. Product managers assigned to each product family assist our sales staff in training and implementing product improvements which ensures each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability. We employ and contract with process engineers to assist in quality and reliability processing in our product design testing and manufacturing areas. We also make selected investments in and contract with affiliated companies to support and advance technologies and capabilities for our product lines and solutions.
Manufacturing. The majority of our products are manufactured in the United States, specifically in South Dakota and Minnesota. We also have manufacturing facilities in China and Ireland. We perform component manufacturing, system manufacturing (metal fabrication, electronic assembly, sub-assembly and final assembly) and testing in-house for most of our products to control quality, improve response time and maximize cost-effectiveness. Given the cyclical nature of some parts of our business and dispersed sales geography, we balance and maintain our ability to manufacture the same products 
across our plants so we can efficiently utilize our capacity and reduce costs. A key strategy of ours is to increase standardization and commonality of parts and manufacturing processes across product lines through the use of product platforms to increase efficiencies. Other strategies include supplier management programs and lean manufacturing techniques. For more details on our facilities, see "Part II, Item 2. Properties".
Technical Contracting. We serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations requiring custom designs and innovative product solutions. The purchase of display systems typically involves competitive proposals. As part of our response to a proposal request, we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system. We usually include site preparation and installation services related to the display system in our proposal. In these cases, we serve as a contractor and may retain subcontractors for electrical, steel and installation labor. We have developed relationships with many subcontractors throughout the United States and the world, which is an advantage for us in bidding and delivering on these projects. We are licensed as a general contractor in many jurisdictions.
Professional Services. To assist our clients' ability to engage, inform and entertain their audiences, we provide professional services including event support, content creation, product maintenance, marketing assistance, training on hardware and software, control room design, and continuing technical support training for operators.
Customer Service and Support. We offer limited warranties on our products, ranging from one to 10 years, against failure due to defective parts or workmanship. In addition, we offer service agreements of various scopes. To serve our customers, we provide help-desk access, parts repair and replacement, display monitoring and on-site support. Our technical help desk has experienced technicians who are on-call 24 hours a day to support events and sites. Our field service personnel and third-party service partners are trained to provide on-site support. We use third-party service partners to allow us to respond to the changes in volume of service requests during our seasonal peaks.
Products and Technologies
The two principal components of our systems are the display and the controller, which manages the operation of the display. We produce displays varying in complexity, size and resolution. The physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area, the distance from the viewer to the display, and the amount and type of information to be displayed. The controller is comprised of computer hardware and software products designed to compile information provided by the operator and other integrated sources to display information, graphics or animation on the displays. We customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment in which our products function.
Our products are comprised of the following product families:
•Video displays/video walls
•Scoreboards and timing systems
•Message displays
•ITS (intelligent transportation systems) dynamic message signs
•Mass Transit displays
•Sound systems
•Digital billboards
•Digital street furniture
•Digit and price displays
•Indoor dynamic messaging systems and indoor liquid crystal display ("LCD") signs
•Software and controllers including Venus® Control Suite
Each of these product families is described below:
Video Displays/Video Walls. These displays are comprised of a large number of full-color pixels capable of showing various levels of video, graphics and animation. These displays include red, green and blue LEDs arranged in various combinations to form pixels. The electronic circuitry, which controls the pixels, allows for variances in the relative brightness of each LED to provide a full color spectrum, thereby displaying video images in striking, vibrant colors. Variables in video displays include the spacing of the pixels (pixel pitch), the resolution of the displays (number of pixels), the brightness of the displays (nits), the number of discrete colors the display is able to produce (color depth), the viewing angles, and the LED technology.
We offer a broad range of indoor and outdoor LED video displays with these varying features. Examples of indoor offerings include centerhung displays, landmark displays, video walls, ribbon board displays, hanging banners, corporate office entrance displays, conference room displays, and video displays designed for retail stores, restaurants, malls, transportation hubs and other similar indoor facilities.
Video displays provide content to serve as a revenue generation source through advertising or as an information and communication medium (such as scoring, statistics, wayfinding, advertising, control center information), or to provide interior design elements to create luxurious space to feature digital art.
Our mobile and modular display systems are transportable and are comprised of lightweight individual LED video panels less than a square meter in size and are assembled together to form a display in a customizable size. These displays are used for both indoor and outdoor touring shows and for other live events.
Our display technology may be integrated with architectural mesh to deliver a dynamic communication medium that provides a semi-transparent viewing experience within a building. These displays can be mounted over a solid facade or in front of windows, resulting in a finished solution that is free from visible cabling and delivers a clean, semi-transparent view. These displays are less than one inch in depth and provide an elegant, refined structural appearance.
Our line of freeform LED displays is architectural lighting and display products. The ProPixel® freeform products use mountable LED elements to transform ordinary structures into stunning visual landmarks. A flexible mounting platform allows designers to transform any structure into a full-motion video display.
The control components for video displays in live event applications include our Show Control Software Suite, proprietary digital media players and video processors. These control components provide advanced capabilities for the display of live video and real-time content on our displays. The Show Control Software Suite can operate an entire network of displays within a venue from a single, intuitive control interface. Its features allow users to instantly deliver media clips, camera feeds, and streaming information to any display in a network.
Scoreboards and Timing Systems. Our line of scoreboards and timing products include indoor and outdoor scoreboards for many different sports, digit displays, scoring and timing controllers, statistics software and other related products. Indoor and outdoor systems range in complexity from small scoreboards to larger systems incorporating scoring, timing, video, message centers, advertising panels and control software.
We offer a variety of controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays. These controllers vary in complexity from the All Sport® 100, a handheld controller for portable scoreboards, to the All Sport® Pro, designed for more sophisticated scoring systems and allowing for more user-defined options.
We also offer timing systems for sports events, primarily aquatics and track competitions. A component of these systems is our OmniSport® timing console. The system has the capability to time and rank the competitors and to interface with event management software to facilitate the sporting event. Other timing system components include swimming touchpads, race start systems, and relay take-off platforms.
As a key component of an integrated system, we market sports statistics and results software under the DakStats® trademark. The software allows the entry and display of sports statistics and other information. It is one of the leading applications of its type in collegiate and high school sports.
Message Displays. The Galaxy® product line is a family of full-matrix displays, available in both indoor and outdoor models and controlled with the Venus® Control Suite. Galaxy® displays are full color or monochrome with varying pixel spacing depending on color, size and viewing distance. Galaxy® displays can display text, graphics and animation, as well as prerecorded video clips. They are used primarily to convey information and on-premises advertising to consumers.
The Venus® Control Suite software is used to control the creation of messages and graphic sequences for uploading to the Galaxy® displays. This software is designed to be user friendly and applicable to all general advertising or message applications. It can be used to control a single message display or can scale up to provide a secure, cloud-based control center for large networks of message displays.
ITS Dynamic Message Signs ("DMS"). DMS products include a wide range of LED displays for road management applications. The Vanguard® family of dynamic message displays is typically used to direct traffic and inform motorists. 
These displays are used over freeways, on arterial roads, near bridges, at toll booths and in other locations. We have also developed a Vanguard® control system for these displays to help transportation agencies manage large networks of displays.
Mass Transit Displays. Our Mass Transit products include a wide range of LCD and LED display solutions for public transportation applications. Installations often involve a network of displays located on railway platforms, at bus stations, or on concourses within a transportation hub to guide travelers to their intended destination.

Raw Materials
Materials used in the production of our video display and control systems are sourced from around the world. Examples of the materials we use in production include LEDs, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, power supplies, plastics, aluminum, and steel. We source some of our materials from a single-source or a limited number of suppliers due to the proprietary nature of the materials. The loss of a key supplier, part unavailability, tariff changes, price changes, war or other geopolitical impacts to trade or transport, or defects in the supplied material or component could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. Our sourcing group works to implement strategies to mitigate these risks. Periodically, we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract, which generally does not exceed one year. We also periodically prepay for future supply.
Since late fiscal 2021, we have been affected by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures stemming from the coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19"), shipping container shortages, weather events, and the changes in global demand. Specifically, we are impacted by the global inflation and shortage of semiconductors and related electronic components, 
other materials needed for production, and freight. We are unable to predict the supply chain recovery or the impact to our business.
Intellectual Property
We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis. Our policy is to protect our competitive position by filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. This will allow us to pursue infringement claims against competitors for protection due to patent violations. Although we own a number of patents and possess rights under others to which we attach importance, we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. We also own a number of trademarks that we believe are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no part of our business materially depends on such trademarks. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements with our employees and agents to protect our intellectual property. Despite these intellectual property protections, there can be no assurance a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products.
Seasonality
Our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of uniquely configured orders, such as display systems for professional sports facilities, colleges and universities, and spectacular projects in the commercial area, as well as the seasonality of the sports market. Uniquely configured orders can include several displays, controllers, and subcontracted structure builds, each of which can occur on varied schedules per the customer's needs. Our third fiscal quarter sales and profit levels are lighter than other quarters due to the seasonality of our sports business, construction cycles, and the reduced number of production days due to holidays in the quarter.
Our gross margins tend to fluctuate more on uniquely configured orders than on limited configured orders. Uniquely configured orders involving competitive bidding and substantial subcontracting work for product installation generally have lower gross margins. Although we follow the over time method of recognizing revenues for uniquely configured orders, we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations.
Because of the seasonality and volatility in business demand and variety of product types, we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may negatively affect our business and operating results.
Working Capital
For information regarding working capital items, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-K.
Customers
We have a large and diverse worldwide customer base, ranging from local main street business owners and out-of-home companies to the owners and operators of premier professional sports arenas. Our customers are important to us, and we strive to serve them over the long-term to earn their future business. The loss of one or more customers could have an adverse effect on us. See "Note 3. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for our primary markets and customers of each business unit.
Product Order Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar value of orders for integrated electronic display systems and related products and services which are expected to be recognized in net sales in the future. Orders are contractually binding purchase commitments from customers. Orders are included in backlog when we are in receipt of an executed contract and any required deposits or security and have not yet been recognized into net sales. Certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be included in backlog until all required contractual documents and deposits are received. Orders and backlog are not measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), and our methodology for determining orders and backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their orders and backlog amounts.
Order and backlog levels provide management and investors additional details surrounding the results of our business activities in the marketplace and highlight fluctuations caused by seasonality and our large project business. Management uses orders to evaluate market share and performance in the competitive environment. Management uses backlog information for capacity and resource planning. We believe order information is useful to investors because it provides an indication of our market share. We believe backlog information is useful to investors to provide an indication of future revenues. 
Our product order backlog as of April 30, 2022 was $471.6 million as compared to $250.7 million as of May 1, 2021. This increase in backlog is driven by record order volume and muted conversion to sales due to supply chain challenges. Our customers have also placed orders for future deliveries to secure our manufacturing capacity.
We expect to fulfill the backlog as of April 30, 2022 within the next 24 months. The timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays resulting from parts availability and other constraints stemming from the supply chain disruptions.
Government and Other Regulation
In the United States and other countries, various laws, regulations and ordinances related to our products and controllers restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays, particularly in the commercial and transportation markets. These laws and regulations impose greater restrictions on electronic displays versus non-electronic displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. Globally, our products are also subject to various regulations and standards including electromagnetic interference, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, and flammability standards. We design and have our products tested for these regulations; however, these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers in certain geographies.
Our manufacturing facilities and products comply with industry specific requirements, including environmental rules and regulations and safety standards. These requirements include quality, manufacturing process controls, manufacturing documentation, supplier certification of raw materials, and various safety tests. Our production processes require the storage, use and disposal of a variety of hazardous chemicals under applicable laws.
Our global supply chain and sales distribution channels subject us to various trade compliance regulations. These requirements can include certification of country of origin, classification within the various tariff codes and trade agreements, compliance with other specific product or country import/export regulations, and payment of certain import or export tariffs, duties, or taxes.
Our global operations subject us to various laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to tax compliance, anti-corruption, data privacy, cybersecurity, governance, and disclosure reporting. These requirements vary and can involve matters and processes such as using resources for related expertise and information systems, records management, policy creation and maintenance, data protection programs, compliance filings, control design and testing, and continued training of employees.
We are subject to regulations restricting the movement and interaction of people and business operations. During unprecedented times, such as during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and the U.S. states and/or its localities can issue lock down orders impacting availability of employees, third parties, suppliers, customers, and other services we need to operate our business.
We believe we are in material compliance with government and other regulatory requirements.
Competition
We encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product, geographic area, and business unit. Our competitors include both United States and foreign companies which range in size and product offerings. Our competitors may develop lower-cost or lower-featured products, may be willing to charge lower prices to increase their market share, or include different service and controller offerings. Some competitors have more capital, governmental funding, supply change access, and other resources, which may allow them to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements. Other competitors use sponsorships as a way to win business at a particular location or market. In addition, our products compete with other forms of advertising, such as television, print media and fixed display signs.
We believe that our ability to compete depends upon customer centric product and service quality and features, technical expertise, service breadth, and cost-effective solutions.
Research and Development
Our experience in engineering, process design, and product and service design and development capabilities, and investments made in affiliates are very important factors in continuing to develop, produce, and offer the most up-to-date digital displays and control system solutions desired by the market.
Over the past years, we have invested in our development and our affiliates to increase our differentiated product platforms, advance our software architecture and offerings, support customer requirements, and advance new competitive narrow pixel and micro-electronic technologies.
Product design and development investments in the near term are focused on developing or improving our video technology over a wide range of pixel pitches for both indoor and outdoor applications. These new or improved technologies are focused on varied pixel density for image quality and use, expanded product line offerings for our various markets and geographies, improved quality and reliability, and improved cost points.
Employees and Human Capital Resource Management
Our core values of Honest, Helpful and Humble support our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, which leads to our vision of every person at Daktronics being able to contribute their best every day. We seek to recruit, retain, and develop our existing and future workforce for decades-long engagements to build long-term mutual prosperity. We facilitate company-wide groups and teamwork to inspire a more inclusive culture. We encourage each employee to proactively and continuously build self-awareness, understanding of aspects of diversity, and openness to others’ experiences and perspectives. 
The safety and well-being of our team are a top priority, and we believe each and every team member plays an essential role in creating a safe and healthy workplace. We provide training for safety measures on the job site and in our facilities. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we consider to be in the best interest of our employees. We implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work and allowed employees to work from home when able. We believe we have been able to preserve our business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of April 30, 2022, we employed approximately 2,246 full-time employees and 231 part-time and temporary employees. Of these employees, approximately 937 were in manufacturing, 468 were in sales and marketing, 503 were in customer service, 354 were in engineering and 215 were in general and administrative. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe employee relations are good.
