  CRYPTO Mining Packages
  
 We offer Crypto Mining Packages that consist of computer/GPU hardware, operation and maintenance services to provide individuals access to crypto mining. Our mining hardware (hosting) facility is arranged through contractual partnership and located in Romania. Each GPU processing card is specific to the package purchased, is individually serial numbered, and the customer may request their hardware to be shipped to them at any time. There is no guarantee or estimate of mining output provided as mining conditions change constantly and crypto currency is subject to a number of risks associated with emerging markets. We believe our mining services which are physically housed, monitored and maintained in a dedicated facility eliminates variables associated with other mining services that are typically cloud based.
 Equity Markets
  
 Our Equity education and alerts is our core offering and brings the knowledge and expertise of individuals who have been involved in the market for years directly to the user. Our equity services are now included in every subscription service. Our market experts provide the financial technology, education, and research that allows the user to make decisions concerning the user’s money in the market. The user maintains complete control of the user’s money by using an online brokerage of their choosing. Most equity pack strategies require a margin account, and users need level four options approval or higher.

  KEEP
  
 The core component of our Keep philosophy is the Deductr Pro software and its ability to track and manage potential tax write-offs including automated mileage tracking in real-time. Fully deploying the capabilities of Deductr, an individual can see their up to the minute potential tax write offs throughout the year. Tax season becomes a painless submission of Deductr reports versus the agonizing manual process of trying to calculate expenditures once per year. In addition, Deductr Pro is instrumental in budget creation and expense management in real-time.
 Our Packages
  
 Each of our packages includes all three components of the FIND * GROW * KEEP philosophy. The only change in package offerings is the type of financial research and education selected in the GROW portion. All subscriptions include the full breadth of Kuvera University education regardless of subscription selected. We view this as our value commitment, ensuring a full suite of education with each product subscription.
  
 Each of our product packages includes a ten day no questions asked return policy. Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time and are billed monthly.
  
  Distribution Method
  
 The Company uses an affiliate model to sell its product subscriptions. Anyone with an interest can participate in our bonus plan that rewards them for selling product subscriptions. We believe this component of our offering is extremely powerful as it provides:
  
   ●
 An additional income stream for the customer who decides to become a distributor

 
   ●
 Individuals are much more comfortable discussing financial matters with people they know

 
   ●
 The network becomes a support system for the customers as they learn together and share their experiences.

 The affiliate distribution model, while powerful, requires strict policies and procedures to ensure the company’s presentation and messaging are accurate and compliant. An affiliate/distributor is not required to be a customer to sell our products.
  
  Competition
  
 The Company faces competition for each of its product categories but does not have a similar competitor with the full suite of services offered. Each of the financial education products, alerts, tools and newsletters face competition from similar product companies such as TheStreet.com, The Motley Fool, Jim Cramer anzzd similar subscription based financial research services. The personal money management education and tools face competition from free mobile apps designed for the same purpose although Investview’s personal money management does not advertise or entice the user to refinance, secure new loans and is a pure management tool that serves the individual and not the advertiser. The company’s tax management tools and education have limited competition and we have deployed Deductr Pro as our tool of choice. Unique to our company is not the individual product but the combined suite of products for one monthly subscription price, cancellable at any time by the user and distributed exclusively by the active members through the optional bonus plan for those who choose to sell the service to others.
  
 We believe our competitive advantages include:
  
   ●
 A generous bonus program for independent affiliates

 
   ●
 A management team with extensive experience in financial education and market strategy research/technology

 
   ●
 A young and motivated distributor base

 
   ●
 A large demographic that services all genders, races, religions, and nationalities

 
   ●
 A delivery platform enabling us to launch new products quickly and efficiently worldwide

 
 Our competitive weaknesses include:
  
   ●
 translation challenges as we continue international expansion

 
   ●
 components of our distributor backend that are programmed by third-party providers

 
  Intellectual Property
  
 The Company’s success is predicated on the adoption of new and innovative technology, education and research along with constantly improving convenience tools. The delivery of alerts and financial information through our platform provides various levels of automation that is programmed and designed by the company exclusively for our products and modified to enable the individual to initiate action on alerts they desire. We own the intellectual property for many of our products strategies and platform delivery mechanisms while we make other products available through licensed arrangements. In this way, we can continually offer a full suite of “best of breed” services to ensure our members are receiving the most value and leading-edge programs for their monthly subscription.
 Expansion
  
 The Company is in the process of expanding the business internationally. International planning and re-structuring is taking place as a result of the recent name change to Kuvera and will be rolled out in the later part of 2018. Our affiliated entity, WG LATAM S.A.S., which has been re-established to Kuvera LATAM S.A.S,, distributes the Company’s products and services in Colombia and surrounding Latin American countries. International operations can be impacted by international regulations and economic conditions, although all are continuously monitored.
 Government Regulation
  
 We have positioned the Company as a knowledge provider and educator, which seeks to augment a user’s informed decision-making process, rather than act as a conductor of investment decisions or a representative of investment services. As such, our activities do not fall within the scope of securities industry regulation. We do not provide securities brokerage or investment advisory services. Our products and services also do not require that any representative distributing the services of Investview conduct themselves as an investment advisor or broker. We in fact encourage all representatives and users of our information services to seek unrelated investment professionals for securities related activities.

 We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly-owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally. We are also increasingly subject to government regulation and legislation specifically targeting Internet companies, such as privacy regulations adopted at the local, state, national and international levels and taxes levied at the state level. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, enforcement of existing laws, such as consumer protection regulations, in connection with Web-based activities has become more aggressive, and it is expected that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could inhibit the growth in use of the Internet and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, which could in turn decrease the demand for our services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business.
