 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 On January 31, 2019 we completed the acquisition of five marketed non-narcotic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (“NSAID”) products from Iroko Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Iroko”) (the “Iroko Acquisition”). In exchange for the products, Iroko received $45 million in our new senior secured debt and 49% of our new equity, prior to the dilution associated with our stock-based incentive compensation plan. To facilitate this transaction and reorganize our capital structure, we completed proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware. Our previous convertible debt was equitized, and our previous senior secured holders received $20 million in cash and $50 million in the new senior secured notes, as well as 19.38% of our new equity.
 We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company commercializing innovative treatments for different types of pain and inflammation. Given the need for acute and chronic pain products and the issue of prescription abuse, we are primarily focused on bringing non-narcotic and abuse-discouraging opioid formulations to healthcare providers. We are currently selling SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray (“SPRIX Nasal Spray”), ZORVOLEX® (diclofenac), INDOCIN® (indomethacin) suppository, OXAYDO® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only—CII (“OXAYDO”), VIVLODEX® (meloxicam), TIVORBEX® (indomethacin) and INDOCIN oral suspension. We plan to continue to grow our business through the revenue growth of our seven approved products, business development and advancement of our product candidates from our pipeline with a partner or on our own in the future. 
 Strategy
 Our goal is to become a profitable pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain, inflammation and other conditions. Currently we are focused on commercializing our own products and identifying additional business development opportunities that could accelerate our path to profitability. Key elements of our strategy include:
· | Driving revenue growth from all seven of our marketed products. While we are driving growth from all seven of our products, we are primarily focused on SPRIX Nasal Spray, ZORVOLEX and INDOCIN suppositories as key revenue drivers. With our dedicated salesforce that we have expanded to 87 territory representatives, we are targeting approximately 8,000 pain medicine physicians, primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, orthopedic surgeons, urologists, podiatrists and neurologists in the United States with the intent to build awareness, educate and increase adoption of our products.

· | Conducting business development activities to build on our product portfolio. Our business development activities are focused on augmenting our product portfolio through in-licensing and acquisition of late-stage and commercial products. We are looking for products and product candidates that complement our current portfolio, and physician targets, in the pain management space, adjacent to pain management or in a market where our products are primarily used, including in hospital. In addition, we are exploring partnership opportunities for our current products outside of our healthcare professional targets and geographical areas of focus.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Managing lifecycle of our products. We are working on new formulations that could improve SPRIX Nasal Spray, and potentially add new intellectual property. We anticipate having data on the new formulation in the second half of 2019. We also believe there are potential additional indications for the INDOCIN suppository and are considering doing additional development work to explore these new indications.

Market Opportunity Given the Issue of Pain and Prescription Abuse
 According to the National Institutes of Health, pain and inflammation affect more Americans than those with diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. The millions suffering from different types of pain and inflammation every year greatly impacts the United States with increasing costs associated with health care, rehabilitation and lost worker productivity. With opioids broadly available, prescription opioid abuse has become a significant problem with an estimated 1.7 million people suffering from drug use disorders in the United States according to the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality’s 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Opioids (both extended release (“ER”) and immediate-release (“IR”) forms) are prone to being misused or abused through physical and chemical manipulation to increase the speed of the drug release into the bloodstream, accelerating and intensifying its effects. In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) estimates that the total economic burden of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment and criminal justice involvement.
     In reaction to this widespread prescription opioid misuse and abuse, the U.S. government and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) have designated this issue as a high priority. The FDA continues to highlight strategies to combat this issue of prescription opioid abuse with a focus on using and developing new non-narcotic treatment options. Over the past few years, the FDA has revised the indication for both IR and ER opioids to be used when the pain is severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. According to the CDC, the first line of therapy should be non-opioid treatments, such as NSAIDs. In a 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap, the FDA highlighted the development of opioids designed to deter or discourage abuse as a part of the solution. Given the importance of management of pain and inflammation and, the ongoing abuse epidemic, there is a need for non-narcotic options, such as NSAIDs, and opioids designed to discourage abuse.
     Our Products   
NSAID Market
     According to a JAMA Network Open 2019 article, NSAIDs are among the most widely prescribed medications in the world due to their demonstrated efficacy in reducing pain and inflammation, with 70 million prescriptions written annually in the United States. They are used to treat a variety of painful conditions including acute pain, back pain, gout, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. NSAIDs provide relief from symptoms of many of these conditions including pain and inflammation. While NSAIDs are generally considered to be safe and effective, they have also been associated with dose-related serious adverse events in some patients, including gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular events. The recognized correlation between systemic exposure to NSAIDs and these adverse events led the FDA, to issue its 2005 public health advisory recommending that NSAIDs should be used at their lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time. The FDA requires companies to provide a medication guide which informs patients of the need to discuss with their doctor the risks and benefits of using NSAIDs and the importance of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible if treatment with an NSAID is warranted for an individual.

 SoluMatrix® Technology NSAID Products
 The SoluMatrix technology platform is used in three of the products we acquired from Iroko. This technology was developed in response to the FDA’s support of using the lowest NSAID dose possible. SoluMatrix uses a dry milling process to reduce the NSAID drug particle size by at least ten times. The smaller particle size results in increased surface area relative to mass, which increases the dissolution and absorption rates without changing the chemical structures of the drug molecules themselves. Because of this altered absorption profile, the SoluMatrix NSAID products dissolve and are absorbed at a rate that allows for the rapid onset of pain relief at lower doses and lower systemic exposures than other NSAIDs. 
 ZORVOLEX is a novel formulation of diclofenac developed using the SoluMatrix technology platform providing patients 23 percent lower overall systemic exposure versus other forms of diclofenac. This low-dose diclofenac is approved for mild to moderate acute pain and osteoarthritis pain. Diclofenac, meloxicam and indomethacin represent 34 percent of the overall NSAID market. According to IMS, there were 20 million diclofenac prescriptions in 2017. ZORVOLEX has shown to be promotionally sensitive and represents an opportunity to garner a larger percentage of the diclofenac market.
 VIVLODEX is a SoluMatrix formulation of meloxicam approved for osteoarthritis pain. VIVLODEX is dosed once daily and offers patients low dose and low systemic exposure. According to IMS data in 2017, there were 31 million meloxicam prescriptions. 
 TIVORBEX, also developed using the SoluMatrix technology, is the first low-dose SoluMatrix indomethacin for mild to moderate acute pain in adults approved by the FDA. TIVORBEX is the lowest FDA-approved dose of indomethacin available.
 SPRIX Nasal Spray
 SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray is an NSAID indicated in adult patients for the short term (up to five days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. This non-narcotic provides patients with moderate to moderately severe short-term pain a form of ketorolac that is absorbed rapidly but does not require an injection administered by a healthcare provider (“HCP”). Specialists, including urologists, podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons, use SPRIX Nasal Spray for post-surgery acute-pain management. 
 Formulated as a nasal spray, SPRIX Nasal Spray is rapidly absorbed through the nasal mucosa, achieving peak blood levels as fast as an intramuscular injection of ketorolac. SPRIX Nasal Spray has been studied in patients with moderate to moderately severe pain. SPRIX Nasal Spray has demonstrated a 26 to 34 percent reduction in morphine use by patients over a 48-hour period in a post-operative setting as compared with placebo. We acquired SPRIX Nasal Spray and certain related assets from Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Luitpold”) in January 2015 for $7.0 million. SPRIX Nasal Spray is currently sold in the United States and the first commercial sale of SPRIX Nasal Spray occurred in May 2011. In 2018, we grew SPRIX Nasal Spray net revenues more than 17 percent over the previous year. We currently believe there is an opportunity for continued revenue growth with this important product given its ability to provide opioid-level pain relief in a non-narcotic.

 INDOCIN Products
 We acquired two forms of INDOCIN (indomethacin) from Iroko, an oral solution and a suppository. There are no other branded NSAID suppositories available in the United States. Both products are approved for many indications including: moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease, moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe osteoarthritis, acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis. We believe there are potential additional indications for the INDOCIN suppository, and we are considering conducting development work to explore these potential additional indications. 
 IR Oxycodone Market
 Oxycodone immediate-release (IR) medication starts to work within a few minutes of administration. It delivers pain relief for up to six hours. According to a 2018 Medpage Today article, Oxycodone IR product prescriptions increased from about 14.5 million in 2013 to about 17.3 million in 2017 in the United States. According to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an estimated 11.8 million Americans age 12 and older misused prescription pain relievers in the past year. Also, according to the Medpage Today article, calls to U.S. Poison Control Centers between 2012-2016 reporting intentional exposure to oxycodone were far more likely to involve IR products than ER ones. With this pattern of IR opioid abuse, we believe it is important to have products designed to discourage abuse. Common methods of manipulating medications in pill or tablet form include crushing to swallow, snort or smoke, and dissolving to inject. 
 OXAYDO, an abuse-discouraging IR oxycodone product.
 OXAYDO is an approved IR oxycodone product designed using an aversion technology to discourage abuse via snorting. It is indicated for the management of acute and chronic pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. It was approved in 2011 prior to the FDA Guidance for Industry, Abuse-Deterrent Opioids – Evaluation and Labeling (“FDA AD Guidance”) on abuse-deterrent opioids. The label includes results from a Category 3 AD study that evaluated drug liking after snorting crushed OXAYDO compared to crushed Roxicodone (oxycodone hydrochloride tablets USP). We licensed OXAYDO from Acura Pharmaceuticals (“Acura”) in January 2015 for a $5.0 million upfront payment and a $2.5 million milestone payment upon commercial launch. In addition, Acura is entitled to a one-time $12.5 million milestone payment if OXAYDO net sales reach $150.0 million in a calendar year and a tiered royalty percentage based on sales thresholds. We are focused on further educating the approximate 500 current OXAYDO prescribers on the potential benefits of this product. OXAYDO is covered by six U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2025. Patents covering OXAYDO in foreign jurisdictions expire in 2024.  
 U.S. Commercialization Strategy
 Since we acquired and licensed SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO respectively, we have built a fully scaled commercial organization focused on educating providers taking care of individuals with pain, both acute and chronic. As the market demonstrated a greater appetite for non-narcotics, we increased our focus on the promotion of our NSAID SPRIX Nasal Spray. We acquired the Iroko products not only because they are NSAIDs, but because they can be promoted with our existing salesforce at little additional expense. We already had over 80 territories focused on similar targets. We added additional geographies where the Iroko products had been previously marketed. With our dedicated employee sales force, we can cover 99 percent of existing SPRIX targets and 98 percent of existing ZORVOLEX targets. Our 87 sales representatives promote our products to approximately 8,000 healthcare providers in the United States. We believe that our focused targeting, sales force execution, proper brand positioning, message delivery and education, as well as our focus on ensuring proper product access to patients who require our therapies, will help us achieve our promotional goals. As part of our commercial strategy, we are working to enhance patient access to our products where possible through reducing co-pays, increasing availability of our products in pharmacies and in some cases providing more access to product samples.  For approximately the same operating expense, we believe we can significantly increase our potential annual revenue.

 In addition to our own salesforce, we partner with other commercial pharmaceutical companies in therapeutic or geographic areas where our in-house team does not target. In 2017, we signed an agreement with Ascend Therapeutics to promote SPRIX Nasal Spray to approximately 11,000 women’s healthcare providers. In early 2018, we announced an agreement with OraPharma to promote SPRIX Nasal Spray along with their own portfolio products to its target dentists, dental specialist, and oral surgeons. OraPharma began promotion of SPRIX Nasal Spray in the first quarter of 2018. On February 26, 2019, OraPharma provided us notice that it was terminating the Co-Promotion Agreement and would cease promotion of SPRIX Nasal Spray effective April 27, 2019. We continue to seek additional partnerships for our approved products to expand our commercial reach.
 Global Partnerships
 As part of the Iroko Acquisition, Egalet acquired rights with respect to six international distribution arrangements with companies seeking to register and market ZORVOLEX and VIVLODEX in their respective territories. Four of those distribution partners have secured registration of ZORVOLEX in nine territories and of VIVLODEX in one territory. Egalet is evaluating these relationships to determine strategic fit. Product Candidates and Proprietary Guardian Technology Platform
 While our current focus is on our commercial products, we have a pipeline of product candidates. Our primary effort is to identify potential partners to advance these product candidate; however, we may consider developing them ourselves in the future. One of our product candidates, a naproxen product, was developed using the SoluMatrix technology to create a lower dose NSAID. Our other product candidates were developed using our proprietary Guardian technology. 
 Our proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet technology that utilizes a novel application of the well-established manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets that are structurally hard and difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. While our Guardian Technology creates a tablet that is extremely hard and has AD features, the construct of the tablet allows for controlled release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in the gastrointestinal tract. This approach offers the ability to design tablets with controlled-release profiles as well as physical and chemical properties that have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of manipulation. Tablets manufactured with Guardian Technology have been shown to have increased resistance to physical methods of manipulation, such as cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking using a variety of mechanical and electrical tools. The tablets are also resistant to chemical manipulation and turn into a viscous hydrogel on contact with liquid, making syringeability difficult.
 The Egalet Guardian Technology is a proven technology that was used to develop ARYMO ER, an AD, ER FDA-approved morphine. Due to payor pressure in the ER morphine space, we have discontinued the manufacturing, distribution and promotion of ARYMO ER. In addition to ARYMO ER, we have a pipeline of products developed using our Guardian Technology. Egalet-002, an ER, AD oxycodone formulation, employs a similar matrix system to that is used in ARYMO ER; however, the Egalet-002 tablet is surrounded by a water-impermeable, non-eroding, hard shell containing polylactic acid (“PLA”) that creates a cylinder, with the API-containing matrix exposed at both ends. We have two other product candidates that were developed using our Guardian Technology: Egalet-003, an AD stimulant product candidate, and Egalet-004, an AD, ER hydrocodone-based product candidate for which an initial Phase 1 bioavailability study has been conducted. Like Egalet-002 and the SoluMatrix Naproxen, we are not currently investing in these product candidates and are exploring the possibility of their further development with a partner or on our own at some point in the future.
 Manufacturing
 Our approved products are manufactured at contract manufacturing facilities in the United States. We have agreements with Catalent to manufacture and Patheon to package ZORVOLEX and TIVORBEX capsules, Neolpharma to manufacture and package VIVLODEX capsules, Patheon to manufacture INDOCIN oral suspension and ACP Nimble Buyer Inc. to supply INDOCIN suppositories. Jubilant HollisterStier (“JHS”) manufactures SPRIX Nasal Spray for us

and we purchase our required quantities of SPRIX Nasal Spray through purchase orders with JHS. We have an agreement with UPM Pharmaceuticals to produce OXAYDO.
 In September 2018, we signed an agreement to terminatcs (now part of Cambrex Corporation) related to the manufacture and supply of ARYMO ER. The manufacturing services agreement was terminated in connection with our discontinuation of the manufacture, distribution and promotion of ARYMO ER.
 Drug Substances
 The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) used in SPRIX Nasal Spray is ketorolac tromethamine, in OXAYDO is oxycodone hydrochloride, ZORVOLEX is diclofenac and VIVLODEX is meloxicam. Both INDOCIN oral suspension and suppositories, as well as TIVORBEX all use indomethacin as the API. We currently procure these APIs on a purchase order basis, some of which are pursuant to an agreement with one of our suppliers. We acquire ketorolac tromethamine and indomethacin from a European-based manufacturers, diclofenac and meloxicam from Indian-based manufacturers, while we secure the opioid APIs from a U.S.-based manufacturer.
 Oxycodone hydrochloride is classified as narcotic controlled substance under U.S. federal law. OXAYDO is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), meaning that these substances have the highest potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of OXAYDO are subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption “Governmental Regulation—DEA Regulation.”
 Intellectual Property
 We regard the protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own as critical to our success and competitive position. 
 In connection with the Iroko Acquisition, we entered into a license agreement with iCeutica Inc. and iCeutica Pty Ltd. (collectively, “iCeutica”). We exclusively license 19 U.S. patents from iCeutica, all of which cover iCeutica’s SoluMatrix® technology and relate to composition of matter, process of manufacturing or method of use of three of our products, VIVLODEX, ZORVOLEX and TIVORBEX. Three of the U.S. patents that cover VIVLODEX are listed patents under the Approved Drug Products and Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication, or Orange Book, seven of the U.S. patents are Orange Book listed patents that cover ZORVOLEX and another three of the U.S. patents are Orange Book listed patents that cover TIVORBEX. The remaining U.S. patents relate to the SoluMatrix technology. There are nine pending patent applications in the United States relating to the SoluMatrix technology and the three products. These patents expire between 2030 and 2035. Prior to Iroko Acquisition, Iroko settled patent infringement litigation with Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Lupin”), which settlement will allow Lupin to launch a generic form of ZORVOLEX prior to the expiration of the patents covering ZORVOLEX, no later than the second half of 2023.
 Both Lupin and Novitium Pharma have submitted an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of VIVLODEX. The notices from Lupin and Novitium Pharma included a “Paragraph IV certification” with respect to the Orange Book VIVLODEX patents alleging that these patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of Lupin and Novitium Pharma’s proposed generic product. iCeutica and Iroko sued Lupin over its ANDA for a generic version of VIVLODEX. The district court granted Lupin’s motion for summary judgment on non-infringement and dismissed the amended complaint. The case is now on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. As part of our license with iCeutica, we have agreed, and intend, to vigorously enforce iCeutica’s rights under the VIVLODEX related patents but cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
 In addition, we license seven U.S. patents and five foreign patents from Acura Pharmaceuticals, all of which cover Acura’s Aversion Technology and relate to the composition of matter. Six of the seven U.S. patents are Orange Book listed patents that cover OXAYDO. These patents expire between 2023 and 2025. In addition, we license one U.S. and five foreign patent applications relating to OXAYDO and Acura’s Aversion Technology, all of which relate to the composition of matter.

 We own two U.S. patents that expire in 2029 and two pending U.S. patent applications, directed to processes of manufacture, devices, and compositions, related to SPRIX Nasal Spray. We held an exclusive license from Recordati to a U.S. patent listed in the Orange Book covering SPRIX Nasal Spray which patent expired in December 2018. We are aware that there is the possibility of generic entrants and if those generic products were to come to market, there could be a material impact on our revenues. We are exploring ways to extend the life of our SPRIX Nasal Spray patents. 
 We own 23 issued patents within the United States, covering our product candidates incorporating our Guardian technology platform. The term of our overall domestic patent portfolio related to ARYMO ER, Egalet-002 and our Guardian Technology platform, excluding possible patent extensions, extends to various dates between 2022 and 2033.
 We own two pending patent applications under active prosecution in the United States covering our product, product candidates and technology platform. We have one pending patent application in the United States relating to ARYMO ER and one pending relating to our Guardian Technology. The types of protection that may be afforded by any patent that may be issued from these applications include composition of matter, process of manufacturing or method of us. 
 We own two patents within the United States and an additional 25 issued foreign patents covering the Parvulet® technology and relates to composition of matter. The Parvulet technology entails a dosage form that transforms into a “pudding-like” mass within seconds when a small amount of water is added and addresses the growing need for better pediatric and geriatric therapeutics. These patents expire in 2025. 
 In addition, we own and have one pending international application covering oral delivery of biomacromolecules applying injection molding technology to safely position an active substance into the intestinal wall resulting in effective exposure of active substances.
 Competition
 We face competition and potential competition from several sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies and drug delivery companies. Oral NSAIDs such as celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam and naproxen are the major competitors for our NSAID products. The key competitive factors in this market are product effectiveness, product safety profile, brand awareness and managed care access. According to 2018 data from IQVIA, ibuprofen is the most prescribed NSAID with about a 31% share of prescriptions in the United States in 2018. Meloxicam is the second most commonly prescribed NSAID with approximately a 20% share of U.S. prescriptions in 2018 and is one of the fastest growing among currently marketed NSAIDs, with a compound annual growth rate of 18% from 2007 to 2011, despite the fact that it is generic and not promoted. We believe the growth of meloxicam is due to its perceived safety profile relative to other NSAID products. While celecoxib had the largest share of revenue of NSAID products sold in 2018, we believe its share of prescriptions has declined as a result of physicians continuing to shift prescriptions away from COX-2 inhibitors and due to declining promotional efforts as the product’s patent protection nears expiration.
 We expect that OXAYDO will compete with ROXYBOND, an ADF, IR oxycodone developed by Inspirion and to be marketed by Daiichi Sankyo (“Daiichi”) when it is launched. There are a considerable number of opioid product candidates under development that could be potential competitors for OXAYDO, including AD formulations of currently available opioids, novel opioids and alternative delivery forms of various opioids under development at other pharmaceutical companies. The key competitive factors in this market are product effectiveness, product safety profile, brand awareness and managed care access. OXAYDO may also face competition from non-opioid product candidates including new chemical entities (“NCEs”), as well as alternative delivery forms of NSAIDs. These new opioid and non-opioid product candidates are being developed by companies such as Acura, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hospira, Inc., Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, Intellipharmaceutics International Inc., Nektar Therapeutics and QRxPharma Ltd.

 Government Regulation

FDA Approval Process
     In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”) warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA approval process can be time consuming and cost intensive and companies may, and often do, re-evaluate the path of a particular product or product candidate at different points in the approval and post-approval process, even deciding, in some cases, to discontinue development of a product candidate or take a product off the market
 Pharmaceutical product development in the United States for a new product or related to changes to an approved product typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans, unless the FDA authorizes that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin sooner than 30 days after submission. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin, as long as other necessary approvals (for example, an institutional review board (“IRB”) overseeing clinical study sites) have been granted.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers and/or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of human subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, concerns about subjects, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, 

 
  10

 
and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Another scenario which allows for a single Phase 3 efficacy/safety study is via the 505(b)(2) pathway when the investigational product is not bioequivalent to the RLD but can still utilize other safety data from the reference agent for a submission.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,6 million for FDA’s fiscal year 2019 (October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019), and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees, currently $310,000 per product in FDA’s fiscal year 2019. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10-12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider major amendments to pending NDAs. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but takes into consideration the recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including most changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Post Approval Requirements 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution may be pursued. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”)
 The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) of 1987 and the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 govern the storage, handling, and distribution of prescription drug samples. The law prohibits the sale, purchase, or trade (including an offer to sell, purchase or trade) of prescription drug samples; it also imposes various requirements upon manufacturers, including but not limited to, proper storage of samples, documentation of request and receipt of samples, validation of requesting practitioner’s licensure, periodic inventory and reconciliation of samples, notification to the FDA of loss or theft of samples, and procedures for auditing sampling activity. In addition, section 6004 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) also requires manufacturers to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that were requested and distributed to licensed HCPs in a given year.     The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product, active ingredient, or method of use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the listed patents covering the approved drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form, with essentially the same labeling as the listed drug, and that has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify or make certain representations to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii 

 
  12

 
statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method‑of‑use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of an NCE drug product, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been previously approved by the FDA in another NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive or review any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, discussed in more detail below, that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. Although NCE exclusivity runs for five years, an ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 A drug may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug for which new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) are required, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation. During a three-year exclusivity period, the FDA can review, but cannot approve, an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the exclusivity-protected conditions.
 Additional types of exclusivity may be available, depending on the circumstances. For example, orphan drug seven-year exclusivity is available in connection with the approval of drugs for rare diseases. Pediatric exclusivity provides a six-month extension of patents and exclusivities if requested studies in children are performed.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the 

 
  13

 
approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCEy, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earliest of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three‑year marketing exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity, and pediatric exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes appropriate reports of new clinical studies and other criteria are satisfied.
 REMS
 The FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, commonly called a REMS, to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to support the safe use of the drug. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 In July 2012, the FDA approved a standardized REMS for all ER and long acting (LA) opioid drug products. ER formulations of morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone, among other opioids, are required to have a REMS.  This includes ARYMO ER. In September 2017, the FDA issued letters to manufacturers of IR opioid drug products announcing the agency’s intention to require a REMS for IR formulations as well.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly‑available information to gain knowledge regarding the existence and progress of development programs.
 DEA Regulation
 Our product OXAYDO is and our product candidate, Egalet‑002, if approved, will be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”), which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. In addition to DEA, state-controlled substance agencies and boards of pharmacy apply comparable requirements under state laws. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, accountability controls, security measures, and other controls in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Controlled substance registrants must monitor for and report suspicious orders, as well as thefts and significant losses of controlled substances.

 
  14

 

 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances, by definition, have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. An approved pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and associated harm, Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse and associated harm among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics:

· | high potential for abuse;
--+--------------------------


· | currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

  OXAYDO, an IR oxycodone product designed to discourage abuse via snorting is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA and we expect that Egalet‑002, an AD, ER oxycodone product candidate, if approved, will be as well. Other companies’ oxycodone products have been subject to recent scrutiny, litigation, and concerns. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products is subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician and may not be refilled without a new prescription. 
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Any of our products regulated as Schedule II controlled substances will be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much morphine and oxycodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate number of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our license partners and contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including oxycodone hydrochloride for use in manufacturing Egalet‑002 and OXAYDO. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our license partners and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.

 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval and, if applicable, DEA classification. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Many foreign countries are also signatories to the internal drug control treaties and have implemented regulations of controlled substances like those in the United States. Our products will be subject to such regulation which may impose certain regulatory and reporting requirements and restrict sales of these products in those countries.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations for marketing exclusively in one member state may be submitted as well as for marketing in more than one member state. Such marketing authorization for several member states may be submitted under a centralized, a decentralized, or a mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for simultaneous national marketing authorizations in more than one member state. Where a national marketing authorization has already been granted, the holder of a national marketing authorization may apply to the remaining member states for mutual recognition of the marketing authorization. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement, marketing, and commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General “OIG”), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, pharmaceutical manufacturers’ activities (including sales and marketing activities, as well as scientific/educational grant programs, among other activities) are subject to fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. These activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce another to (i) refer an individual for the furnishing of a pharmaceutical product for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid (“covered product”), (ii) purchase or order any covered product, (iii) arrange for the purchase or order of a covered product, or (iv) recommend a covered product. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to a wide range arrangements between 

 
  16

 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and others, including, but not limited to, any exchange of remuneration between a manufacturer and prescribers (such as physicians), purchasers, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), formulary managers, group purchasing organizations, hospitals, clinics and other health care providers, and patients. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, “value-added” services, the furnishing of supplies or equipment at no charge, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce referrals, prescribing, purchasing or recommending covered products may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Additionally, many states have adopted laws like the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors.  Violations of fraud and abuse laws such as the Anti-Kickback Statute may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Our arrangements and practices may not meet all the criteria of applicable exceptions and/or safe harbors for the Anti‑Kickback Statute in all cases, and thus would not be immune from prosecution under the Statute. Additionally, Anti‑Kickback Statute and similar state laws are subject to differing interpretations and may contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Finally, some of the safe harbor rules are currently under review for potential revision.  Given these variables, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar authorities.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability based on inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off‑label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement about the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, our marketing activities may be limited by data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established standards for “covered entities,” which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, regarding the security and privacy of protected health information. While we are not a covered entity under HIPAA, many of our customers are, and this limits the information they can share with us. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included expansion of HIPAA’s privacy, security and breach notification standards, called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which became effective February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security and breach standards (and certain privacy standards) directly applicable to “business associates,” which are entities that perform certain services on behalf 

 
  17

 
of covered entities involving the exchange of protected health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. While we do not currently perform any services that would render us a business associate under HIPAA/HITECH, it is possible that we may provide such services in the future and would be subject to the applicable provisions of HIPAA/HITECH. Finally, we may be directly subject to state privacy and security laws, regulations and other authorities, which may limit our ability to use and disclose identifiable information, and may impose requirements related to safeguarding such information, as well as reporting on breaches.
 Additionally, requirements under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to HHS information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to U.S. physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals. The Open Payments program also requires that manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to HHS ownership and investment interests held in them by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers’ reports are filed annually with the CMS by each March 31, covering the previous calendar year. CMS posts disclosed information on a publicly available website. There are also an increasing number of state laws that restrict or prohibit pharmaceutical manufacturers’ interactions with health care providers licensed in the respective states, and that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to, among other things, establish comprehensive compliance programs, adopt marketing codes of conduct, file periodic reports with state authorities regarding sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and register/license their sales representatives. A number of state laws require manufacturers to file reports regarding payments and items of value provided to health care providers (similar to the federal Open Payments program). Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑ marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. With respect to any of our products sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable privacy laws and post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Impact of Public Pressure on Drug Pricing, Healthcare Reform and Legislation Impacting Payor Coverage
     In the United States, federal and state authorities, as well as third-party payors, are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. There is increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices by federal and state lawmakers and enforcement authorities. In addition, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States, which will put additional pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
    
 
  18

 

 Drug pricing continues to be an agenda item in the current administration and in the Congress. In 2018, the current administration solicited comments on a proposal being developed to reset Medicare Part B drug payment rates to more closely align with international prices for the drugs paid by other countries. In 2019, the Administration proposed a rule to make clear that the Anti-Kickback Statute’s Discount Safe Harbor does not protect manufacturer rebates to PBMs or third-party payors but would create new safe harbors for rebates passed through to the point-of-sale and for fixed payments for services provided by PBMs, in an effort to reduce patient drug costs. In addition, there have been several recent state and federal lawmaker inquiries and proposed legislation as was the case in California designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing by requiring drug companies to notify insurers and government regulators of price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for the increase. There have also been actions to review the relationship between drug pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs and to reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
     The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug medicines. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Further, since 2017, both the U.S. Congress and current administration have enacted legislative and regulatory changes to repeal or dismantle certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and additional actions by Congress and the current administration to possibly repeal and replace it has on our business.        In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical drugs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans (also known as the Medicare “Donut Hole”), and increases in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent under current law to 70 percent. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.
     Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
     The commercial success of our products and product candidates, if and when approved, depends and will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third‑party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid as well as commercial healthcare plans and pharmacy benefits managers. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third‑party payors will continue to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
     The cost of pharmaceuticals and devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional regulatory and legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third‑party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
 Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.

 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost‑effective by third‑party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third‑party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Other Regulatory Requirements and Challenges to Regulatory Actions
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and other environmental and safety regulations. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Companies may petition governmental agencies, including the FDA, to discuss or take action with regard to regulatory decisions made relating to a product, product candidate or the company itself.
