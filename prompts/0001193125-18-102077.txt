Overview 
 Aldeyra Therapeutics is developing next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases. Aldeyras lead product candidate, reproxalap, is a first-in-class treatment in late-stage development for dry eye disease and other forms of ocular inflammation. We are leveraging our experience in ocular inflammation to develop other product candidates for systemic inflammatory disease. We intend to commercialize our products directly and through collaborations that expand global reach. 
 Inflammation is a significant component of many different diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and musculoskeletal conditions, affecting tens of millions of patients in the United States and hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Given the complexity of immune dysregulation, which involves many mediators and signaling pathways, rarely is any single therapeutic approach effective, and most inflammatory diseases are inadequately treated. As such, we believe inflammatory diseases represent considerable unmet medical need, and new immune-modulating therapies are therefore in high demand. In aggregate, we believe the potential markets for novel therapeutics that treat inflammation are considerable, representing in excess of $50 billion in the United States alone. 
 Our first immune-modulating therapeutic approach is, we believe, mechanistically novel, and is focused on the sequestration of pro-inflammatory aldehyde-containing mediators, which we refer to as RASP (Reactive Aldehyde Species that are Pro-inflammatory). We have developed a family of novel small molecule RASP scavengers, led by our product candidate reproxalap, which has been shown in multiple clinical trials to diminish inflammation. In addition to the RASP scavenger platform, we intend to discover or license other immune-modulating product candidates with novel mechanisms of action. For example, we have in-licensed a clinical-stage product candidate ADX-1612 (investigated in oncology under the name ganetespib), which inhibits Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90), a mechanistically differentiated potential approach for treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases. 
 As a topical ophthalmic solution, reproxalap was developed for the treatment of ocular inflammation, and has now demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement across an aggregate of four Phase 2 clinical trials in dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, and noninfectious anterior uveitis. Utilizing our experience in ocular inflammation, we intend to develop other RASP scavengers for systemic immune disease. In addition to our internal product development for systemic inflammatory diseases, we announced in February 2018 a partnership with Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, to develop other RASP scavengers for immune-mediated diseases. In the future, we may enter into additional partnerships that facilitate the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 As a topical dermatologic formulation, reproxalap demonstrated activity in improving the dermatologic disease in patients with Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS), a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by genetic

  mutations in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to accumulation of toxic aldehydes. SLS patients suffer from severe and generally intractable dermatologic and neurological disease. There is no therapy specifically for SLS that has been approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA), and no therapy is generally effective for the treatment of the skin disorder associated with SLS. As with our inflammation programs, we intend to continue to develop and, if approved by regulatory authorities, commercialize reproxalap for the treatment of the skin disease associated with SLS. 
 Our program in dry eye disease has begun Phase 2b clinical testing. Our program in noninfectious anterior uveitis has begun Phase 3 clinical testing, and our programs in allergic conjunctivitis and SLS are expected to begin Phase 3 clinical testing in the second quarter of 2018. Our systemic inflammation programs for our RASP scavenger platform and ADX-1612 are expected to begin clinical testing in 2019. A novel RASP scavenger is in pre-clinical development for retinal disease. All of our development timelines may be subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory review, preclinical and clinical results, and other factors that could delay the initiation, completion, or reporting of clinical trials. Our pipeline is illustrated below. 
 
Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues largely depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete development of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approvals for and to manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates. The results of our operations will vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter, and depend on a number of factors, including risks related to our business and industry, risks relating to intellectual property and other legal matters, risks related to our common stock, and other risks that are detailed in the section of this annual report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors. 
 The Markets for Our Product Candidates 
 Dry Eye Disease, Allergic Conjunctivitis, and Allergic Dry Eye Disease 
 The symptoms of dry eye disease (pain, dryness, gritty sensation) and allergic conjunctivitis (ocular itching, tearing) are chronic and persistently disturbing, leading to loss of work and substantial economic burden. There are approximately 20 million dry eye disease patients in the United States, yet only two drugs are approved for dry eye disease treatment, Restasis® (cyclosporine 0.05%) and Xiidra® (lifitegrast 5%). Both drugs are generally considered by patients and physicians to be inadequate, and may require weeks or months of treatment to achieve even modest clinical benefit. There are approximately 100 million patients in the United States with allergic conjunctivitis, and, we believe that approximately 30 million of such patients do not respond to, or are dissatisfied with, topical antihistamines, the current standard of care. A primary reason for dissatisfaction with antihistamines appears to be lack of durable activity, which may be due to the fact that increased histamine levels persist for only 10 to 20 minutes following allergen exposure. 
 
6 


 There is a high comorbidity between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, two of the most common inflammatory disorders of the eye. Approximately half of dry eye patients complain of itching, which is generally the result of allergy, and approximately half of allergic conjunctivitis patients complain of dryness. In the United States, despite a patient population of approximately 10 million, no drug is approved for the treatment of patients that suffer from both dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, a condition that we refer to as allergic dry eye disease (ADED). Neither Xiidra® nor Restasis® has demonstrated efficacy in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, and antihistamines exacerbate ocular dryness. Thus, with the possible exception of topical corticosteroids (discussed below), we believe that no currently marketed drug for dry eye disease or allergic conjunctivitis is likely to be effective for the treatment of ADED. Further, given the lack of available therapy, we believe that ADED is generally not adequately treated today. 
 By sequestering RASP, which are elevated in a variety of inflammatory diseases of the eye, reproxalap represents a novel mechanism for diminishing ocular inflammation in dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, and, potentially, ADED. In a Phase 2a clinical trial in dry eye disease and two Phase 2 clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis, reproxalap demonstrated consistent statistically significant and clinically relevant activity. Depending on the results of our Phase 2b and planned Phase 3 clinical trials in dry eye disease, reproxalap has the potential to compete directly with Restasis® and Xiidra®. Depending on the results of planned clinical trials in patients with ADED, and given that no currently marketed drug has demonstrated activity in ADED, reproxalap, if approved by regulatory authorities, could be used as first-line therapy for the treatment of ADED. 
 Most proprietary topical ophthalmic solutions are marketed at prices from $100 to $500 per month. Given that reproxalap potentially represents first-line therapy in ADED and, depending on clinical results, could offer superior efficacy or tolerability relative to existing medications in dry eye disease, our current expectation is that reproxalap could be priced similarly to, or at a premium to, currently marketed drugs for dry eye disease. Assuming a patient population of 10 million, the total addressable market for reproxalap therapy in dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, and ADED is approximately $10 billion in the United States. 
 Contingent on the results of current and planned clinical trials, in addition to regulatory authority approval, we intend to commercialize reproxalap ophthalmic solution directly and through marketing partnerships. Based in part on similar proprietary topical ocular product launches, we expect that approximately 300 sales representatives are required in the United States to launch reproxalap for ocular inflammation associated with dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, and ADED. 
 Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis 
 There are approximately 150,000 patients in the United States with noninfectious anterior uveitis, a potentially blinding disease that is currently treated with topical ocular corticosteroids. Topical ocular corticosteroid therapy is generally effective but toxic, leading to acute elevations of intraocular pressure that may result in glaucoma, another potentially blinding condition that requires lifelong daily medical therapy. Nearly all patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis will eventually develop glaucoma, in part due to corticosteroid therapy. 
 In a Phase 2 clinical trial in which patients were treated with either reproxalap, topical corticosteroids, or a combination of reproxalap and low-dose topical corticosteroids, reproxalap monotherapy was statistically non-inferior to either corticosteroid monotherapy or combination therapy, suggesting that reproxalap treatment was as effective as corticosteroid treatment. Unlike corticosteroids, reproxalap has not been shown to induce elevations in intraocular pressure. Thus, reproxalap represents a potentially safer therapeutic option for patients suffering from noninfectious anterior uveitis. 
 

7 


 Given the potential safety advantage of reproxalap, in conjunction with the relative rarity of noninfectious anterior uveitis, we expect that pricing could approach or exceed the high end of the current topical ocular medication range, approximately $500 per course. On average, most noninfectious anterior uveitis patients require one to two courses of treatment per year. 
 Contingent upon the results of the current Phase 3 clinical trial, in addition to FDA marketing approval, we intend to commercialize reproxalap ophthalmic solution for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis. Because the disease is severe and requires particular medical expertise, we estimate that there are only approximately 30 to 50 medical centers in the United States that specialize in the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis. We believe that we will be able to market reproxalap to those centers with a small number of medical science liaisons. 
 There are many ocular inflammatory diseases that are treated with topical ocular corticosteroids, including scleritis, post-operative inflammation, graft versus host disease, blepharitis, and cyclitis. In 2016, total sales of topical ocular corticosteroids were approximately $800 million in the United States. Given the potential safety advantages over corticosteroids, reproxalap and similar product candidates have the potential to be first-line treatment options for corticosteroid-responsive diseases in the United States, assuming sufficient clinical testing required to receive FDA marketing approval. 
 Systemic Autoimmune Disease 
 Autoimmune diseases are generally chronic systemic conditions characterized by excessive and misdirected inflammatory responses to host proteins. In aggregate, autoimmune diseases and related systemic inflammatory disorders represent tens of millions of patients in the United States. Sales of drugs for autoimmune disease are expected to exceed $100 billion in 2020. In 2016, three of the top five highest-selling drugs, totaling approximately $33 billion in U.S. sales, were prescribed for a variety of inflammatory disorders, including Crohns disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The potential market for immune-modulating therapies could continue to expand, since excessive inflammation may be critical to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and many other conditions that are not typically defined as inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. 
 Given the complex pathophysiology of systemic inflammatory disorders, many of which are caused by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, therapy often requires combinations of drugs with distinct mechanisms of action. Thus, we believe, novel product candidates for inflammation are in high demand. 
 Because RASP appear to be involved in the generation and potentiation of inflammation in general, we believe the potential therapeutic applicability of RASP scavengers is broad. We are not aware of any other company actively developing RASP scavengers, although we have partnered with Johnson & Johnson to develop novel RASP sequestering agents for the treatment of systemic inflammatory disease. Thus, the RASP scavenger platform represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for a variety of common inflammatory conditions. 
 ADX-1612 (investigated in oncology under the name ganetespib) is a novel drug candidate that inhibits Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 is involved in the processing of a variety of proteins, and appears to be particularly important in cellular proliferation. Many inflammatory diseases are at least in part the result of hyper-proliferation of immune cells, a phenomenon known as lymphoproliferation, which is related to immune cell cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma. Lymphoproliferative diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and myelodysplastic syndromes. We are not aware of any other company that is developing an HSP90 inhibitor for systemic inflammatory disease. We expect to begin clinical testing of ADX-1612 in lymphoproliferative disease in 2019. 
 
8 


 Retinal Disease 
 The retina is the light-sensing aspect of the eye, and is particularly sensitive to a variety of perturbations, including inflammation. Even minor pathological changes can result in significant vision loss. Thus, retinal therapy commands premium pricing, and, in aggregate, therapies for retinal disease represent one of the largest ocular pharmaceutical markets. 
 RASP and other toxic aldehydes are implicated in a variety of retinal diseases. Inflammatory retinal disorders that involve RASP include posterior uveitis, panuveitis, uveitis-associated macular edema, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy. Separately, aldehydes and aldehyde-adduct aggregates accumulate in dry age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt Disease (juvenile dry age-related macular degeneration-like disease), and Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome-associated maculopathy. We believe that the number of patients affected by retinal disorders is considerable. For example, diabetic retinopathy and dry age-related macular edema represent approximately 19 million patients in the United States. 
 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome 
 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in an enzyme that metabolizes fatty aldehydes, resulting in severe skin, neurological, and retinal disorders. Genetic mutation analysis suggests that there are approximately 1,000 SLS patients in the United States. 
 The primary day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers is ichthyosis, a severe skin disease characterized by thick, scaly, dry, flaking, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. SLS patients are consistently disturbed by pruritus and often excoriate skin by scratching. The scales that accumulate on the surface of the skin are subject to bacterial overgrowth, which results in an unpleasant odor that is associated with some SLS patients. The ichthyosis in SLS affects most of the body, generally sparing only the face, palms, and soles. Considerable social stigma and emotional burden is common, especially given scale odor, the flaking skin, and the external perception that SLS patients suffer from diffuse cutaneous infectious disease. There is currently no specific therapy approved for the treatment of the dermatologic disease in SLS, though some patients and their caregivers apply non-specific topical creams, including keratinolytics (acids that soften skin), moisturizers, and retinoids. We believe that the effects of keratinolytic and moisturizing creams are minimal or non-existent in treating severe ichthyosis, and due to toxicity, retinoids are not suitable for chronic use. 
 The dermatologic disease in SLS is thought to be caused by aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids (fats) that are generated in the epidermis (the most superficial layer of skin) to form a moisture barrier that holds water in the skin. Moisture barrier compromise leads to water loss, which in turn leads to epidermal thickening characteristic of ichthyosis. We believe that by lowering levels of aldehydes and thereby preventing lipid modification and the ensuing moisture barrier dysfunction, reproxalap, when applied topically to the skin, has the potential to ameliorate the dermatologic symptoms of SLS. 
 We have completed a payer survey to assess potential pricing of topical dermatologic reproxalap for the treatment of ichthyosis associated with SLS. During the survey, payers were informed that topical dermatologic reproxalap is unlikely to affect the neurological and retinal aspects of SLS, and that daily lifelong therapy covering 90% of the body surface could be required for disease control. Assuming genetic diagnosis of SLS, payers generally noted that coverage was possible within a range of $200,000 to $400,000 per patient per year. 
 The Competitive Landscape of Our Product Candidates 
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and potential commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, and the ability to reduce the dependence on, or the dose of, more toxic drug products. 
 

9 


 Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining regulatory approval for products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product that we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products non-competitive or obsolete. 
 While our product candidates may manifest efficacy and/or safety advantages, many marketed therapies are generic or may be priced considerably lower than the pricing we anticipate for our product candidates. Pricing factors may discourage the initial or prolonged use of our product candidates. 
 RASP Scavenger Platform 
 A number of academic groups have published on the concept of reducing aldehyde levels, primarily by using compounds with amines (certain nitrogen-containing compounds) that react with aldehydes through a chemical process known as the Schiff base reaction. Various aldehyde-binding amines have been described, particularly carnosine (a naturally occurring dipeptide), which has other potential mechanisms of action unrelated to aldehydes. At least one group has published on the use of certain nitrogen-containing marketed products to temporarily, in a reversible manner, bind retinaldehyde as a potential therapy for retinal disease. Schiff base reactions have also been mentioned as possible explanations for a portion of the activity of aminoguanidine, pyridoxamine, and possibly other non-proprietary amine-containing compounds that have been tested in clinical trials for diabetic nephropathy. However, the Schiff base reaction is reversible, and generally the substrates (precursors) and products of the reaction exist in equilibrium such that at any point in time, the aldehyde substrate may be bound or unbound. In this way, Schiff base reactions alone represent reversible and temporary aldehyde binding, and likely lead to the relocation of aldehydes rather than the elimination of aldehydes. We believe that reproxalap and chemically related product candidates that we have discovered are differentiated from the above approaches in that the chemical structures of our product candidates are novel, and the reaction with aldehydes has been observed to be essentially irreversible in vivo, which we believe may result in a more effective means of diminishing RASP and other toxic aldehyde levels. 
 Other Immune-Modulating Pharmacotherapies 
 A myriad of new treatments have been or are being developed to treat inflammatory diseases, and have been used, or in theory could be used, for the treatment of the diseases that our product candidates are intended to target. Immune-modulating products include cytokine inhibitors, immune cell receptor inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Companies that currently market such therapies include Abbvie, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, UCB Inc. and UCB S.A., Amgen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and Pfizer, Inc. Currently marketed products may manifest efficacy and safety advantages over our product candidates, and may be used to treat the diseases for which we are developing our product candidates. 
Competitive Product Candidates by Indication 
 The pharmaceutical industry focused on immune-mediated disease is highly competitive and includes a number of established large and mid-sized companies with significantly greater financial, technical, commercial, and personnel resources than we have. Our market segment also includes smaller emerging companies whose activities may be directly focused on our target markets and areas of expertise. Our products, if approved for commercial use, will compete with a variety of generic and proprietary treatments offered by these competitors, depending on the approved indication. While we believe that our products may have certain favorable features, existing and new treatments may also possess advantages. Additionally, the development of other drug technologies and methods of disease prevention are occurring at a rapid pace, potentially rendering our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 
10 


 We believe the primary competitors by indication with respect to our current programs in late stage-clinical testing are as follows: 
 Competitive Pharmaceuticals by Indication 
 

Indication | Competitive Products 
Dry Eye Disease | Topical immunomodulators (cyclosporine, lifitegrast), topical corticosteroids, artificial tear solutions 
Allergic Conjunctivitis | Topical antihistamines and corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mast cell stabilizers
Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis | Topical corticosteroids 
Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome | Retinoids, keratinolytics, and moisturizers 

 We believe that there is significant unmet medical need for the diseases that we intend to study. If proven to be safe and effective, we believe that our product candidates could be used in place of or in addition to current therapies. Currently available therapy for the treatment of dry eye disease is generally considered by physicians and patients to be inadequate, may require weeks or months of treatment to achieve even moderate clinical benefit, and has not demonstrated clinical activity in allergic dry eye disease. Topical antihistamines for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis are not effective for all patients, in part due to lack of durable activity following exposure to allergen and, in addition, exacerbation of ocular dryness. Topical corticosteroids for noninfectious anterior uveitis and other ocular inflammatory diseases are often associated with toxicity, including glaucoma, cataracts, and ocular infection. There is no approved therapy for SLS, and we believe that the current non-specific creams and medications for SLS are poorly effective, if effective at all. 
 Many drugs are in development for allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease. Novartis/Alcon (ESBA105, LME636) and EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (EGP-437) have conducted or are conducting clinical trials in anterior uveitis. For the diseases we intend to study, there may be other developmental therapies of which we are not aware. We believe that there are no drugs in development specifically for ADED or SLS. 
 Our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our ability to utilize our drug development expertise to identify, develop, secure rights to, and obtain regulatory approvals for promising pharmaceutical products before others are able to develop competitive products. Our ability to compete successfully will also depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. Additionally, our ability to compete may be affected because insurers and other third-party payors in some cases seek to encourage the use of cheaper, generic products, which could make our products less attractive. 
 Clinical Trial Results and Development Plans 
 Prior to marketing, our product candidates must satisfy regulatory authority requirements for safety and efficacy, including pivotal Phase 3 clinical assessment. Our active clinical programs with reproxalap have consistently demonstrated statistically and clinically significant efficacy, as well as acceptable safety and tolerability, and have advanced to late-stage clinical testing. Our material clinical results have been disclosed elsewhere in detail, and we encourage review of all clinical trial disclosures. Our program in dry eye disease has begun Phase 2b clinical testing. Our program in noninfectious anterior uveitis has begun Phase 3 clinical testing, and our programs in allergic conjunctivitis and SLS are expected to begin Phase 3 clinical testing in the first half of 2018. All of our development timelines may be subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory review, preclinical and clinical results, and other factors that could delay the initiation, completion, or reporting of clinical trials.

 Dry Eye Disease 
 In September 2017, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked Phase 2a clinical trial of reproxalap ophthalmic solution demonstrated statistically and clinically relevant improvement from baseline in multiple signs and symptoms associated with dry eye disease. Fifty-one patients with moderate dry eye disease were randomized equally to receive either topical ocular reproxalap 0.1%, topical ocular reproxalap 0.5%, or topical ocular reproxalap 0.5% lipid formulation for 28 days, four times daily. Changes from baseline were assessed for standard dry eye disease signs and symptoms. Pooled results from all groups indicated statistically significant improvement from baseline in Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) Score, Ocular Discomfort Score, Overall Four-Symptom Score, Schirmer (Tear Volume) Test, tear osmolarity, and Lissamine Green ocular surface staining score. A modest dose-response was observed, and activity increased over time from Day 8 to Day 28, supportive of drug activity. Levels of malondialdehyde, a RASP mediator sequestered by reproxalap, were significantly reduced in the tears of patients, supportive of the differentiated mechanism of action of reproxalap relative to other therapies in dry eye disease. 
 The primary objective of the trial was to select a formulation and dose range for a Phase 2b clinical trial. Based on consistent statistically and clinically significant activity across multiple sign and symptom endpoints, and tolerability consistent with that of standard of care, topical ocular reproxalap 0.1% was nominated for advancement. Relative to baseline, improvement after 28 days of topical ocular reproxalap 0.1% therapy (see figure below) was statistically significant or approached statistical significance for Ocular Discomfort Score, the dryness component of the Four-Symptom Score, Overall Four-Symptom Score, SANDE Score, Schirmer Test, tear osmolarity, and tear aldehyde levels. Effect sizes for topical ocular reproxalap 0.1% generally correlated with clinical significance for patient-reported outcomes. 
 Dry Eye Disease Phase 2a Clinical Trial Reproxalap 0.1% Effect Sizes for Signs and Symptoms 
 

In January 2018, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 2b clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap for the treatment of dry eye disease (www.clinicaltrials.gov #NCT03404115). The trial is expected to enroll 300 patients with moderate dry eye disease, randomized equally to receive either topical ocular reproxalap 0.1%, topical ocular reproxalap 0.25%, or vehicle four times daily for 12 weeks. Standard dry eye disease signs and symptoms will be assessed. We expect to report the results of the Phase 2b trial in the second half of 2018. 
Allergic Conjunctivitis 
 In February 2016, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of reproxalap ophthalmic solution in patients with allergic conjunctivitis demonstrated statistically and clinically significant activity of reproxalap over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing. 
 
12 


 In June 2017, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap in patients with allergic conjunctivitis demonstrated statistically and clinically significant activity of reproxalap over vehicle in reducing ocular itching. Using the conjunctival allergen challenge model (CAC), 154 healthy men and women with a history of allergic conjunctivitis were randomized in equal groups for treatment with topical ocular reproxalap 0.5%, topical ocular reproxalap 0.1%, or vehicle, and ocular inflammation was induced by exposure to allergen. For subjects challenged with seasonal allergens, the results demonstrated statistically significant activity of reproxalap over vehicle in reducing patient-reported ocular itching (scale 0 to 4) after a single dose. Responders were defined as subjects who improved two points from their baseline ocular itch score. The time to response vs. vehicle was statistically faster in 0.1% (p=0.02) and 0.5% (p=0.04, see figure below) reproxalap groups for subjects challenged with seasonal allergens. Reproxalap was generally well tolerated and there were no safety concerns observed during the trial. 
 Allergic Conjunctivitis Phase 2b Clinical Trial Two-Point Responder Analysis for Patient-Reported Ocular Itching Following a Single Dose of Topical Ocular 0.5% Reproxalap vs. Vehicle 
 

In the second quarter of 2018, we expect to begin a planned Phase 3 CAC clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. The trial is expected to enroll up to 300 patients, randomized equally to receive a single dose of either topical ocular reproxalap 0.25%, topical ocular reproxalap 0.5%, or vehicle. Endpoints will include ocular itch score area under the curve and two-point ocular itch score response from baseline. We expect to report the results of the Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2018, or early 2019. 
 Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis 
 In May 2016, we announced that the results of our randomized, parallel-group, investigator-masked, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of reproxalap ophthalmic solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis demonstrated that reproxalap reduced inflammatory cell count in the anterior chamber of the eye to a degree similar to that of standard-of-care corticosteroid therapy (which may lead to cataracts and glaucoma in some patients), but without the intraocular pressure elevations that were observed in subjects treated with corticosteroids. Forty-five subjects were randomized equally to receive six weeks of treatment with one of the 
 
13 


  following: reproxalap 0.5% four times daily; Pred Forte® 1% (a corticosteroid) four times daily (tapered); or reproxalap 0.5% four times daily and Pred Forte® 1% two times daily (tapered). The results of the trial demonstrated that the activity of reproxalap was comparable to Pred Forte® in reducing anterior chamber inflammatory cell count (see figure below). At the week 4 visit, grade 0 cell count (zero or one cells) was observed in 53% of reproxalap-treated patients versus 38% of corticosteroid-treated patients. Elevations of intraocular pressure observed in corticosteroid-treated patients were not observed in reproxalap-treated patients (see figure below). Reproxalap was observed to be generally well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events. 
 Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results for Anterior Chamber Cell Count Grade 
 

Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results for Intraocular Pressure (mmHg) 
 

In April 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap 0.5% for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis (www.clinicaltrials.gov #NCT03131154). The trial is expected to enroll up to 100 patients, randomized equally to receive either topical ocular reproxalap 0.5% or vehicle for four weeks. The primary endpoint is time to zero inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. We expect to report results from the Phase 3 clinical trial in 2019. 
 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome 
 In August 2016, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial of a dermatologic formulation of reproxalap for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS demonstrated clinically relevant activity of reproxalap in diminishing the severity of ichthyosis, a serious dermatologic disease characteristic of SLS. Twelve SLS patients with moderate to severe ichthyosis were randomized equally to receive reproxalap 1% dermatologic formulation or vehicle formulation administered once daily on a 4 x 10 inch area of skin for two months. Ichthyosis was graded by a blinded central review of digital photographs, as well as by clinical exam, using the Ichthyosis Severity Score, which is comprised of assessments 
 
14 


  of global impression, scaling, erythema (redness), lichenification (thickness) and excoriation (abrasion). As assessed by central review, five of six subjects (83%) treated with reproxalap achieved a rating of almost clear or mild on global assessment. Six of six (100%) subjects treated with reproxalap improved over the course of therapy as assessed by central review (p < 0.05, see figure below), and the improvement was greater than that observed with vehicle-treated patients (p < 0.05). For reproxalap-treated subjects, mean reductions in ichthyosis severity were greater after eight weeks of therapy than after four weeks of therapy, suggesting a disease modifying effect of reproxalap. Reproxalap was observed to be generally well tolerated, and there were no significant adverse events, serious adverse events, or discontinuations in the trial. 
 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results for Each Reproxalap-Treated Patient as Assessed by Central Review 
 

In the second quarter of 2018, we expect to begin a planned two-part Phase 3 clinical trial of topical dermatologic reproxalap for the treatment of ichthyosis associated with SLS. Part 1 of the trial is expected to enroll nine patients, randomized 2:1 to receive either topical dermatologic reproxalap 1% or vehicle, respectively, for six months. Body surface area coverage will escalate from 20% to 90% over the course of treatment. The primary endpoint will be ichthyosis scaling in drug-treated patients, as assessed by the Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity, a scoring system similar to the Ichthyosis Severity Score. Part 2 of the trial will be powered based on the results Part 1. The design of Part 2 will be similar to that of Part 1, except that 90% of the body surface area will be treated for six months. We expect to report the results of Part 1 of the Phase 3 trial in 2019. 
The Science Supporting Our Product Candidates 
 Pro-Inflammatory Reactive Aldehyde Species and Other Toxic Aldehyde Molecules 
 In response to infection and other stimuli, pro-inflammatory reactive aldehyde species (RASP) are generated through a variety of metabolic processes, including alcohol oxidation, enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipid oxidation, and sphingosine metabolism. RASP appear to effect inflammation signaling via covalent binding to thiol and amine residues on proteins, including receptors and enzymes. RASP-protein adducts directly influence the function of proteins, leading the activation of intracellular inflammatory factors, including NF-kB, an important mediator in the inflammatory response. In addition, RASP adducts bind to Scavenger Receptor A, which also initiates pro-inflammatory signaling and leads to the formation of antibodies against the adducted protein, at least in part explaining the presence of host-directed antibodies in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Levels of RASP are generally observed to be elevated in ocular and systemic inflammatory disease, and thus represent therapeutic targets for immune-modulation.

 Because of the inherent toxicity of aldehyde-containing molecules, most, if not all, living organisms contain enzymes, such as aldehyde reductases and aldehyde dehydrogenases, that convert aldehydes into non-toxic molecules. Genetic mutations in the aldehyde-metabolizing enzymes cause disease. In SLS, mutations in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase are responsible for skin, neurological, and retinal disease. In particular, ichthyosis, the severe skin disease associated with SLS, is thought to be due to fatty aldehyde binding to epidermal fats that prevent moisture loss, leading to thick, scaly, dry, flaking, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. 
 Aside from the stimulation of inflammation, there is no generally accepted biological role of high levels of aldehydes. Some physiologic molecules have aldehyde forms, including retinaldehyde (a form of Vitamin A) and pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate (forms of Vitamin B6), but the activity of these aldehydes is highly restricted by chaperone and other proteins that prevent reaction with other molecules, including our RASP scavengers. Thus, pharmacotherapeutic RASP and other aldehyde sequestration is expected not to adversely affect normal physiologic processes. Consistent with the lack of accessibility of chaperoned physiologic aldehyde-containing molecules, our most advanced aldehyde scavenger, reproxalap, which has been administered to over 250 subjects across six clinical trials, has been observed to be generally well tolerated and has not resulted in any serious adverse events. 
 The RASP Scavenger Platform 
 We are currently developing reproxalap, a new chemical entity, and other novel RASP scavengers for the treatment of inflammatory disease. Reproxalap is a small molecule designed specifically to sequester, and thereby allow for the degradation of, RASP and other toxic aldehyde-containing molecules. In in vitro and animal studies, reproxalap does not appear to affect most cellular components, including most receptors, enzymes, ion channels, or other proteins. Reproxalap has been shown to outcompete cellular constituents to covalently bind and trap RASP. Reproxalap-aldehyde adducts appear to be rapidly degraded in cellular environments, after which neither reproxalap nor RASP are detectable. Outside of biological systems, reproxalap-RASP adducts have shown to be remarkably non-reactive and stable, suggesting that reproxalap-RASP binding may be effectively irreversible. By forming covalent drug-RASP adducts that are then degraded, reproxalap and other RASP scavengers have the potential to substantially lower RASP levels. 
 We believe we have been the first to demonstrate the beneficial effects of RASP scavenging in a variety of animal models relating to inflammation, suggesting that reproxalap and analogs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects that persist hours after administration at a variety of different doses relevant to clinical testing. 
 

 | In mouse models of ocular inflammation and post-surgical healing, topically applied reproxalap ophthalmic solution reduced ocular redness and inflammatory cytokines comparable to corticosteroid therapy and slowed the development of corneal haze (fibrosis). (Data presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology 2015 Annual Meeting)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In mice injected with a pro-inflammatory agent known as endotoxin, intraperitoneally administered reproxalap statistically reduced a variety of inflammatory cytokines (protein inflammatory mediators), including IL-5, Il-1ß, IL-17, and TNF-a, while up-regulating the primary anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Additionally, in models of mouse contact dermatitis (induced by phorbol myristate acetate) and allergic contact dermatitis (induced by sensitivity to oxazolone), reproxalap statistically reduced inflammation as measured by edema (swelling). (Data presented at the American Academy of Asthma Allergy and Immunology 2015 Annual Meeting)

 | In two different mouse models of inflammatory pain, intraperitoneally administered reproxalap dose-dependently reduced nociceptive behavior, suggesting that reproxalap down-regulates pain signaling in inflammation.

 | In rat cardiomyocyte culture, reproxalap prevented fibrotic transformation, and inhibited NF-kB activation and IL-1ß release. (Data presented at the 2016 American Society for Cell Biology Annual Meeting)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thus, we believe that the mechanism of action of RASP scavenging is potentially multifactorial  lowering inflammation, reducing healing time, diminishing scarring, and mitigating inflammatory pain  and may ameliorate inflammatory disease and deter disease progression in different ways simultaneously. 
 In addition to the development of reproxalap, we intend to continue the discovery and development of other novel RASP scavengers, and we intend to continue to develop intellectual property around such molecules. We have identified, synthesized, and tested numerous molecules that may be more potent than reproxalap in sequestering RASP. We are currently screening novel product candidates to address diseases where topical and systemic administration is applicable to reduce RASP-mediated pathology. We have nominated two new RASP scavengers, ADX-103 and ADX-629, for clinical development, which may begin in 2019, depending on additional preclinical data, regulatory discussions, funding, and other factors. 
 The Immune Modulating Activity of HSP90 Inhibition 
 In December 2016, we licensed rights to ADX-1612 for the treatment of all diseases, and we intend to focus development on systemic inflammatory disease, particularly lymphoproliferative diseases. ADX-1612 is a novel, highly potent small molecule HSP90 inhibitor that has completed numerous clinical trials in oncologic diseases. HSP90 is a protein involved in the processing of other proteins that are critical for physiologic cellular function. Inhibition of HSP90 leads to diminished cellular replication. We intend to develop ADX-1612 for the treatment of one or more systemic lymphoproliferative inflammatory diseases where excessive immune cell replication leads to inflammation, organomegaly, and other pathologies. ADX-1612 appears to be reasonably well tolerated at doses that may be sufficient to diminish immune cell replication. 
 HSP90 is elevated in autoimmune disease, and is believed to lead to broad activation of the immune system. Preclinical results have shown the potential of ADX-1612 to diminish inflammatory cytokines, immune cell numbers, autoantibody formation, and lymphadenopathy (pathologic swelling of the lymph glands, in part due to immune cell hyper-proliferation). In addition, ADX-1612 appears to preserve organ function in animal models of autoimmune disease. The immune-modulating potential of ADX-1612 was observed clinically in a patient treated for Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia, in whom resolution of vasculitis (a systemic autoimmune disease) occurred during treatment. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 Overview 
 We are building an intellectual property portfolio for reproxalap and other RASP scavengers in the United States and abroad. We currently seek, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, methods of use, and processes for manufacture, and for other technologies, where appropriate. Our current policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on, and will continue to rely on, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 
17 


 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, our ability to defend our patents, and our ability to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Patent Portfolio 
 Our patent portfolio currently includes patents and patent applications covering the composition, formulation, and uses of reproxalap, ADX-103, ADX-629, ADX-1612, and other novel compounds. As of December 31, 2017, we owned nine United States patents and five pending United States non-provisional patent applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts to these patents and patent applications, relating to reproxalap, ADX-103 and ADX-629. Additionally, we have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to ADX-1612. We expect the issued reproxalap composition of matter patent in the United States, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2028. It is possible that the term of the composition of matter patent in the United States may be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect the foreign reproxalap composition of matter patents, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2026. We expect other patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2026 to 2034. Reproxalap composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe (validated in approximately 14 member countries), Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia and South Korea. Reproxalap composition of matter patent claims are pending in Brazil. 
Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 Our marks ALDEYRA THERAPEUTICS and our logo are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 
 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We currently require and will continue to require each of our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of such individuals employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from such individuals work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed by a consultant for us. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We have no immediate plans to purchase, erect, or otherwise create any manufacturing facilities to be owned by us for any of these purposes, and intend to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production at such time. We may utilize third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors. We believe that the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials needed for the formulation of our product candidates are relatively easy to manufacture, and that multiple suppliers and formulators could be employed for this purpose. Further, we believe the raw materials needed for manufacture of our product candidates, as well as other components of our formulations, are generally readily available currently from multiple sources. 
 
18 


 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 12 full time employees and had engaged a number of consultants. We intend to increase our employee base in connection with the continuing clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that a number of consultants previously engaged in development of our product candidates will participate in ongoing clinical and manufacturing activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs good laboratory practice (GLP) regulation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices (cGCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection(s) of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Preclinical 
 
19 


  testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a partial or complete clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if the potential for unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The investigational drug product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: The investigational drug product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations suggest that certain dosing regimens may be efficacious and may have an acceptable safety profile, trials may be undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage and to obtain evidence of potential clinical efficacy and safety. These studies may include multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. Data generated from these studies may be used to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the investigational drug product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product, if approved.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsors agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the products safety and/or effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be 
 
20 


  recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA and does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it was studied, the sponsor will be entitled to seven years of product marketing exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited and rare circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease, the competitors exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years, unless superior safety or efficacy of our drug is demonstrated. 
 For some products, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as prescribing restrictions, requirements for post-marketing studies and reporting or certain restrictions on distribution and use. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to prescription drug program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe after acceptance of filing. A Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months after acceptance of filing. 
 It is likely that our product candidates will be granted a Standard Review. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In addition, for combination products, the FDAs review may include the participation of both the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This has the potential to complicate or prolong review of the application. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the drug substance or drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 
21 


 Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if potential adverse safety findings are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 Products may be promoted only for the approved labeled indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms, such as a Black Box Warning, which highlights a specific warning. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company would be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require such company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations may also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and may impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated seriousness, severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. Physicians may prescribe for off-label uses; manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 
22 


 The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drugs risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategys approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drugs benefits outweigh its risks. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDAs cGMP regulations and, if applicable, quality system regulation requirements for medical devices. The cGMP 
 
23 


  regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA and may be subject to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. There are evolving legal requirements and other statutory and regulatory regimes that will continue to affect our business. 
Research and Development Expenses 
 Substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date have been related to the development of reproxalap and our other product candidates. Our research and development expenses totaled $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 We anticipate that we will incur additional research and development expenses in the future as we evaluate and possibly pursue the development of our product candidates for additional indications, or develop additional product candidates. 
 We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:

 We expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred. 
 We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future non-clinical, preclinical and clinical development programs. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in terms of both their timing and total cost to completion. We expect to continue to develop stable formulations of our product candidates, test such formulations in preclinical studies for toxicology, safety and efficacy and to conduct clinical trials for each product candidate. We anticipate funding clinical trials for our product candidates ourselves, but we may engage collaboration partners at certain stages of clinical development. As we obtain results from clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials by us or our future collaborators may take several years or more, the length of time generally varying with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to but not limited to the following: 
 

 | the number of sites included in the trials;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | the number of patients that participate in the trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | the number of doses that patients receive;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | the duration of patient follow-up;
--+-----------------------------------


 | the phase of development the product candidate is in; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones. Expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. 
 None of our product candidates have received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval. In order to grant marketing approval, a health authority such as the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical and preclinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates with an appropriate benefit to risk profile relevant to a particular indication, and that the product can be manufactured under cGMP in a reproducible manner to deliver the products intended performance in terms of its stability, quality, purity and potency. Until our submission is reviewed by a health authority, there is no way to predict the outcome of their review. Even if the clinical studies meet their predetermined primary endpoints, and a registration dossier is accepted for filing, a health authority could still determine that an appropriate benefit to risk relationship does not exist for the indication that we are seeking. 
 We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements.

 As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate.
