Item 1. Business
Overview
 
NutraLife BioSciences, Inc. (“us”, “we” or the “Company”) was founded in 2010 by Edgar Ward, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President & Director to engage in the development, manufacturing and distribution of nutritional and dietary oral spray products. Since then the Company has evolved into a branded and private label developer, manufacturer and distributor of a wide range of nutraceutical, wellness, and CBD products. The Company’s revenues increased from $225,293 in 2016 to $3,711,327 in 2018.
 
The Company’s manufacturing facility has been registered with the Food and Drug Administration and its manufacturing facility has operated in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Processes Standard (GMP) for more than five years. Our products adhere to high manufacturing standards throughout every step of the manufacturing and extraction process. Our products are formulated, developed, manufactured and produced under the supervision of Edgar Ward, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director. Once produced our products are tested by our in-house laboratory chemists. Our nutraceutical and industrial CBD products are of the highest-quality and laboratory tested for strength, purity and contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and solvents. 
 
We offer thirteen (13) different core formulations which we modify to meet the specifications of our private label customers. We provide approximately 50 different variations of our core formulations. Our private label products include CBD-infused oral sprays, tinctures, pet drops, pain balms, and face creams, and nutraceutical oral spray products for sleep support and weight loss packaged under the customer’s brand names. 
 
Our spray products and tinctures are available in various formulations and strengths and are available for purchase online directly from the Company through its website at www.nutralifebiosciences.com, as well as through numerous other private label distributors, online retailers and retail outlets.

Bankruptcy, Receivership or Similar Proceedings
 
We have not been involved in a bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding. Additionally, we have not been involved in a reclassification, merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
Our Business
 
We are a manufacturer and distributor of nutraceutical, dietary, wellness and other products. Our products are sold to private label distributors who sell the products we manufacture under their own brand names as well as under our own brand names. 
 
For the years ending on December 31, of 2017 and 2018, we generated revenues of $1,790,168 and $3,711,327, respectively from the sale of our products.
 
In March of 2017, we began selling CBD products. Since that time, revenues from sales of our CBD products increased from approximately $1,380,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2,400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 representing 77% and 78% of our revenues for such periods. 
 
Our Products and Services
 
We manufacture and distribute private label and branded products. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, private label sales represented 91% and 99% of our revenue, respectively. 
 
Our Products
 
Our CBD products are derived from the seeds and mature stalks of the Cannabis Sativa plant which includes all parts and varieties of the cannabis sativa plant also known as hemp, which contain a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (“THC”) that does not exceed 0.3 percent on a dry-weight basis. In December of 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed an evaluation of three generally recognized as safe (GRAS) notices for hemp seed-derived food ingredients. The FDA stated that hulled hemp seed (GRN765), hemp seed protein powder (GRN771), and hemp seed oil (GRN778) are GRAS under their intended conditions of use. Our CBD products are made from seeds and mature stalks of hemp and contain only trace amounts of THC, we believe they qualify as GRAS products. 
 Our CBD products include:
 


· | Cannabinoid-rich hemp oil derived from industrial hemp 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Tinctures 
· | Topical lotions and oils applied directly to the skin designed to treat pain or inflammation
· | Face creams 
· | Massage oils 
· | Nutraceutical Sprays with CBD as an added ingredient 
· | Pet products taken internally 

 
Our branded products include NutraHemp CBD products including oral sprays, tinctures, pet drops, pain balms, and face creams and NutraSpray oral spray products for sleep support and an appetite suppressant.
 
Recent Developments
 
In November of 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary PAT began providing bulk material analytical, identity, potency and purity testing of raw industrial hemp.

In January of 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, NutraDerma acquired the patent for a natural dermal skin patch that is designed to prevent mosquito and other insect bites. 
 
In March of 2019, we licensed our technology for a unique system for pharmaceutical grade delivery of testosterone into the human body to licensed pharmacist, Orlando Pharmacy.
 
Our Operating Strategy
 
We believe a number of current industry trends will increase demand for private label products particularly in the industrial hemp CBD market. Our operating strategy consists of the following key elements:

· | We purchase raw materials and produce goods only upon receipt of a firm commitment from our private label customers and we require payment in full prior to shipping. Once a product is shipped to a customer, we generally do not accept returns unless the product is defective or delivered late. These practices minimize our need to carry unsold inventories. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We regularly update our product line to keep up with consumer trends and industry developments. 
· | We provide superior customer service by controlling the entire production process of our products. By controlling the production process, we have the ability to tailor products to a customer's specific needs, offer customers rapid order turn around time, maintain flexible scheduling and maintain higher standards of quality control. 
· | We seek to add value to customers' overall merchandising effort. We work closely with our customers to develop distinctive product lines at their particular price points. This process allows our customers to achieve a degree of differentiation from their retail competitors. We believe our ability to develop, manufacture and offer high quality, all-natural products is a competitive advantage and will lead to increased orders.
· | We emphasize the development of long-term relationships with our customers by providing a high level of customer service through our sales force. We seek to capitalize on our knowledgeable and experienced sales force by maintaining regular interaction with our customers which provides us with an understanding of which products will meet their particular needs. 

Our Growth Strategy
 
We intend to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 


· | We plan to continue to brand ourselves as a High Quality GMP Compliant manufacturer of industrial hemp CBD products. Many manufacturers of CBD based products do not operate in compliance with GMP standards. All of our CBD products are tested at multiple stages of the production process to ensure product quality and a THC content of less than 0.3%. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We will seek to increase sales to our existing customers by expanding sales of additional products. Certain of our customers began their relationship with us by purchasing only one of our products. Since these initial purchases, we have been able to expand our sales to such customers to multiple products. This strategy has enabled us to expand our product sales to our existing customers over time. We aggressively pursue these cross-selling opportunities. Our range of products enables us to pursue many of these cross-selling opportunities.
· | We seek to increase sales to customers by offering products in categories outside of our traditional product offerings. In November of 2018, through our wholly owned subsidiary PAT, we began providing bulk material analytical, identity, potency and purity testing of raw hemp. In 2019, we plan to commercialize a patented all-natural dermal skin patch that prevents mosquito and other insect bites. Through our wholly owned subsidiary PhytoChem, we plan to provide hemp cultivation and raw bulk material extraction and processing. 
· | We plan to leverage our sales, reputation for quality all-natural products to expand our customer base to other private label customers within the industrial hemp CBD and Nutraceutical markets.

Our Customers
 
Our private label sales represent 21 different brands of products manufactured by us. Sales to private label customers represented approximately 91% and 99% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our industrial hemp CBD products represented 77% and 78% of private label sales in the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. 
 
Our private label products are sold primarily to five (5) private-label distributors, 3 Point Ops, NF Skin, Organic by Nature, My Daily Choice, and Oxzgen, which represented 32%, 25%, 17%, 13%, and 4% percent of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
We do not enter into long term contracts with our private label distributors and all sales are made by purchase order. Our private label customers are not obligated to order a minimum amount of product from us and can discontinue purchasing our product at any time.
 
We believe our private label products offer numerous benefits to our customers:
 


· | Our private label products as less expensive than brand name products, but of equal or better quality. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our private label products offer the opportunity for higher profit margins than brand name products. 
· | Distributing private label products builds brand recognition for the retail as well as the wholesale customer. 
· | We are registered with the FDA and follow GMP in the manufacturing process ensuring high quality products and consistent standards for our private label customers.
· | Businesses using our private label products avoid the additional expense of manufacturing and creating the finished product. 
· | Our private label customers are able to focus their attention and resources on their business and not on manufacturing a final product. 
· | We offer high quality unique products with enhanced delivery systems that are effective and appealing to consumers 
· | We offer a wide range of private label products providing our customers with a variety of options. 
· | Private label customers have the convenience of ordering our products online. 

Manufacturing
 
Once developed, our products are manufactured at our facility in Coconut Creek, Florida. We obtain all raw materials and ingredients for our products from third party suppliers. For all orders we receive, we manufacture, package, label and ship the product to the customer. We lease an aggregate of six thousand four hundred (6,400) square feet of office and warehouse space at 6601 Lyons Rd, Suites L-6&7, Coconut Creek, Florida 33073. Approximately five thousand eight hundred (5,800) square feet at this location is used for manufacturing, storage and distribution of our products. 

7

 
On June 6, 2017, we entered into an agreement to lease nineteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-one (19,831) square feet in Deerfield Beach, FL 33441. We plan to use seventeen thousand eight hundred (17,800) square feet of the new Deerfield Beach location for manufacturing, storage and distribution of our products. We expect to begin manufacturing at this location in June of 2019.
 
By manufacturing our own products, we believe that we maintain better control over product quality and availability while also reducing production costs. Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following operations: (a) sourcing ingredients for products, (b) warehousing raw ingredients, (c) efficacy testing and measuring ingredients for inclusion in products, and (d) blending using automatic equipment. The next step, bottling and packaging, involves filling, capping, coding, labeling and placing the product in packaging with appropriate tamper-evident features then sending the packaged product to our customers.
 
The Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requires companies manufacturing homeopathic medicines to have their facilities certified as Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMPs"). Our manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA and is compliant with its GMP certification. Our quality control program seeks to ensure the superior quality of our products and that they are manufactured in accordance with current GMP. Our processing methods are monitored closely to ensure that only quality ingredients are used and to ensure product purity. Periodically, we retain the services of outside GMP audit firms to assist us in our efforts to comply with GMPs.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The raw materials for our industrial hemp CBD products consist of Cannabidiol rich oil and isolate. We obtain the raw materials for our industrial hemp CBD products from state licensed suppliers. We obtain the raw materials for our other non-CBD based products from several ingredient suppliers located in the U.S. These raw materials consist of naturally derived vitamins and nutrients. The raw materials used by us are available from a variety of suppliers. We maintain a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate their relationship with us in the near term. We have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event, we are unable to obtain any of our raw materials from our suppliers; we believe that we could obtain alternative sources of any raw materials from other suppliers. We do not have contracts with our suppliers and we order our raw materials on an as needed basis. We have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply of raw materials could adversely affect our business derived from these products.
Shipping and Delivery of Finished Products
 
Upon completion of the manufacturing process, our products are shipped directly to customers. Private label products are packaged by us in the packaging provided by each customer. All shipping, bills of lading and invoices are generated by us from our Coconut Creek, Florida facility.
 
We ship the product ordered within forty-five (45) days to our private label distributors, thirty (30) days to retail customers and within thirty (30) days to wholesale and third party (non-private label) distributors. All orders are shipped by freight delivery at the cost of the customer. We require a deposit of fifty percent (50%) upon an order being placed from our private label customers and the balance prior to shipping. Our retail customers must pay for their order at the time that the order is placed.

Product Development & Quality
 
We have in place comprehensive quality control procedures to ensure that raw materials and finished goods meet our exacting quality standards. Each product we offer is based upon the research of Edgar Ward, our Chief Executive Officer, President, and sole Director, with the assistance of our in-house chemists. Our products are and, in the future, will continue to be identified by Mr. Ward based upon suggestions from our customers, and from industry and market research he conducts on an ongoing basis. We do not employ medical professionals and our management does not have experience in the healthcare industry or in the treatment of disease. Our products have not been confirmed in any respect by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other governmental agency and may not produce the results intended. In developing products, we require:

· | ingredients that are supported with a certificate of analysis, publicly available scientific research and references which our Chief Executive Officer reviews with our in-house chemists who assist in developing our final products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ingredients that are combined so that their effectiveness is not impaired; 
· | the CBD contained in our products is less than .3% and all other ingredients are in dosage levels that fall within tolerable upper intake levels established for healthy people by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and products with hemp;
· | our products do not contain adulterated ingredients such as ephedra, androstenedione, aspartame, steroids, or human growth hormones; and 
· | our formulations that have a minimum of one-year shelf life. 

Sales and Marketing
 
Our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, Edgar Ward actively participates in the planning of our marketing and selling efforts. We employ 1 in house sales representative and use the services independent sales representatives on a commission basis. This sales structure enables us to effectively control our costs and sales efforts. 

 
We use web based marketing to promote our brands and products including social media and promotion of our website at www.nutralifebiosciences.com. Our websites provide useful information about our industry, new developments and our products and allows visitors to order our retail and wholesale wellness, nutraceutical and CBD products. We use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) on an ongoing basis to drive traffic to our website and social media pages and enhance our presence on major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo.
 
We emphasize the development of long-term relationships with our customers. We have established strong relationships with individual buyers at each of our private label customers, and more importantly, it has also established relationships with senior management of our key private label customers. 
 
A key component of our ability to achieve long-term relationships is the high level of services that we provide to our customers. Each sales person is responsible for all aspects of a customer's needs, including product samples, obtaining orders, coordinating product selection, monitoring production and delivering finished products. During the production process, such salesperson is responsible for informing the customer about the progress of an order, including any difficulties that might affect delivery time. In this way, we and our customer can make appropriate arrangements regarding any delay or other change in the order. Further, we ensure that multiple salespersons are familiar with each customer account so that they can work cooperatively to assist one another on a reciprocal basis. We believe that this sales management technique provides an advantage over our competitors because it ensures that our customers always have a knowledgeable salesperson available to discuss product orders and related issues.
 

9

 
Our sales force is in constant contact with our customers to develop an understanding of the customers' retail strategies and production requirements. We use this information to provide our customers with products that meet their particular requirements efficiently. We require that our sales force be knowledgeable about all aspects of our products. We believe our knowledgeable sales force enables it to provide our customers immediate feedback as to the various costs and availability of various raw materials, and production times.
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we have approximately twenty-six (26) full-time and part-time employees. Four (4) employees are chemists engaged in product development and testing, four (4) are engaged in executive or administrative capacities, thirteen (13) employees are engaged in manufacturing, packaging or distribution and one (1) is engaged in sales. 
 
From time to time, we employ temporary employees which provides us with flexibility to adjust staffing levels in response to demand. 
 
None of our employees are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees and independent contractors.
 
Return and Refund Policy
 
We will exchange any product found to be defective. A written exchange request must be submitted when a customer returns defective or damaged products. Purchasers can apply for a refund in the full amount of purchased products within ten (10) days of purchase. All shipping fees for product exchanges or returns must be paid by the purchaser. Historically, product returns as a percentage of our net sales have been nominal.
Our Core Marketing Strategy
 
We believe that our marketing mix of social media promotions and search engine optimization is an optimal strategy to increase sales for both our private label and branded products.
Patents and Trademarks
 
We received federal trademark registration for the expression “Spray your way to a healthier day!” that we use, or intend to use, to distinguish ourselves from others. All trademark registrations are protected for an initial period of five (5) years and then are renewable after five (5) years, if still in use, and every ten (10) years thereafter.

NewLeaf Assets LLC
 
On March 10, 2019, we entered into an agreement with NewLeaf Assets, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (“NewLeaf”) as amended, (the “Agreement”) whereby NewLeaf invested an aggregate of $1,380,000 (the “Investment”) in our securities (the “Securities”) as follows:

(d) | On March 15, 2019, NewLeaf invested the sum of $1,000,000; and 
(e) | On March 15, 2019, we issued 13,764,705 common shares, warrants to purchase an additional 10 million common shares at the price of $.20 per share at anytime until March 4, 2022 and an option to purchase an aggregate of 7,647,058 common shares at the aggregate price of $650,000 at any time prior to April 8, 2019.

Competitive Business Conditions
 
The nutritional, dietary supplement and industrial hemp CBD industries are highly competitive. Numerous manufacturers and distributors compete with us for customers throughout the United States selling products to private label customers and retailers such as mass merchandisers, drug store chains, independent pharmacies and health food stores. We are also vulnerable to competition from companies that can manufacture similar products to our products and compete for private label customers. The markets for our products are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of customer service, product quality, pricing and marketing support. 
 
We compete with major private label and broadline brand manufacturers many of which are larger and have access to greater resources than us. Among other factors, competition among private label manufacturers is based upon price. If one or more private label or broadline brand manufacturers significantly reduce their prices in an effort to gain market share, our results of operations or market position could be adversely affected. We also compete with manufacturers of nationally advertised brand name products which are larger and have resources substantially greater than us. In the future, one or more of these companies could seek to compete more directly with us by manufacturing private label products or by significantly lowering the prices of their national brand products. 
 
Many of our indirect competitors are substantially larger, have more experience than us, have longer operating histories, and have materially greater financial and other resources than us.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We are in a business that involves the use of raw materials in a manufacturing process, however, it is unlikely that such materials are likely to result in the violation of any existing environmental rules and/or regulations. Further, we do not own any real property that could lead to liability as a landowner. Therefore, we do not anticipate that there will be any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

12

Product Liability Insurance
 
We maintain commercial liability, including product liability coverage, and property insurance. Our policy provides for a general liability of five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence, and five million dollars ($5,000,000) annual aggregate coverage which includes our main corporate facility. We carry property coverage on our main office facility to cover our legal liability, tenant’s improvements, business property, and inventory.
Regulation of our Hemp Finished Products
 
The sale of our Hemp Finished Products is potentially subject to a complex web of federal and state regulations that are evolving at a rapid rate. The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and, to a lesser extent, the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. These agencies can change their rules at any time. Should we become subject to FDA, DEA or other enforcement proceedings we would have to cease operations.
 
The FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of drugs, food, including dietary supplements, and over-the-counter drugs. 
 
On December 20, 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 also known as the “Farm Bill” was signed into law. The Farm Bill removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, granted the U.S. Department of Agriculture the ability to regulate hemp defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and preserved the right for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the FD&C Act and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. 
 
The FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of drugs, food, including dietary supplements, and over-the-counter drugs and any inclusion of cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, like CBD, in such products would be regulated by the FDA regardless of the source of the cannabis substance, be it hemp or marijuana. 
 
Our CBD products are derived from the seeds and mature stalks of the Cannabis Sativa plant which includes all parts and varieties of the cannabis sativa plant also known as hemp, which contain a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (“THC”) that does not exceed 0.3 percent on a dry-weight basis. In December of 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed an evaluation of three generally recognized as safe (GRAS) notices for hemp seed-derived food ingredients. The FDA stated that hulled hemp seed (GRN765), hemp seed protein powder (GRN771), and hemp seed oil (GRN778) are GRAS under their intended conditions of use. Some of the intended uses for these ingredients include adding them as source of protein, carbohydrates, oil, and other nutrients to beverages (juices, smoothies, protein drinks, plant-based alternatives to dairy products), soups, dips, spreads, sauces, dressings, plant-based alternatives to meat products, desserts, baked goods, cereals, snacks and nutrition bars. Our CBD products are made from seeds and mature stalks of hemp and contain only trace amounts of THC, we believe they qualify as GRAS products.

We have not obtained and do not plan to obtain FDA approval of our CBD products. As a result, we could be subject to enforcement proceedings by the FDA. We do not believe that FDA enforcement proceedings are likely since our products only contain trace elements of THC and do not cause the "high" associated with the THC in marijuana. Additionally, Hemp Finished Products like those sold by us are sold by large retailers online including Whole Foods, Publix, Wal-Mart and others. Despite the foregoing, should we become subject to FDA or other enforcement proceedings we could have to cease operations. 
 
Other Regulations Impacting our Hemp Finished - CBD Products
 
Some states are considering various taxation of marijuana-related products including hemp finished products. These considerations seem to range from routine sales taxes to taxes similar to those imposed on tobacco products. Though, for the reasons described above, we do not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be subject to any marijuana-related taxation schemes, it is unclear whether Hemp Finished Products would fall under these tax plans if and when they are imposed.
 
IRS section 280(E) prevents cannabis companies from deducting expenses from their income, except for those considered cost of goods sold. No deduction or credit is allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by federal law or the law of any State in which such trade or business is conducted. Though, for the reasons described above, we do not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be appropriately treated as a controlled substance, IRC 280(E) is enforced against us relating to deductions concerning our Hemp Finished Products, such tax treatment could create operating and cash flow problems in the future.
 
Regulation of our Products not Containing CBD
 
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our non-hemp based products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and, to a lesser extent, the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC are concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product's ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food, including dietary supplements, and over-the-counter drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division ("NAD") of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry sponsored, self-regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own, but may refer matters that appear to violate the Federal Trade Commission Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action, as appropriate.
 
Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease and desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress (for example, requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers), seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties, or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food, dietary supplement and over-the-counter drug industries, including the imposition of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants.
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ("DSHEA") was enacted in 1994, amending the FDCA. We believe DSHEA is generally favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of "dietary supplements”, which includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a "new dietary ingredient" ("NDI") premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may require the submission, at least seventy-five (75) days before marketing of an NDI notification containing information establishing that the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for its intended use. Among other things, DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as "food additives" and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels and in labeling. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA and has issued draft guidance on NDI notification requirements. Further guidance and regulations are expected. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that would make this law less favorable to consumers and industry have been proposed in Congress.

The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 ("NLEA”) amended the FDCA to establish additional requirements for ingredient and nutrition labeling and labeling claims for foods. If the NLEA labeling requirements change at a future time, we may need to revise our product labeling. Our non-CBD products are classified as dietary supplements. The FDA has concluded that THC and CBD products are excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement. The FDA issued a Final Rule on GMPs for dietary supplements on June 22, 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products, including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things, the new GMPs: (a) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients, call for a "scientifically valid system" for ensuring finished products meet all specifications, (b) include requirements related to process controls, including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures, and (c) require extensive recordkeeping.
 
We have reviewed the GMPs and have taken steps to ensure compliance. While we believe we are in compliance, there can be no assurance that our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally, there is a potential risk of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMP’s.
 
On December 22, 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which went into effect on December 22, 2007. The law requires, among other things, that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers, the press and government regulators could misinterpret reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of, which could lead to additional regulations, banned ingredients or products, increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation, among other things.
 
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 ("CPSIA") primarily addresses children's product safety but also improves the administrative process of the CPSC. Among other things, the CPSIA requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances the CPSC's authority to order recalls.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA's authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines if there is reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include the FDA's expanded access to records; the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.
 
One of the FSMA’s more significant changes is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls ("HARBPC") for all food facilities required to register with the FDA, except dietary supplement facilities in compliance with both GMPs and the serious adverse event reporting requirements. Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from the HARBPC requirements, dietary ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. The HARBPC requirements, which the FDA has yet to propose, are expected to be onerous because facilities will have to develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly minimized or prevented, monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls and maintain numerous records related to the HARBPC. The HARBPC requirements may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and/or affect our ability to obtain dietary ingredients.
 
As required by Section 113(b) of the FSMA, the FDA published in July 2011, a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a dietary ingredient is an NDI, when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA, the evidence necessary to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance, if implemented as proposed, could have a material impact on our operations. Although our industry has strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance, it is unclear whether the FDA will make changes to the final guidance. In addition, it is possible that the FDA will begin taking enforcement actions consistent with the interpretations in the draft guidance before issuing a final version. The new FSMA requirements, as well as the FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written, could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance and the potential imposition of fees for re-inspection of noncompliant facilities. Each of these events would increase our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The FTC and the FDA have pursued a coordinated effort to challenge what they consider to be unsubstantiated and unsafe weight-loss products, and have also coordinated enforcement against dietary supplement claims in other areas, including children's products. Their efforts to date have focused on manufacturers and marketers as well as media outlets, and have resulted in a significant number of investigations and enforcement actions, some resulting in civil penalties of several million dollars under the Federal Trade Commission Act. We expect that the FTC and the FDA will continue to focus on health-related claims for dietary supplements and foods which could cause our non-CBD products to be the subject of an FTC/FDA inquiry.
