Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a late-stage clinical company advancing targeted fusion protein therapeutics ("TFPTs") for the treatment of patients with cancer. We genetically fuse the targeting antibody fragment and the cytotoxic protein payload into a single molecule which is produced through our proprietary one-step, microbial manufacturing process. We target tumor cell surface antigens with limited expression on normal cells. Binding of the target antigen by the TFPT allows for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell. We have designed our targeted proteins to overcome the fundamental efficacy and safety challenges inherent in existing antibody-drug conjugates ("ADCs") where a payload is chemically attached to a targeting antibody. 
Our most advanced product candidate, Vicineum, also known as VB4-845, is a locally-administered targeted fusion protein composed of an anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule ("EpCAM") antibody fragment tethered to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. 
In December 2020, we submitted our completed BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to the FDA, which was accepted for filing by the FDA in February 2021. The FDA granted Priority Review for the BLA and set a target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA of August 18, 2021. On August 13, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form and provided recommendations specific to additional clinical/statistical data and analyses in addition to CMC issues pertaining to a recent pre-approval inspection and product quality. On August 20, 2021, we withdrew our MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in order to pause our plans to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum in the European Union until there is more clarity from the FDA on next steps for Vicineum in the United States. Vysyneum is the proprietary brand name that was conditionally approved by the EMA for oportuzumab monatox in the European Union. In October 2021, the EMA issued its Withdrawal Assessment Report relating to our MAA for Vysyneum, as is consistent with the EMA’s standard practice when an MAA is withdrawn. The EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report reflects the initial assessment and corresponding questions from the EMA and identifies major objections in the areas of quality, good clinical practice, efficacy and safety. Due to the high concordance between FDA and European Commission approvals, we believe that the probability of success of future approval in the European Union for Vysyneum increases if FDA approval for Vicineum has already been obtained. 
On October 29, 2021, we participated in a Type A Meeting with the FDA to discuss questions related to CMC raised in the CRL (the “CMC Type A Meeting”). During the CMC Type A Meeting, we and the FDA reviewed issues related to CMC to be further discussed during the review of a BLA for Vicineum upon potential resubmission. We believe we have a clear understanding of what additional information regarding CMC is required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. Additionally, although not an issue raised in the CRL, the FDA confirmed at the CMC Type A Meeting that Vicineum manufactured using the proposed commercial process is comparable to Vicineum used in prior clinical trials. The FDA also confirmed that we can utilize Vicineum manufactured during process validation for any future clinical trials needed to address issues raised in the CRL, and that these potential trials can proceed while addressing CMC issues.
On December 8, 2021, we participated in a Type A Meeting with the FDA to discuss design elements of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum (the “Clinical Type A Meeting”), which the FDA confirmed will be required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. The trial design may include these elements:
•A randomized clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of Vicineum compared to investigators’ choice of intravesical chemotherapy;
•Trial may include both patients who have received adequate BCG1 and patients who have received less than adequate BCG;
•The FDA encouraged us to submit the final results from the Phase 3 VISTA trial for Vicineum with a BLA resubmission.
1As per the 2018 FDA guidance on NMIBC, adequate BCG is defined as at least one of the following: (i) at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of three doses of maintenance therapy or (ii) at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of six doses of a second induction course.
On January 7, 2022, the FDA granted our request for a Type C Meeting to discuss the study protocol for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we plan to conduct for potential resubmission of a BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. The Type C Meeting has been scheduled for March 28, 2022.
One of the items we expect to be discussed in the Type C Meeting is the patient population for the additional Phase 3 clinical trial, which may be different than the patient population studied in previous clinical trials for Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC in two primary ways. 
First, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial may include patients with only non-muscle invasive carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder, and may not include patients with only papillary disease of the bladder. This change would lead to a smaller overall patient population than previously studied, as some of our past clinical trials of Vicineum in NMIBC have included patients with CIS or high-grade papillary disease of the bladder. 
Second, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial may include patients who have received less than adequate BCG in addition to those who have received adequate BCG, per the FDA’s guidance. Receipt of less than adequate BCG could be due to (i) failure of, or intolerance to, a BCG therapy prior to reaching the FDA’s definition of adequate BCG or (ii) supply shortages of BCG, among other reasons. This change would lead to a larger patient population than previously studied, as past clinical trials of Vicineum in NMIBC only included patients who had previously been treated with adequate BCG.
Potential changes related to the additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum will be discussed at the upcoming Type C Meeting with the FDA scheduled for March 28, 2022.
Our TFPT Platform
Our current product candidates are based on our proprietary TFPT platform and are focused on addressing areas of unmet medical need in cancer. Our novel TFPTs have been designed to overcome the efficacy and safety challenges of existing ADCs and are being developed for both local and systemic-administration. Our TFPTs are single protein therapeutics composed of targeting domains genetically fused via peptide linkers to cytotoxic protein payloads that are produced through our proprietary recombinant one-step, microbial manufacturing process. Our TFPT platform uses protein binding antibody fragments, which include Fabs, single chain variable domains ("ScFvs"), and non-covalent scFv dimers ("diabodies"), derived from the domains of antibodies that confer antigen recognition. We select antibody fragments for our product candidates depending upon the target therapeutic indication. We target tumor cell surface antigens that allow for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell and that also have limited expression in normal cells. For local administrations, we utilize an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload designed to both target cancer cells and promote a heightened local immune response against the tumor. For systemic-administrations, we use deBouganin, a plant-derived, protein payload of reduced immunogenic potential that we believe can be repeatedly administered via infusion without the generation of an efficacy-limiting immune response against the payload.
Locally-administered TFPTs
We utilize our TFPTs with immunogenic cytotoxic protein payloads for tumors that can be targeted locally rather than systemically. Local administration allows for the TFPT to reach the tumor without being cleared by the immune system, which enables us to maximize the concentration of TFPTs directly to tumors. Our locally-administered TFPT Vicineum, which is our lead product candidate in development for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, contains a targeting antibody binding domain that is designed to bind to EpCAM, a protein over-expressed in many cancers. This binding domain is genetically fused to a truncated form of exotoxin A ("ETA"), which is an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is produced by the bacterial species Pseudomonas. This product candidate is designed to bind to EpCAM on the surface of cancer cells. The TFPT-EpCAM complex is subsequently internalized into the cell and, once inside the cell, the TFPT is cleaved by a cellular enzyme to release the cytotoxic protein payload, thus enabling cancer cell killing.
We also believe that our TFPTs designed for local administration may not only directly kill cancer cells through targeted delivery of a cytotoxic protein payload, but also potentiate an anti-cancer therapeutic immune response. This immune response is believed to be triggered by the immunogenic cell death of the cancer cells due to our payload's mechanism of action and the subsequent release of tumor antigens and the immunologically active setting created by the nature of the cytotoxic protein payloads. We believe that this immune response may also enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors, that require a pre-existing immune response for maximum efficacy.
Our most advanced locally-administered TFPT product candidate is Vicineum, in development for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ("SCCHN"). This TFPT is not, however, suitable for systemic-administration over multiple doses because the body’s immune system would recognize and eliminate foreign proteins, such as ETA, prior to their reaching targeted cancer cells.
Systemically-administered TFPTs
We also utilize our TFPTs with a de-immunized payload where systemic-administration is required. Our systemically-administered TFPTs are built around deBouganin. Since the body’s immune system naturally recognizes and attempts to 
eliminate foreign proteins, we designed our systemically-administered TFPTs with a deBouganin payload to avoid inducing an immunogenic response. DeBouganin is constructed by mutating the immunogenic T-cell epitopes from bouganin so that they are not recognized as foreign by the immune system. However, we also believe that deBouganin may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors as a result of the promotion of a local tumor immune response following the death of cancer cells. Our systemically-administered product candidate is VB6-845d for the treatment of multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors. 
Our Differentiated Approach to Targeted Therapies
We believe that our TFPT platform will address many challenges experienced with existing ADCs. The basic construct for our TFPTs and existing ADCs is similar as each is comprised of a targeting domain that specifically binds to cancer cells and delivers a cytotoxic payload. However, existing ADCs have been associated with limitations that we believe are addressed by our TFPTs.
Limitations of Existing ADC Approaches to Treating Tumors 
    We believe existing ADCs have the following fundamental efficacy and safety challenges:
•Deliver insufficient drug to tumors. Existing ADCs utilize full-length antibodies, which, due to their large size, have a reduced ability to penetrate tumors, thereby potentially reducing their efficacy.
•Inability to kill a broad array of cancer cells within a tumor. Subsets of cancer cells within tumors may have mechanisms to resist and not be responsive to the cytotoxic payloads, or small molecule chemotherapies, used in existing ADCs.
•Off-target toxicities due to unstable chemical linkage between targeting antibody and cytotoxic payload. Existing ADCs utilize chemical linkage strategies to join antibodies to small molecule cytotoxic payloads. While in the circulatory system, these chemical linkages can break and release free cytotoxic payloads in the circulation. These free small molecule cytotoxic payloads are not targeted and cannot discriminate between dividing cancer cells and non-cancerous cells, thus resulting in increased off-target toxicities.
•Limited combination therapy potential. Adverse events may limit the potential utility of existing ADCs in combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors which have their own adverse events, including immune-related adverse events.
•Complex and challenging manufacturing process. The multi-step manufacturing process of existing ADCs creates a non-homogeneous product that limits efficacy and drives greater costs than those estimated for our manufacturing process.
Advantages of our TFPT Platform
    We believe our TFPTs offer the following key advantages:
•Deliver a greater amount of drug to tumors. Our TFPTs are designed using smaller targeting proteins that have an increased ability to exit the circulatory system and have binding properties designed to enable deeper penetration into targeted tumors, and we believe this will increase efficacy.
•Ability to kill a broader array of cancer cells within a tumor. Our novel cytotoxic payloads consist of proteins rather than small molecule cytotoxic payloads. We believe the larger size of our cytotoxic protein payloads helps circumvent multi-drug resistance mechanisms that can make certain cancer cells resistant to small molecule cytotoxic payloads. By contrast to existing ADCs, which employ cytotoxic payloads that inhibit cellular replication and are effective at killing rapidly proliferating cancer cells, our cytotoxic protein payloads inhibit protein synthesis and are designed to kill not only rapidly proliferating, but also slowly growing cancer cells including tumor progenitor cells/cancer stem-like cells.
•Increase safety due to a more stable linkage between targeting protein and cytotoxic payload. Our single protein molecules are designed to remain intact until they reach the inside of the cancer cell and to not release free cytotoxins into the circulatory system, thereby minimizing off-target toxicity.
•Promote a therapeutic immune response. We believe that the potent TFPT toxin-mediated killing of cancer cells in this immunologically active setting leads to the efficient presentation of cancer antigens to the immune system, thereby promoting an anti-tumor cellular immune response. Our locally-administered TFPTs utilize an immunogenic cytotoxic payload that we believe promotes a heightened immune response in the local tumor environment.
•Potential combination with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that the potential effect of checkpoint inhibitors, which are antibodies that promote the action of anti-tumor T-cells by blocking inhibitory ligand/receptor interactions that include PD-1 and PD-L1, may be enhanced when used in combination with other agents. We believe that, by mediating specific killing of tumor cells and promoting anti-tumor immune responses, our TFPTs, while potentially effective on their own, may complement checkpoint inhibitors. In particular, we believe that the 
use of our cytotoxin payload ETA, which induces immunogenic cell death, may facilitate the presentation of tumor cell surface antigens following the death of cancer cells, thereby providing a tumor immune response to enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
•Utilize a simpler and more efficient manufacturing process. Our proprietary recombinant one-step manufacturing process creates a homogeneous product that we believe will improve efficacy and result in lower manufacturing costs.
Our Strategy
We are committed to designing, engineering, developing and commercializing TFPTs to identify and address oncology indications that suffer from a high unmet medical need. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
•Obtain regulatory approval of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. In December 2020, we submitted our completed BLA for Vicineum to the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, which was accepted for filing by the FDA in February 2021. The FDA granted Priority Review for the BLA and set a target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA of August 18, 2021. On August 13, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form. On August 20, 2021, we withdrew our MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in order to pause our plans to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum in the European Union until there is more clarity from the FDA on next steps for Vicineum in the United States. In October and December 2021, we participated in a CMC Type A Meeting and a Clinical Type A Meeting, respectively, with the FDA to discuss issues raised in the CRL and design elements of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum, which the FDA confirmed will be required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. Following these Type A Meetings, we believe we have greater clarity of the requirements for potential resubmission of a BLA. We have a Type C Meeting scheduled with the FDA for March 28, 2022 in which we expect to discuss the study protocol for the additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we plan to conduct for potential resubmission of a BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.
•Maximize the commercial potential Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. We own exclusive, worldwide rights to Vicineum and we have out-licensed the rights to Vicineum in Greater China, the Middle East and North Africa region (“MENA”) and Turkey. If Vicineum receives marketing approval from the FDA for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, we plan to pursue commercialization strategies that maximize the value of Vicineum in the United States by partnering with a contract sales organization. Based on our market research, we believe Vicineum has an innovative profile with a high possibility that patients, healthcare professionals and payors will be advocates for its use for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, which we believe represents a significant commercial opportunity. We believe that we will be able to effectively communicate differentiating characteristics and key attributes of Vicineum to patients, physicians and payors, with the goal of establishing favorable reimbursement as well as a favorable formulary status in targeted urology practices. Additionally, we believe that our plans to partner with a contract sales organization should allow us to address the urologists-initiated treatment market for non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG in the United States in an efficient and effective way. 
•Expand on the value of Vicineum through strategic partnerships. If we obtain regulatory approval for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, we intend to build a North American specialty urology sales force to market the product in the United States. Outside the United States, we will continue to seek additional business development partners with urology expertise by selectively partnering with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies when we believe that a partner could bring additional resources and expertise to maximize the value of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. In 2020 and 2021, we entered into license agreements to support such commercialization efforts outside the United States for Greater China, MENA and Turkey.
•Explore opportunities in combination therapies. We plan to continue discussions with potential partners that utilize technologies whose mechanism of action could be complementary to our TFPT platform. These technologies include, but are not limited to, checkpoint inhibitors, immune modulators and other immuno-oncology agents. In June 2017, we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA") with the National Cancer Institute ("NCI") for the development of Vicineum in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab for the treatment of NMIBC. Vicineum is believed to work via a dual 
mechanism of action to directly kill cancer cells and activate a local inflammatory process that stimulates T-cells, which then proliferate and destroy the cancer cells. Because of this second mechanism, there may be potential for a synergistic effect when given in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Under the terms of the CRADA, this hypothesis is being tested by the NCI in Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological correlates of Vicineum in combination with durvalumab (“NCI Trial”). On September 10, 2021, preliminary results from an interim analysis of 12 patients in the NCI Trial (“Interim Analysis”) were presented at a conference hosted by the American Urological Association. Enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing. Based on the Interim Analysis, the combination of Vicineum and durvalumab has been generally well-tolerated with no new safety signals emerging (no Grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events) and has a similar safety profile compared to both agents used individually. The Interim Analysis also indicated a 3-month complete response rate of 42% (5/12) and a 12-month complete response rate of 17% (2/12). 
We have deferred further development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN and of VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development and, if approved, the commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. We are also exploring collaborations for Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN and for VB6-845d.
Our Product Pipeline
At this time, we are focused exclusively on the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and have deferred further development of our other product candidates. The following table sets forth our current development stage programs:
Vicineum for the Treatment of Non-Muscle Invasive CIS of the Bladder in Patients Previously Treated with Adequate or Less Than Adequate BCG
Overview
We are developing Vicineum, oportuzumab monatox, for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. Vicineum is given via intravesical administration directly into the bladder. Vicineum utilizes an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is a truncated form of ETA produced by the bacterial species Pseudomonas. Vicineum also includes an anti-EpCAM ScFv targeting domain that is required to deliver the ETA into EpCAM-expressing cancer cells. The toxicity to non-cancerous bladder cells is minimized due to their not having EpCAM over-expressed on their surface. In August 2018, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The FDA has conditionally accepted the proprietary brand name VICINEUM™ for our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox.
Disease Overview
Most cancers that form in the bladder are transitional cell carcinomas that derive from the transitional cell lining of the bladder. Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder can be characterized as either high-grade or low-grade. Low-grade bladder cancer often occurs in the lining of the bladder, but rarely invades the muscular wall of the bladder or spreads to other parts of the body and is unlikely to be fatal. High-grade bladder cancer commonly occurs in the bladder, has a strong tendency to invade the muscular wall of the bladder, spread to other parts of the body and is more likely to result in death. Bladder cancer is also divided into muscle-invasive and non-muscle invasive, based on invasion of the muscularis propria, which is the thick muscle deep in the bladder wall. Muscle-invasive disease is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.
There are three forms of high-grade NMIBC: Ta, a papillary tumor in the innermost layer of the bladder lining; T1, a papillary tumor that has started to grow into the connective tissue beneath the bladder lining; and CIS, flat lesions of the transitional cell lining of the bladder. Papillary tumors are generally low-grade with low risk of progression, although about two to nine percent are high-grade, with a moderately high risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Evaluable CIS tumors are always high-grade, with a worse prognosis than papillary tumors, as such CIS tumors are more aggressive, with a higher probability of progression to muscle-invasive disease. Furthermore, the incidence of CIS in conjunction with Ta or T1 tumors results in a higher risk of recurrence and progression. About 75% to 85% of bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive. Of these, Ta tumors account for about 70%, T1 tumors account for about 20% and CIS lesions account for about 10%.
According to World Cancer Research Fund International figures, bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and the second most common malignancy of the genitourinary system, which refers to cancers of the urinary system of men and women and the reproductive organs of men. In 2020, there were an estimated 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed and 213,000 deaths worldwide, according to data from the Global Cancer Observatory. The 5-year global prevalence of bladder cancer, or the number of individuals with bladder cancer in a 5-year period, is estimated at 1.7 million individuals. The most recent data from the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Result Program ("SEER") estimated that approximately 84,000 new cases of bladder cancer would be diagnosed in 2021 and there would be approximately 17,000 deaths due to bladder cancer in the United States during 2021. Based on a 2014 publication in Current Opinion in Urology, among cancers in the United States, bladder cancer has the highest per-patient treatment costs, with an estimated overall cost of approximately $4.0 billion annually and has the highest overall cost among the elderly. Based on our assessment of the market, the treatment paradigm has remained the same since those figures were generated, and we believe the cost of care has increased.
NMIBC makes up 75% to 85% of all bladder cancers. The high recurrence rate and ongoing invasive monitoring requirement of bladder cancers are the key contributors to the economic and human toll of this disease. Bladder cancer occurs predominantly in older patients (about nine of the ten people with bladder cancer are over the age of 55 years). The median age at diagnosis is approximately 73 years of age. Overall, the five-year survival rate for bladder cancer in the United States is 77%. While the five-year survival rates are 98% for stage zero and 88% for stage one NMIBC, once the cancer becomes invasive, the rates drop dramatically with five-year survival rates of 63%, 46% and 15% for stage two, three and four muscle invasive bladder cancers, respectively. We are targeting patients with non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. Our initial target market includes the approximately 6,000 patients in the US diagnosed annually, including those patients with non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. We would expect that, if Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG is approved by the FDA, patients would receive treatment until the earlier of 2 years and disease recurrence.
Current Approaches to Treatment
Within non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, the initial treatment of Ta or T1 is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor ("TURBT") followed by BCG treatment. For CIS, whether or not TURBT is an option, BCG is the standard of care. BCG is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, with 
a diminished virulence in humans. Since BCG works by utilizing an immune/inflammatory mechanism, BCG is generally initiated two to four weeks after TURBT, allowing the urothelium to heal and lowering the risk of systemic infection. When high-grade bladder tumors have been completely resected, BCG is used as adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence. In patients with residual disease after resection, BCG helps to eradicate residual disease and delay progression. The BCG regimen consists of an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase. The induction phase involves six consecutive once-weekly instillations of the drug into the bladder. The maintenance phase involves three consecutive once-weekly instillations repeated every three to six months for at least one year. The response rate to a single induction phase of BCG is 60% to 70% with an additional 30% to 50% of the non-responders becoming responders following a second induction phase. However, BCG’s failure rate for all responders is estimated to be as high as 50% within the first 12 months of treatment and 90% within five years. 
For patients who received BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, surgical removal of the bladder, or a radical cystectomy has been recommended due to the risk of progression to muscle invasive disease, which greatly reduces a patient’s prognosis. Radical cystectomy is a complex surgery associated with a mortality rate of 8% within six months of surgery. The surgery also entails a number of short-term risks including bleeding and/or clots, infections, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, peritonitis and injury to the urethra. More than 25% of radical cystectomy patients require hospital readmission for surgery-related complications within 90 days following surgery. The impact of radical cystectomy is life-altering, with major lifestyle changes, including incontinence and sexual dysfunction, and daily issues related to management of the external bag for urine collection.
Keytruda was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy and is the only approval of Keytruda in the NMIBC space. Keytruda has been on the market for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive CIS (+/- Ta/T1) patients since January 2020. In 2009, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Valstar (valrubicin) was re-launched in the United States for the treatment of BCG-refractory CIS bladder cancer in patients for whom radical cystectomy is not an option. Valstar is administered directly into the bladder once a week for six weeks. Due to drug resistance and toxicities, Valstar has had limited clinical utility. Other than Keytruda and Valstar, there are no other approved therapies for BCG-unresponsive CIS bladder cancer. However, there are various other intravesical product candidates in development for the treatment of NMIBC, including product candidates developed by FerGene Inc. (Adstiladrin/nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3)), AADi, LLC (ABI-009), ImmunityBio (Anktiva/N-803 in combination with BCG), Theralase Technologies Inc. (TLD-1433), Janssen (Erdafitinib and TAR-200) and CG Oncology (CG0070). In addition, systemically-administered checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated for the treatment of NMIBC including products developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Opdivo alone or in combination with BCG +/- BMS986205), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Tecentriq) and AstraZeneca (Imfinzi). Another route of administration for checkpoint inhibitor is currently being evaluated by Pfizer with the subcutaneous administration of Sasanlimab (PF-06801591) for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients. 
Regulatory Update
United States
In December 2020, we submitted our completed BLA for Vicineum for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to the FDA, which was accepted for filing by the FDA in February 2021. The FDA granted Priority Review for the BLA and set a target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA of August 18, 2021. On August 13, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form and provided recommendations specific to additional clinical/statistical data and analyses in addition to CMC issues pertaining to a recent pre-approval inspection and product quality. 
On October 29, 2021, we participated in a CMC Type A Meeting with the FDA. During the CMC Type A Meeting, we and the FDA reviewed issues related to CMC to be further discussed during the review of a BLA for Vicineum upon potential resubmission. We believe we have a clear understanding of what additional information regarding CMC is required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. Additionally, although not an issue raised in the CRL, the FDA confirmed at the CMC Type A Meeting that Vicineum manufactured using the proposed commercial process is comparable to Vicineum used in prior clinical trials. The FDA also confirmed that we can utilize Vicineum manufactured during process validation for any future clinical trials needed to address issues raised in the CRL, and that any of these future trials can proceed while addressing CMC issues raised in the CRL. 
On December 8, 2021, we participated in a Clinical Type A Meeting with the FDA to discuss design elements of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum, which the FDA confirmed will be required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. The FDA encouraged us to include the Vista Trial data in a BLA resubmission.
On January 7, 2022, the FDA granted our request for a Type C Meeting to discuss the study protocol for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we plan to conduct for potential resubmission of a BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive 
CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. The Type C Meeting has been scheduled for March 28, 2022.
Although the FDA previously conditionally accepted the name Vicineum for our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox, in the United States, this approval is subject to further and final review by FDA upon potential resubmission of a BLA. If the FDA objects to our proposed proprietary product name, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.
European Union
On March 5, 2021, we submitted a MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC under the EMA’s centralized procedure. On March 31, 2021, we were informed that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA had conditionally accepted the proprietary brand name Vysyneum for our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox, in the European Union. 
On August 20, 2021, we withdrew our MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in order to pause our plans to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum in the European Union until there is more clarity from the FDA on next steps for Vicineum in the United States. 
On October 20, 2021, the EMA issued its Withdrawal Assessment Report relating to our MAA for Vysyneum, as is consistent with the EMA’s standard practice when an MAA is withdrawn. The Assessment Report reflects the initial assessment and corresponding questions from the EMA and identifies major objections in the areas of quality, good clinical practice, efficacy and safety. Due to the high concordance between FDA and European Commission approvals, we believe that the probability of success of future approval in the European Union for Vysyneum increases if FDA approval for Vicineum has already been obtained.
Although the EMA previously conditionally accepted the name Vysyneum for our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox, in the European Union, this approval is subject to further and final review by the EMA upon potential resubmission of the MAA. If the EMA objects to our proposed proprietary product name, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the EMA.
China
On July 30, 2020, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Qilu Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd. (“Qilu”) pursuant to which we granted Qilu an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by us, to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and other types of cancer in Greater China. The Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for Vicineum submitted by Qilu to the Center for Drug Evaluation of the China National Medical Products Administration was accepted for review in January 2021 and approved in March 2021. 
On June 1, 2021, we entered into a Global Supply Agreement with Qilu pursuant to which Qilu will be part of the manufacturing network for, if approved, global commercial supply of Vicineum drug substance and drug product.
On July 20, 2021 we and Qilu announced the enrollment of the first patient in China in a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Vicineum in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The open-label, single-arm, multi-center bridging trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vicineum in approximately 53 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary disease, high-grade Ta papillary disease or T1 papillary disease of any grade. Patients will be required to have failed previous treatment with BCG for inclusion in the trial. The primary endpoints are the complete response rate (for CIS patients) and the recurrence-free rate (for papillary patients) at six months, with the complete response rate and the recurrence-free rate at three months, safety and tolerability as the secondary endpoints. Based on the partnership agreement between Sesen Bio and Qilu Pharmaceutical, the trial is being run at the sole cost of Qilu Pharmaceutical.
MENA
On November 30, 2020, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC, to develop and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the MENA region (20 countries in the Middle East and North Africa). No submission for registration has taken place in any of the countries as approvals are contingent on FDA or EMA approval.
Turkey
On August 5, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with EİP Eczacıbaşı İlaç Pazarlama A.Ş., to develop and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. No submission for registration has taken place in either region as approvals are contingent on FDA or EMA approval.
Internal Review
In September 2021 we disclosed that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) initiated an independent internal review conducted by outside counsel with the assistance of subject matter experts focusing on the conduct of, and data generated from, the clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and the overall safety of Vicineum (the “Review”). The Review took place over the course of five months, involved full cooperation from our management team, a review of more than 600,000 documents, and 39 interviews of current and former employees and consultants. It is now complete. As a result of the Review, the Board continues to fully support our current management team and believes no changes or amendments relating to our prior disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the FDA relating to Vicineum, the Phase 3 VISTA trial for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, or the BLA for Vicineum are warranted. We intend to work cooperatively with the FDA in preparing for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum. 
New Proposed Phase 3 Clinical Trial
On January 7, 2022, the FDA granted our request for a Type C Meeting to discuss the study protocol for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we plan to conduct for potential resubmission of a BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. The Type C Meeting has been scheduled for March 28, 2022.
Prior Phase 3 Clinical Trial – VISTA Trial
We, through our subsidiary Viventia, commenced our single-arm, multi-center, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial ("VISTA Trial') in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC who have received adequate BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, and for whom the then-current standard of care was a radical cystectomy in the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Canada. Based on safety and efficacy data observed with the longer 12-week induction in our Phase 2 clinical trial, the FDA agreed to our plan to employ more frequent dosing in the VISTA Trial, in which the primary endpoints were complete response ("CR") and duration of response ("DoR") in patients with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive. In November 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new drugs and biologics for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including the use of single-arm trials. The FDA finalized this guidance in February 2018 and retained many of the recommendations from the 2016 draft guidance regarding clinical trial design, including the use of single-arm trials. We believe that our VISTA Trial design was consistent with these aspects of the FDA’s guidance. 
The primary and secondary endpoints for the VISTA Trial were as follows:

Dose | 30 mg of Vicineum (in 50 mL of saline) 
Total enrollment | 133 patients, including 93 CIS patients whose disease is BCG-unresponsive 
Primary endpoints | CRR at 3 months in patients with CIS (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is BCG-unresponsive; and
Kaplan-Meier estimate of DoR for BCG-unresponsive CIS patients who experience a CR at 3 months (post-induction).

Patients with CIS were considered to have a CR if at the time of any disease status evaluation (per protocol every 13 weeks or any unscheduled evaluation) there was no evidence of high-grade disease (CIS, high-grade Ta or any grade T1 disease) or disease progression (e.g., to muscle invasive disease). Low-grade disease was not considered a treatment failure in these patients, and they could remain on study treatment following TURBT.

Secondary endpoints | Event-free survival in all patients; 
CRR at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months in patients with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive;
Time to cystectomy in all patients; 
Time to disease recurrence in papillary patients; 
PFS in all patients; 
OS in all patients; and 
Safety and tolerability of Vicineum therapy in all patients. 
Exploratory endpoint | To evaluate biomarkers that may be associated with response or disease progression or treatment failure, which may include, for example, EpCAM status, tumor subtype morphology, furin levels in tumor cell endosomes, presence of a glycosaminoglycan coat and presence of receptors that could impede a host anti-tumor immune response, such as PD-L1.

The VISTA Trial completed enrollment in April 2018 with a total of 133 patients across three cohorts based on histology and time to disease recurrence after adequate BCG treatment (under 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of NMIBC, adequate BCG is defined as at least one of the following (i) at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of three doses of maintenance therapy or (ii) at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of six doses of a second induction course):
•Cohort 1 (n=86): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that was determined to be refractory or recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG;
•Cohort 2 (n=7): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that recurred after six months, but less than 11 months, after their last course of adequate BCG; and 
•Cohort 3 (n=40): Patients with high-risk (Ta or T1) papillary disease without CIS that recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG.
The primary endpoints of the VISTA Trial were CRR at 3 months in patients with CIS (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is BCG-unresponsive and DoR for BCG-unresponsive CIS patients who experience a CR.
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, preliminary primary and secondary endpoint data for each of the trial cohorts were as follows:
Cohort 1 (n=86) Evaluable Population (n=82) Complete Response Rate, for CIS:
Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)

9-months | n=38 | 45% (29%-62%) 
12-months | n=38 | 42% (26%-59%) 

†Recurrence-free rate is defined as the percentage of patients that are recurrence-free at the given assessment time point.
*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
    Duration of Response: The median DoR for patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined (n=93) is 287 days (95% CI, 154-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis of pooled data for all patients with CIS (Cohorts 1 and 2, n=93) shows that among patients who achieved a complete response at 3 months, 52% remained disease-free for a total of 12 months or longer after starting treatment, using the Kaplan-Meier method. DoR is defined as the time from first occurrence of complete response to documentation of treatment failure or death.
    We have conducted additional analyses for secondary endpoints. These additional data include the following:
•Time to Cystectomy: Across all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial, greater than 75% of all patients are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis shows that approximately 88% of responders are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years. Time to cystectomy is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to surgical bladder removal. The first 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients states that the goal of therapy in such patients is to avoid cystectomy. Therefore, time to cystectomy is a key secondary endpoint in the VISTA Trial. 
•Time to Disease Recurrence: High-grade papillary (Ta or T1) NMIBC is associated with high rates of progression and recurrence. The median time to disease recurrence for patients in Cohort 3 (n=40) is 402 days (95% CI, 170-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Time to disease recurrence is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of treatment failure or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation. 
•Progression-Free Survival ("PFS"): 90% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain progression-free for 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression (e.g., T2 or more advanced disease) or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation.
•Event-Free Survival: 29% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain event-free at 12 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Event-free survival is defined as the time from the date 
of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease recurrence, progression or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation.
•Overall Survival ("OS"): 96% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to have an overall survival of 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death from any cause.
Data is as of the May 29, 2019 data cut from the Phase III VISTA trial. The clinical data shown are based on the data submitted in the BLA on December 18, 2020. Final numbers are pending. On August 13, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL for the BLA that included requests for additional clinical and statistical data. 
Safety Results
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%), all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5 or death). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial.
Phase 1 and 2 Clinical Trials
Phase 1 Clinical Trial. We initiated an open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in September 2004 at 22 sites in Canada. We enrolled 64 patients with high-grade Ta or T1 tumors with or without CIS (17 of which had CIS) and who had previously received at least one treatment of BCG. The Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase 2 dose. The secondary objective was to explore the anti-tumor activity of Vicineum. 
Eight dose levels were initially evaluated, ranging from 0.1 to 10.56 mg, and given once weekly for six consecutive weeks. Each dose was administered by instillation and held for two hours prior to voiding. Safety data from each dose cohort was evaluated after three weeks of treatment before proceeding to the next dose cohort. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached; therefore, additional escalations through 13.73 mg, 17.85 mg, 23.20 mg and 30.16 mg were undertaken. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and no maximum tolerated dose was reached in these additional dose-escalations. Vicineum was generally well-tolerated at each of these escalated doses. 
A CR was defined in this Phase 1 clinical trial as non-positive urine cytology and either normal cystoscopy or abnormal cystoscopy with negative biopsy. Of the 64 patients enrolled, only 61 were considered to be evaluable for efficacy as two patients were excluded from the analysis due to an absence of BCG treatment prior to this Phase 1 clinical trial, and there was one unrelated death for whom no final tumor assessment was obtained. Evidence of clinical efficacy, as defined by a CR, was achieved by 24 of the 61 randomized patients (39%). Only three of the 17 patients (18%) treated in the 0.1-<1 mg/dose range were CRs. In contrast, seven of the 14 patients (50%) treated in 1.0-<10 mg/dose range and 14 of the 30 patients (46.7%) treated in the ≥10 mg/dose range experienced CRs at the three-month assessment. Of the patients with CIS, five of the 17 patients (29%) achieved a CR, while non-recurrence was observed in seven of the 16 patients with T1 (43.8%) and 12 of the 28 patients with Ta (42.8%). This Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in April 2006.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial. Based on our Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Canada, we submitted the IND for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to the FDA in August 2005, and we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Vicineum in March 2007 at 20 sites in Canada and the United States. We enrolled 46 patients with CIS (with or without Ta or T1) who had previously received at least one treatment of BCG. Of the 46 patients enrolled, 27 patients (58.7%) had received at least two treatments of BCG. The Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to determine the tolerability and explore the potential for clinical benefit from Vicineum. Clinical benefit was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as a CR or no evidence of disease at the three-month evaluation. A CR was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as no histological evidence of disease and negative urine cytology. Any cases with no histological evidence of disease on initial biopsy but atypical or suspicious urine cytology were also considered CRs only if they remained negative after being evaluated with repeat biopsy, directed and random. A patient was considered to have a durable CR if that patient obtained a CR and remained disease-free for a period of at least 12 months from initiation of treatment. 
The dosing regimen for our Phase 2 clinical trial included an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase, consisting of three weekly treatments and then nine weeks of no treatment repeated every three months for at least one year. There were two treatment groups in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Treatment Arm A consisted of 23 patients, of which 22 were ultimately evaluable as one patient violated eligibility requirements early in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Twenty-two patients in the induction phase 
received six consecutive once-weekly instillations of 30 mg of Vicineum. At the three-month assessment, patients with residual disease but no disease progression-where disease progression was defined as being muscle invasive-were eligible for either a second induction phase or a maintenance phase, which consisted of three consecutive once-weekly instillations repeated every three months for at least one year. Of the 13 patients who did not achieve a CR at the three-month assessment, nine patients elected additional treatment. From these nine, two became CRs after receiving maintenance dosing. Treatment Arm B was added to evaluate a longer induction cycle using the same dose. In Treatment Arm B, 23 patients in the induction phase received 12 consecutive once-weekly instillations of 30 mg Vicineum. At the three-month assessment, the combined CR rate for both treatment arms was 40%. At the 12-month assessment, the CR rate in Treatment Arm A was 13%, but 17% in Treatment Arm B. Of those patients who did not achieve a CR at the three-month assessment, 73% had either a reduction in tumor size or did not experience further tumor growth.
The data below shows the percentage change in surface area of cancer within the bladder, based on bladder mapping data utilizing cystoscopy in 40 patients. The following charts demonstrate the responses in this Phase 2 clinical trial in Treatment Arm A and Treatment Arm B:
This Phase 2 clinical trial was completed in September 2009.
Near the completion of this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2009, Valstar was re-launched in the United States for the treatment of BCG-refractory CIS bladder cancer in patients for whom immediate cystectomy would be associated with unacceptable morbidity or mortality. However, because physicians were not widely prescribing Valstar to their patients and it was not an approved therapy in Europe, this disrupted our originally designed clinical path of a head-to-head pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicineum against Valstar. Due to the uncertainty of the standard of care in this space, our efforts were put on hold until a clear clinical path was established. In May 2013, the FDA co-sponsored a public workshop where it evaluated potential trial designs for the development of therapies for NMIBC and specifically provided regulatory guidance supporting the idea that a single-arm clinical trial could provide sufficient evidence of benefit if the results were robust. The panel suggested it is acceptable to include high-risk papillary patients without CIS in a clinical trial with CIS patients because the clinical management and outcome if left untreated is considered to be the same. In September 2014, we conducted an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and, consistent with our interactions with the FDA during this meeting, refocused our resources to commence an open-label, non-randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicineum in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, which ended up being our Phase 3 VISTA Trial.
Safety data
We believe that our safety data from 110 patients in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials support further development of Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC BCG failures. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigators to be related to Vicineum during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC BCG failures. There was one Grade 5 serious adverse event, or death, which was determined by the clinical investigator to be unrelated to Vicineum. The most common reported treatment-related adverse events were an abnormally frequent passage of small amounts of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination, the majority of which were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. No patients discontinued treatment due to a Vicineum-related adverse event during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.
Outside of United States ("OUS") Business Development Partnering
Greater China
On July 30, 2020, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Qilu Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd. ("Qilu") pursuant to which we granted Qilu an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by us, to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum 
for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and other types of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We also granted Qilu a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing sublicense, under certain other intellectual property licensed by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum in Greater China. We retain (i) development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world excluding Greater China, the Middle East and North Africa region (“MENA”) and Turkey and (ii) manufacturing rights with respect to Vicineum in the rest of the world excluding Greater China.
During 2020, we received a total of $10 million in net proceeds associated with the Qilu License Agreement. We are also entitled to receive up to an additional $23 million upon the achievement of certain technology transfer, development and regulatory milestones, as well as a 12% royalty based upon annual net sales of Vicineum in Greater China. The royalties are payable upon the first commercial sale of Vicineum in a region and continuing until the latest of (i) twelve years after the first commercial sale of Vicineum in such region, (ii) the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering or claiming the composition of matter, method of treatment, or method of manufacture of Vicineum in such region, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory or data exclusivity for Vicineum in such region. The royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances, including when there is no valid claim of a licensed patent that covers Vicineum in a particular region or no data or regulatory exclusivity of Vicineum in a particular region. 
Qilu is responsible for all costs related to developing, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing Vicineum for the prevention and treatment of cancers including, but not limited to, NMIBC and various sub-types of NMIBC (the “Field”) in Greater China. Qilu is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize Vicineum in the Field in Greater China. A joint development committee was established between us and Qilu to coordinate and review the development, manufacturing and commercialization plans with respect to Vicineum in Greater China. We and Qilu also executed the terms and conditions of a supply agreement and related quality agreement pursuant to which we will manufacture or have manufactured and supply Qilu with all quantities of Vicineum necessary for Qilu to develop and commercialize Vicineum in the Field in Greater China until we have completed manufacturing technology transfer to Qilu and approval of a Qilu manufactured product by the National Medical Products Administration in China ("NMPA") for Vicineum has been obtained.
The Qilu License Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis on the date of the expiration of all applicable Royalty Terms. Either party may terminate the Qilu License Agreement for the other party’s material breach following a cure period or upon certain insolvency events. Qilu has the right to receive a refund of all amounts paid to us in the event the Qilu License Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. The Qilu License Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations for a transaction of this nature.
The Investigational New Drug application ("IND") for Vicineum submitted by Qilu to the Center for Drug Evaluation of the China National Medical Products Administration was accepted for review in January 2021 and approved in March 2021, resulting in a $3 million milestone payment from Qilu, the first milestone payment out of the $23 million in potential milestone payments. We recorded $2.8 million (net of VAT) as license revenue during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. 
In June 2021, the Qilu License Agreement was recognized by Shandong Province, Bureau of Science and Technology as "Technology Transfer". An agreement that is designated as a Technology Transfer shall be entitled to a tax incentive of value-added tax ("VAT") recovery. As such, we recorded $0.9 million of revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2021 for additional purchase price resulting from Qilu's obligation to pay Sesen an amount equal to its recovery of VAT. We will not be subject to VAT on future potential milestone payments. 
On July 20, 2021 we and Qilu announced the enrollment of the first patient in China in a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Vicineum in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The open-label, single-arm, multi-center bridging trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vicineum in approximately 53 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary disease, high-grade Ta papillary disease or T1 papillary disease of any grade. Patients will be required to have failed previous treatment with BCG for inclusion in the trial. The primary endpoints are the complete response rate (for CIS patients) and the recurrence-free rate (for papillary patients) at six months, with the complete response rate and the recurrence-free rate at three months, safety and tolerability as the secondary endpoints. Based on the Qilu License Agreement, the trial is being run at the sole cost of Qilu.
MENA
On November 30, 2020, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC, to develop and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the MENA region (20 countries in the Middle East and North Africa). In consideration for the rights granted by us, Hikma agreed to pay to us an upfront payment, sales related milestones payments, and royalties on net sales in the MENA region for the term of the Hikma License Agreement. 
Turkey
On August 5, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with EIP pursuant to which we granted EIP an exclusive license to register and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are entitled to receive an upfront payment of $1.5 million. We are in the process of amending the license agreement to defer payment of the upfront payment to coincide with the potential FDA approval of Vicineum. We are also eligible to receive additional regulatory and commercial milestone payments of $2.0 million and are entitled to receive a 30% royalty on net sales in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. 
Vicineum for the Treatment of SCCHN
Vicineum (formerly referred to as Proxinium in publications, focused on this clinical setting), is also being developed as a treatment for patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN who have received at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. To treat SCCHN, Vicineum is administered via injection directly into the targeted tumor, or intratumoral injection. Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA and Fast Track designation from the FDA.
In our two Phase 1 clinical trials encompassing 44 patients treated with Vicineum, a complete resolution or reduction in size of injected tumors was observed in 16 of the 30 evaluable patients (53%) with EpCAM-expressing tumors as assessed by the investigators’ clinical measurements, the investigators' overall assessment including qualitative changes and assessment of available radiologic data. An additional 27% of evaluable patients had stable disease and, therefore, the results indicate an overall tumor control rate of approximately 80%. In addition, three out of the four patients with CRs of injected tumors had regression or complete resolution of adjacent non-injected lesions. Vicineum was generally well-tolerated during the clinical trials. Dose-limiting toxicity in the Phase 1 clinical trials was transaminase elevation in liver enzymes.
In our clinical trials involving Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN, we also observed some stabilization, partial reduction and complete resolution of non-injected tumors. We believe that TFPT mediated killing of cancer cells occurs via a mechanism known as ICD, which is known to enhance the presentation of neoantigens to the immune system. We believe that this, combined with the immunogenic nature of our cytotoxic protein payload creates a heightened immune response, wherein naive cytotoxic T-cells are stimulated by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, presenting tumor cell surface antigens following the death of cancer cells. We believe that this anti-tumor response may complement checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
In our clinical trials involving Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN, there were no Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigator to be related to Vicineum. The serious adverse events (Grade 3 and Grade 4) that were reported in the clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN and were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment consisted of abnormal tumor growth, anorexia, cancer pain, decrease in red blood cells, difficulty swallowing, elevated calcium levels, facial pain, fatigue, high blood sugar, influenza like illness, injection site pain, liver function abnormalities, low albumin level, low sodium concentration, nausea, rash, swelling, tumor hemorrhage and tumor necrosis. 
For the combined Phase 1 (VB4-101 and VB4-101A) and Phase 2 (VB4-845-01-IIA) studies, seven subjects died during the clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN, but none of the deaths were deemed to be Vicineum-related. Out of the four patients who discontinued treatment due to liver function test abnormalities, 2 subjects were in study VB4-101 and 2 were subjects were in VB4-101A). Four subjects withdrew from the clinical trials. Three of the four subjects withdrew at their request and one of the four subjects withdrew at the request of the investigator.
Phase 3 (VB4-845-01-lllA) VB4-845-01-lllA was a randomized, multicentre therapeutic confirmatory study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Vicineum plus BSC versus BSC alone in the treatment of patients with advanced SCCHN who had received at least 1 anti-cancer treatment regimen for advanced disease. One hundred and sixty-six of the approximately 292 patients were enrolled at 75 sites. The primary endpoint for the study was overall survival. A total of 166 patients had been randomized into the study. Of the 166 patients, 82 were randomized to the Vicineum treatment plus BSC arm and 84 patients were randomized to the BSC arm.
VB4-845-01-IIIA was terminated early due to a corporate decision unrelated to safety or efficacy. At the time of study termination, survival data was available for 133 of 142 patients that had been randomized. A total of 66 were enrolled on the BSC arm and 67 enrolled in the Vicineum plus BSC treatment arm. Of the 66 BSC patients enrolled in the BSC arm, there were 43 documented deaths in this treatment arm; the date of death was known for 36 patients and unknown for 7. Of the patients treated with Vicineum, 41 deaths were documented with the date of death known for 37 patients and unknown for 4. 
Interim safety data was available for 132 of 139 patients that had been randomized. One hundred and eleven patients reported at least 1 AE. Thirty-six patients reported 205 adverse events (AEs) that were treatment related. Most of the treatment-related AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Of the 205 treatment-related AEs reported, there were 23 Grade 3 events and 2 Grade 4 events. There were no Grade 5 related AEs reported. The 2 related Grade 4 events were 2 occurrences of tumour necrosis in 1 patient; both were considered probably related to the treatment. Most related AEs resolved on their own and did not require additional treatment. Others were treated with concomitant medications.
Four patients in the Vicineum plus BSC group reported Grade 3 increases in both ALT and AST. One patient reported a Grade 3 increase in ALT and another patient reported a Grade 3 increase in AST. All of the Grade 3 increases in ALT/AST occurred in the Vicineum plus BSC group. No Grade 4 increases in ALT/AST were reported. In 1 patient, Vicineum was discontinued due to liver function test abnormalities, in 1 patient Vicineum was interrupted due to liver function test abnormalities and in the last patient Vicineum was discontinued due to disease progression.
We have deferred further development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development and, if approved, the commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. We are also exploring collaborations for the development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN intellectual property portfolio that provides for an unextended patent term until 2036. See ‘‘Our Intellectual Property’’ below for additional details.
VB6-845d
Our lead systemically-administered product candidate, VB6-845d, is being developed as a treatment for multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors. VB6-845d is a TFPT consisting of an EpCAM targeting Fab genetically linked to deBouganin, which is administered by intravenous infusion. DeBouganin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis and helps circumvent multi-drug resistance mechanisms. EpCAM is over-expressed on the cell surface of many solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovarian and prostate. EpCAM overexpression has been shown to be involved in promoting malignant progression. In addition, EpCAM overexpression is associated with increased tumor grade, disease progression, increased proliferative phenotypes and diminished survival. EpCAM is also a cancer stem cell marker. A Phase 1 clinical trial conducted with VB6-845, the prior version of VB6-845d, revealed no clinically relevant immune response to the deBouganin payload. Five of seven patients (71.4%) maintained stable disease (meaning no change in tumor size from baseline) after one completed cycle of treatment (four weeks). Two patients had decreases in target tumor size, and one subject who continued treatment through a third cycle (12 weeks) maintained stable disease. Interim safety data from our Phase 1 clinical trial was consistent with expectations for the study population of patients with advanced solid tumors and the anticipated effects of targeted biological therapies containing immunogenic sequences.
Based upon the antibody responses directed against the Fab seen in our Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Russia and in the country of Georgia, we de-immunized the Fab portion of VB6-845 to create VB6-845d. In April 2016, we submitted an IND to the FDA in preparation of initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VB6-845d in patients with EpCAM-positive cancers in the United States. The IND was withdrawn in July 2016 after we received initial feedback from the FDA indicating that they had identified hold and non-hold deficiencies that needed to be addressed. In December 2016, we submitted a request for a pre-IND meeting to seek input on the manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical plans for VB6-845d prior to resubmitting an IND. In February 2017, the FDA provided guidance on our manufacturing and nonclinical plans for VB6-845d. Overall, we believe that our pre-clinical data and the interim Phase 1 clinical data support further clinical investigation of VB6-845d to explore whether it may fulfill the significant unmet medical need in the treatment of patients with EpCAM-positive solid tumors. Specifically, we believe that VB6-845d has potential to be a first-in-class TFPT capable of providing clinical benefit in these difficult to treat patient populations.
We believe that our TFPTs utilizing our de-immunized deBouganin payload may be enhanced if combined with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that deBouganin’s potential effect on cancer cells could promote an immunogenic response that may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors.
We have deferred further development of VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development and, if approved, commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. We are also exploring collaborations for VB6-845d.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our VB6-845d intellectual property portfolio that provides for an unextended patent term until at least June 2025 and, method of treatment patents and applications for VB6-845d are granted, until at least 2036. See ‘‘Our Intellectual Property’’ below for additional details.
LUMC
On December 8, 2020, we and Leiden University Medical Center (“LUMC”) agreed to the co-development of an imaging agent (the “Imaging Agent”) that is comprised of an antibody fragment of Vicineum™, and an imaging molecule supplied by LUMC. The Imaging Agent is designed to delineate tumor from normal tissue during surgery so that the tumor margin is clearly visible, thereby helping to ensure clear margins after surgical excision of cancerous tissue. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of the Imaging Agent was successfully completed by LUMC with favorable tolerability and demonstrated tumor detection, which we believe further supports the targeting specificity of Vicineum. We signed an agreement with LUMC whereby we have an option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to any intellectual property related to the Imaging Agent. 
EBI-031 - Out-License Agreement with Roche
In June 2016, we entered into the Roche License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to our patent rights and know-how related to our monoclonal antibody EBI-031 and all other IL-6 anti-IL antagonist monoclonal antibody technology owned by us (collectively, the “Licensed Intellectual Property”). Under the Roche License Agreement, Roche is required to continue developing, at its cost, EBI-031 and any other product made from the Licensed Intellectual Property that contains an IL-6 antagonist anti-IL monoclonal antibody (the “Roche Licensed Product”) and pursue ongoing patent prosecution, at its cost. At the time of the Roche License Agreement, EBI-031, which was derived using our previous AMP-Rx platform, was in pre-clinical development as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema and uveitis.
Financial Terms
We received from Roche an upfront license fee of $7.5 million in August 2016 upon the effectiveness of the Roche License Agreement following approval by our stockholders, and Roche agreed to pay up to an additional $262.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones with respect to up to two unrelated indications. Specifically, an aggregate amount of up to $197.5 million is payable to us for the achievement of specified milestones with respect to the first indication, consisting of (i) $72.5 million in development milestones, the next of which is $30.0 million for initiation of the first Phase III study, (ii) $50.0 million in regulatory milestones and (iii) $75.0 million in commercialization milestones. In September 2016, Roche paid us the first development milestone of $22.5 million as a result of the IND application for EBI-031 becoming effective on or before September 15, 2016.
In December 2021, a $20 million milestone was achieved due to Roche initiating a Phase II clinical trial. We invoiced Roche $20 million with payment terms of 30 days following the achievement of the corresponding milestone event, pursuant to the Roche License Agreement. In January 2022 the payment of $20 million was received.
Additional amounts of up to $65.0 million are payable upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones in a second indication. 
In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments in accordance with a tiered royalty rate scale, with rates ranging from 7.5% to 15% of net sales of potential future products containing EBI-031 and up to 50% of these rates for net sales of potential future products containing other IL-6 compounds, with each of the royalties subject to reduction under certain circumstances and to the buy-out options of Roche.
Buy-Out Options
The Roche License Agreement provides for two “option periods” during which Roche may elect to make a one-time payment to us and, in turn, terminate its diligence, milestone and royalty payment obligations under the Roche License Agreement. Specifically, (i) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the first dosing ("Initiation") in the first Phase 2 study for a Roche Licensed Product until the day before Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Roche Licensed Product, in which case Roche is required to pay us $135.0 million within 30 days after Roche’s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, or (ii) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the day after Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Roche Licensed Product until the day before the acceptance for review by the FDA or other regulatory authority of a BLA or similar application for marketing approval for a Roche Licensed Product in either the United States or in the EU, in which case Roche is required to pay us, within 30 days after Roche’s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, $265.0 million, which amount would be reduced to $220.0 million if none of our patent rights containing a composition of matter claim covering any compound or Roche Licensed Product has issued in the EU. 
Termination
Either we or Roche may each terminate the Roche License Agreement if the other party breaches any of its material obligations under the Roche License Agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period. Roche may terminate the Roche License Agreement following effectiveness by providing advance written notice to us or by providing written notice if we are debarred, disqualified, suspended, excluded, or otherwise declared ineligible from certain federal or state agencies or programs. We may terminate the Roche License Agreement if, prior to the first filing of a BLA for a Roche Licensed Product, there is a period of 12 months where Roche is not conducting sufficient development activities with respect to the products made from the Licensed Intellectual Property.
Clinical Development
In July 2019, Roche reported that it started a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravitreal EBI-031 monotherapy in patients with diabetic macular edema. Further, Roche reported that once determined, an extended cohort will be dosed with the optimal dose of EBI-031 while another arm of the trial will test EBI-031 in combination with Lucentis (ranibizumab) following intravitreal administration in patients with diabetic macular edema.
In December 2021, Roche reported that it started enrollment of two Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with diabetic macular edema (“DME”). The first clinical trial, BP43445 (NCT05151731), is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, active comparator-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of EBI-031 administered intravitreally in patients with DME. The second clinical trial, BP43464 (NCT05151744), is a combination trial to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of EBI-031 with ranibizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor) compared with ranibizumab alone in DME patients. For both trials, only one eye will be chosen as the trial eye and the duration of the trial will be 52 weeks.
Our Intellectual Property 
We currently own or exclusively license approximately 13 families of patents and applications, which generally relate to our TFPT-based product candidates and evolving our platform of targeting agents, cytotoxins (such as deBouganin) and linker technologies.

Our Vicineum License Agreements
In-License Agreement with Zurich
Overview and Exclusivity
We have a License Agreement with the University of Zurich ("Zurich") which grants us exclusive license rights, with the right to sublicense, to make, have made, use and sell under certain patents primarily directed to our targeting agent, including an EpCAM chimera and related immunoconjugates and methods of use and manufacture of the same. These patents cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Upon receipt of the CRL regarding our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we became obligated to pay $0.5 million in a milestone payment to Zurich. We are also obligated to pay up to a 4% royalty on the net product sales for products covered by or manufactured using a method covered by a valid claim in the Zurich patent rights. Royalties owed to Zurich will be reduced if the total royalty rate owed by us to Zurich and any other third party is 10% or greater, provided that the royalty rate to Zurich may not be less than 2% of net sales. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the expiration or termination of the last of the Zurich patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of a product. There is no obligation to pay royalties in a country if there is no valid claim that covers the product or a method of manufacturing the product. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an expense of $0.3 million for the achievement of the development milestone related to the submission of our BLA for Vicineum with the FDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an expense of $0.5 million for the regulatory milestone related to receipt of the CRL from the FDA in August 2021. 
Patent Rights
We are responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights, at our sole expense, while Zurich is afforded reasonable opportunities to review and comment on such activities. If appropriate, we shall apply for an extension of the term of any licensed patent where available, for example, in at least the United States, Europe and Japan. In the event of any substantial infringement of the patent rights, we may request Zurich to take action to enforce the licensed patents against third parties. If the infringing activity is not abated within 90 days and Zurich has elected not to take legal action, we may bring suit in our own name (and in Zurich’s name, if necessary). Such action will be at our own expense and Zurich will have the opportunity to join at its own expense. Recoveries from any action shall generally belong to the party bringing the suit, but (a) in the event that we bring the action and an acceptable settlement or monetary damages are awarded, then Zurich will be reimbursed for any amount that would have been due to Zurich if the products sold by the infringer actually had been sold by us, or (b) in the event a joint legal action is brought, then the parties shall share the expense and recoveries shall be shared in proportion to the share of expense paid by the respective party. Each party is required to cooperate with the other in litigation proceedings at the expense of the party bringing the action.
Term and Termination
The term of the Zurich License Agreement expires as of the expiration date of the last patent to expire within the Zurich patent rights. We are currently projecting an expiration date for the United States licensed patents in June 2025, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available on a jurisdictional basis. Zurich has the right to terminate the Zurich License Agreement if we breach any obligation of the agreement and fail to cure such breach within the applicable cure periods. We have the right to terminate the Zurich License Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving 90 days written notice to Zurich.
In-License Agreement with Micromet
Overview
We have a License Agreement with Micromet AG ("Micromet"), now part of Amgen, Inc., which grants us nonexclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products. These patents cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Under the terms of the License Agreement with Micromet, as of December 31, 2021, we may be obligated to pay up to €2.4 million in milestone payments for the first product candidate that achieves applicable regulatory and sales-based development milestones (approximately $2.7 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2021). We are also required to pay up to a 3.5% royalty on the net sales for products covered by the agreement, which includes Vicineum. The royalty rate owed to Micromet in a particular country will be reduced to 1.5% if there are no valid claims covering the product in that country. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim covering the product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. Finally, we are required to pay to Micromet an annual license maintenance fee of €50,000 (approximately $56,625 at exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2021), which can be credited towards any royalty payment we owe to Micromet. We recorded an expense of €0.7 million ($0.9 million) related to achievement of a development milestone in the three months ended December 31, 2020, due to the submission of our BLA for Vicineum with the FDA in December 2020. We recorded an expense of €0.5 million ($0.6 million) related to the submission of the MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum™ in the first quarter of 2021.
Patent Rights
Micromet, at its sole expense, is responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights. In any patent enforcement action initiated by Micromet, we may be required, upon the request of Micromet and at Micromet’s expense, to provide reasonable assistance to Micromet with respect to such enforcement action.
Term and Termination
The term of the Micromet License Agreement expires as of the expiration of any royalty obligations under the License Agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the Micromet License Agreement if the other party fails to comply with any of its material obligations under the Micromet License Agreement and fails to cure such non-compliance within the applicable cure periods.
In-License Agreement with XOMA
Overview
We have a License Agreement with XOMA Ireland Limited ("XOMA") which grants us non-exclusive rights to certain XOMA patent rights and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems. These patents and related know-how cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Under the terms of the License Agreement with XOMA, we are required to pay up to $0.25 million in milestone payments for a product candidate that incorporates know-how under the license and achieves applicable clinical development milestones. Based on current clinical status, we anticipate that these milestones may be triggered by Vicineum’s clinical development pathway. We are also required to pay a 2.5% royalty on the net sales for products incorporating XOMA’s technology, which includes Vicineum. We have the right to reduce the amount of royalties owed to XOMA on a country-by-country basis by the amount of royalties paid to other third parties, provided that the royalty rate to XOMA may not be less than 1.75% of net sales. In addition, the foregoing royalty rates are reduced by 50% with respect to products that are not covered by a valid patent claim in the country of sale. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim covering the product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country.
Patent Rights
XOMA, at its sole expense, is responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights. In any patent enforcement action initiated by XOMA, we may be required, upon the request of XOMA and at XOMA’s expense, to provide reasonable assistance to XOMA with respect to such enforcement action.

Our Manufacturing
We lease a 31,100 square foot manufacturing, laboratory, warehouse and office facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. We have three 15-liter fermenters, one 30-liter fermenter, one 150-liter fermenter, one 500-liter fermenter and one 1,500-liter fermenter. Our classified fermentation suite and post-production processing capabilities were dedicated to producing our pre-clinical study and clinical trial batches of Vicineum. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicineum necessary for our Phase 
3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities at our facility in Winnipeg and completed the technology transfer process to outsource future Vicineum clinical and commercial to third-party manufacturers.
Fujifilm and Baxter 
In October 2018, we entered into a Master Bioprocessing Services Agreement with Fujifilm (the “Fujifilm MSA”) for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug substance production.
In November 2019, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Baxter (the “Baxter CSA”) for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug product production. 
In August 2020, we completed manufacturing of the drug substance process performance qualification (“PPQ”) batches at Fujifilm and in September 2020, we successfully completed the drug product PPQ batches at Baxter. All of the completed drug substance PPQ batches and drug product PPQ batches met all quality acceptance criteria. 
In December 2020, we received and analyzed all of the analytical comparability test results from the drug substance and drug product PPQ batches. For analytical comparability, we conducted testing across four categories: release testing, biophysical characterization, forced degradation studies, and stability studies. This approach is in alignment with requirements of the FDA, the EMA and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The test results for Vicineum produced by Fujifilm and Baxter were found to be highly comparable to our supply of Vicineum produced at our Winnipeg facility. 
On October 29, 2021, at the CMC Type A Meeting, the FDA confirmed that Vicineum manufactured using the proposed commercial process is comparable to Vicineum used in prior clinical trials and confirmed that we can utilize Vicineum manufactured during process validation for any future clinical trials needed to address issues raised in the CRL regarding the BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and that any of these future trials can proceed while addressing CMC issues raised in the CRL.
In January 2022, we signed a Scope of Work ("SOW #11") with Fujifilm under the Fujifilm MSA for the manufacturing of commercial batches of Vicineum in 2022 and 2023. 
We intend to use Vicineum produced by Fujifilm and Baxter for any future clinical trials of Vicineum, including the additional Phase 3 clinical trial, and, if approved, for commercial supply.
Qilu
In June 2021, we entered into a Global Supply Agreement with Qilu pursuant to which Qilu will be part of the manufacturing network for, if approved, global commercial supply of Vicineum drug substance and drug product.
Our Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid and significant technological change and has a strong emphasis on developing proprietary products. While we believe that our next generation TFPT platform, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations; specifically with companies, institutions and organizations that are actively researching and developing products that attach proprietary cell-killing payloads to antibodies for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Our competitors include, but are not limited to:
•NMIBC: Merck & Co., Inc. (Keytruda/pembrolizumab and BCG) (approved drugs), Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Valstar/valrubicin) (approved drug), FerGene Inc. (Adstiladrin/nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3)), Medical Enterprises Ltd. (Synergo RITE plus mitomycin C), Aadi, LLC (ABI-009), ImmunityBio (Anktiva/N-803 in combination with BCG), CG Oncology. (CG0070), Theralase Technologies Inc. (TLD-1433 photodynamic compound), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Opdivo/nivolumab with or without BCG or BMS-986205), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Tecentriq/Atezolizumab), AstraZeneca (Imfinzi/durvalumab with or without BCG or External Beam Radiotherapy), Eli Lilly and Company (Gemcitabine) and Telormedix SA (Vesimune); Pfizer, Inc. (Sasanlimab);
•SCCHN: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Opdivo/nivolumab) (approved drug), Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck (Erbitux, pembrolizumab) (approved drugs);
•Multiple types of solid tumors: Amgen Inc. (Panitumumab) (approved drug), Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Sorafenib) (approved drug), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck (Erbitux) (approved drug), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Bevacizumab) (approved drug), Genentech, Inc. (Bevacizumab, Erlotinib and Trastuzumab) (approved drugs), Pfizer, Inc. (Sunitinib) and Trion Research GmbH (Removab); and
•In addition to competition from alternative treatments, we may also face competition from products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, our product candidates. Biosimilar products are expected to become available over the coming years. Even if our product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive biosimilar products if any have been approved by then and insurers or other third-party payors may encourage or even require the use of lower priced biosimilar products. Even if our treatments receive market authorization, they may not be listed on the formularies of payors (public or private insurers) or reimbursed. This may impact the uptake of the drug as a treatment option for patients and/or the price at which the drug can be sold at. Further, if the drug is reimbursed it may be at a narrower indication than the full scope of market authorization.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. These competitors are also active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Moreover, specialized biologics, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the drug design, effectiveness against multi-drug resistance mechanisms, efficacy, safety, price and convenience of our product candidates.
Government Regulation 
As a clinical-stage biologics company, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other national, supranational, state, provincial and local regulatory agencies. We are also subject to extensive regulation by similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we operate. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA") and their implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, post-approval monitoring and reporting, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval to market our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope to that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way through the European Commission following the opinion of the EMA, but country-specific regulation in the individual European Union Member States ("EU Member States") remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with 
appropriate supranational, federal, state, provincial, local and non-US statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and we may not be successful in any given jurisdiction.
US Government Regulation
In the United States, drug products are regulated by the FDA under the FDCA and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the PHSA. Drug products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. A failure to comply with any applicable requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, including, among other things, the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board ("IRB") of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, or administrative, civil and/or criminal investigation, penalties or prosecution.
In the United States, all of our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. Manufacturers of biologics may also be subject to state and local regulation.
The steps required before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally include:
•completion of pre-clinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies, some in compliance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulations, and the Animal Welfare Act administered and enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture;
•submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
•approval by an IRB before each trial may be initiated at each clinical site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials under protocols submitted to the FDA and reviewed and approved by each IRB, conducted in accordance with federal regulations and current Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") to establish the safety, purity and potency of the biologic for each targeted indication;
•submission of a BLA to the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
•FDA review and approval of a BLA.
Pre-clinical Studies
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including, as applicable, GLP and the Animal Welfare Act. The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA evaluates the IND to determine whether there is an adequate basis for starting the product candidate in initial clinical trials, and the IND must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced. Additional pre-clinical studies may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during this 30-day period the FDA does not raise any concerns or issues that must be addressed prior to the commencement of clinical trials or does not impose a clinical hold, the IND becomes effective 30 days following the FDA’s receipt of the IND and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation and must be conducted in compliance with (i) federal regulations, (ii) GCP standards, which set safeguards to protect the rights and health of patients and establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting results of clinical trials, and (iii) protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if any. Non-US studies conducted under an IND generally must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. The informed written consent of each study patient must be obtained before the patient may begin participation in the clinical trial. The study protocol, study plan, and informed consent forms for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each clinical site, and the study must be conducted under the auspices of an IRB for each trial site. Investigators and IRBs must also comply with FDA regulations and guidelines, including those regarding oversight of study patient informed consent, complying with the study protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. 
The clinical trial program for a product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of a product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted in healthy human subjects, but in some situations are conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. These clinical trials are generally designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetic ("PK") properties and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s PK properties and pharmacological effects may be obtained to inform and support the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80;
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to obtain initial evidence of effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication(s) in patients with the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to gather additional information on possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants; and
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product candidate has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate, although a single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain instances.
The decision to suspend or terminate development of a product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, by an IRB, or by a company for various reasons and during any phase of clinical trials. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by a data safety monitoring board ("DSMB"), which is an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor to evaluate at designated points in time whether or not a trial may move forward and/or should be modified. These decisions are based on unblinded access to data from the ongoing trial and generally involve determinations regarding the benefit-risk ratio for study patients and the scientific integrity and validity of the clinical trial.
In addition, there are requirements for the registration of certain clinical trials of product candidates on public registries, such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, and the submission of certain information pertaining to these trials, including clinical trial results, after trial completion.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, a sponsor submits extensive information about the product candidate to the FDA in the form of a BLA to request marketing approval for the product candidate in specified indications.
Biologics License Applications
In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. For example, in November 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document on developing new drugs and biologics for treating BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and finalized this guidance in February 2018. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing an original BLA, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial, subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. The FDA has 60 days from receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to accept for filing any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, in which case the BLA will have to be updated and resubmitted. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within 
six months of filing and 90% of standard applications within 10 months of filing, but the FDA can and frequently does extend this review timeline to consider certain later-submitted information or information intended to clarify or supplement information provided in the initial submission. 
The FDA may not complete its review or approve a BLA within these established goal review times. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured or the facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and distribution process and will not approve the product candidate unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain BLAs must include an assessment, generally based on clinical trial data, of the safety and effectiveness of the biological product in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at a company’s request or by its own initiative, including waivers for certain products not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. Products with orphan drug designation are exempt from these requirements for orphan-designated indications with no formal waiver process required.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a CRL. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. On August 13, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form and provided recommendations specific to additional clinical/statistical data and analyses in addition to CMC issues pertaining to a recent pre-approval inspection and product quality. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of a BLA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal is to review such resubmissions within two or six months of receipt, depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval of a resubmitted BLA. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include Medication Guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and also may include elements to assure safe use ("ETASU"). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the biologic. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the biologic’s safety, purity, or potency, which can be costly.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplemental BLA before the change can be implemented. A supplemental BLA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing a supplemental BLA as it does in reviewing a new BLA.
Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, new or modified government requirements, including from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development or affect our ability to maintain product approvals we have obtained.
Biosimilars and Market Exclusivity
Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), the FDA can approve products that are biosimilar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. To be biosimilar, a biological product must be highly similar to an already-licensed FDA biological product, or reference product and can have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity and potency from the reference product. An interchangeable biosimilar product must meet additional standards for interchangeability and, if approved, may be substituted 
for the reference product. At this juncture, it is unclear whether any product biosimilar deemed ‘‘interchangeable’’ by the FDA, in fact, will be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, a manufacturer may file an application for approval of a ‘‘biosimilar’’ version of the innovator product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA under the PHSA. The BPCIA also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA. Although the patents for the reference biologic may be challenged by the biosimilar applicant during that time period pursuant to the BPCIA statutory patent challenge framework, no biosimilar or interchangeable product will be licensed by the FDA until the end of the exclusivity period. The first biologic product candidate submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against any other determinations of interchangeability to the reference product for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the interchangeable biosimilar product, (ii) 18 months after approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the interchangeable biosimilar product applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the reference product’s patents, and (iv) 42 months after approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of generic drugs. The FDA has published several guidance documents providing direction on developing and obtaining approval of biosimilar product candidates. The guidance documents to date explain, among other things, that the FDA will approve a biosimilar product if there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. A determination of biosimilarity may be based upon: (1) analytical studies showing that the biological product is highly similar to, with no clinically meaningful differences from, the reference product, (2) animal studies, including toxicity assessments, and/or (3) a clinical trial or trials (including assessment of immunogenicity and PKs) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and for which licensure is sought for the biological product. The FDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to developing the data and information needed to support biosimilarity. At each step, the sponsor should evaluate the extent of residual uncertainty of biosimilarity that remains and incorporate the FDA’s advice for additional studies to address remaining uncertainty. To meet the higher standard for interchangeability the sponsor must demonstrate, in addition to biosimilarity, that the proposed biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result and, if administered more than once to any given patient, the safety risk and potential for diminished efficacy associated with switching between the proposed biological product and the reference product is not greater than continuing to use the reference product. A biological product that is determined to be interchangeable may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. In March 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA, and it has approved other biosimilar products since then. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, the approval of a biosimilar to one of our products could have a material impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products, if approved by the FDA.
The "Purple Book," first published by the FDA in September 2014, lists biological products, including any biosimilar and interchangeable biological products licensed by the FDA under the PHSA. The lists include the date a biological product was licensed under Section 351(a) of the PHSA and whether the FDA evaluated the biological product for reference product exclusivity under Section 351(k)(7) of the PHSA. The Purple Book will also enable a user to see whether a biological product licensed under Section 351(k) of the PHSA has been determined by the FDA to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference biological product. Biosimilar and interchangeable biological products licensed under Section 351(k) of the PHSA will be listed under the reference product to which biosimilarity or interchangeability was demonstrated.
Advertising and Promotion
The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of biologics through standards and regulations for, among other things, direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A biologic cannot be promoted before it is approved. After approval, promotion of a biologic can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA.
Healthcare providers are permitted, however, to prescribe products for unapproved uses (also known as ‘‘off-label’’ uses) – that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the product’s labeling – because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA restricts manufacturers’ communications regarding unapproved uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a product for an unapproved use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding unapproved uses under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in 
this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), or the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), as well as state authorities. Such enforcement action could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products.
Post-approval Regulation
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the product. In addition, as a holder of an approved BLA, a company would be required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products.
The manufacturing of our product candidates is required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. Biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. The FDA and certain state agencies periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product or the manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions may include suspension of product manufacturing until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a ‘‘consent decree,’’ which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. Other potential consequences include interruption of production, issuance of warning letters or other enforcement letters, refusal to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, product seizure or detention, and injunctions or imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties.
In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation, correction, and reporting of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third-party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, such as additional post-market clinical trials to assess new safety risks or distribution-related or other restrictions under a REMS.
Patent Term Extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our US patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. The provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for patent term extension for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Many other countries also provide for patent term extensions or similar extensions of patent protection for biologic products. For example, in Japan, it may be possible to extend the patent term for up to five years and in Europe, it may be possible to obtain a supplementary patent certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any non-US official, political party or candidate 
for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the non-US entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
European Union and other International Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent authorities of the EU Member States where the clinical trial is conducted and to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
Marketing Authorization Application for Biologic Medicinal Products
To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application.
In the EU, a marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single country). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and certain biologic products and optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health.
In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA which will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Based on the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission takes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization which permits the marketing of a product in all 27 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association States - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA CHMP.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as the United Kingdom and countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCPs, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable non-US regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Advertising, Promotion and Compliance
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU laws and EU Member States’ national laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Other EU Member State national legislation may also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics ("SmPC"), as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. The SmPC forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion and is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These penalties could include the imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or a disease or condition that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the biologic would be recovered from sales in the United States.
In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application for a biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the product sponsor is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet patient needs. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different disease or condition.
In the EU, medicinal products: (a) that are used to diagnose, treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU; or (b) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation in the EU. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved by the European Commission before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once designated, Orphan medicinal product designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Moreover, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization, if the product continues to be designated as an orphan medicinal product upon grant of the marketing authorization. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. This period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years, at the end of the fifth year, if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval or marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, nor shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA.
Expedited Programs in the United States and Other Jurisdictions
In the United States, a product may be granted Fast Track designation if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. With Fast Track designation, the sponsor may be eligible for more frequent opportunities to obtain the FDA’s feedback, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This Rolling Review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Even if a product receives Fast Track designation, the designation can be rescinded and provides no assurance that a product will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously than would otherwise have been the case, or that the product will be approved at all.
FDA may designate a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if it finds that the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other product candidates or approved products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies, more frequent interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for Priority Review. We may apply for breakthrough therapy designation for some of our product candidates. However, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate 
may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for designation.
Accelerated approval under FDA regulations allows a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies to be approved on the basis of either an intermediate clinical endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for confirmatory clinical trials to be conducted with due diligence to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm clinical benefit and for all promotional materials to be submitted to the FDA for review prior to dissemination.
The FDA may grant Priority Review designation to a product candidate, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from FDA filing, or eight months from the sponsor’s submission. Priority Review may be granted where a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to available therapy. If criteria are not met for Priority Review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from FDA filing or 12 months from sponsor submission. Priority Review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding ‘‘clock stops,’’ when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which should be justified and assessed on a case-by-case basis. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of CHMP is given within 150 days.
Vicineum has received Fast Track and Priority Review designations from the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of SCCHN.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some non-US jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any partners, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any partners, may receive for any approved products.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, may revise reimbursement and implement coverage restrictions. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. 
In addition, in March 2010, President Obama signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the "ACA") substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA has impacted existing government healthcare programs and has resulted in the development of new programs. For example, the ACA provides for Medicare payment for performance initiatives.    
    Among the ACA's provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
•an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biological products;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program ("MDRP") to 23.1% for innovator drugs and 13% for non-innovator drugs of the average manufacturer price ("AMP");
•a new methodology by which AMP is calculated and reported by manufacturers for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a new partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients ("Medicare Part D") coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of 
applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D (subsequent legislation increased this amount to 70% effective as of January 1, 2019);
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act's 340B drug pricing program;
•new requirements to report to CMS annually specifying financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any ‘‘payments or other transfers of value’’ made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;
•a new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•a mandatory non-deductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents;
•establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payments and service delivery models; and
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research
Certain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022). On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed a law that provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year.
The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates. For example, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, Congress is currently considering changes that could affect our overall rebate liability. Changes under consideration include a drug price negotiation program, Medicare Part B and Part D inflation rebates, under which manufacturers would owe rebates if the average sales price or average manufacturer price of a drug were to increase faster than the pace of inflation, and Part D benefit redesign, including a proposed new manufacturer discount program.
It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a biologic may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the biologic. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the products approved by the FDA, or comparable non-US regulatory authorities for a particular indication or if a product is included it may not be listed on the formulary for all the indications or it may be listed on a narrower basis than what is approved by the FDA, or comparable non-US regulatory authorities. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA, or other comparable non-US regulatory authorities’ approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In 2003, the United States Congress enacted legislation creating Medicare Part D, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing or modify manufacturer discounts. For example, Congress is currently considering legislation that would sunset the current Part D discount program and replace it with a new manufacturer discount program, effective 2024. Congress further could enact a Medicare Part D inflation rebate, under which manufacturers would owe rebates if the average manufacturer price of a drug were to increase faster than the pace of inflation.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Further, there are national, provincial and territorial formularies funded by government healthcare systems, in addition to formularies for private payors (private insurers) and hospitals or hospital groups. Listing on the formularies and price depend on evidence and submissions regarding the cost-benefit of the drug and comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies and is often subject to negotiations.
In the EU, once a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product the applicant is required to engage in pricing and reimbursement discussions and negotiate with a separate pricing authority in each of the EU Member States. The EU Member States governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of the EU Member States may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly pharmaceuticals, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Furthermore, many EU Member States and other non-US countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. The EU Member States have discretion to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. We may face competition for our products, if approved, from lower priced products in non-US countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Health Technology Assessment ("HTA") of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in European Economic Area ("EEA") countries is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") Value Assessment for Cancer Treatments
On May 31, 2016, ASCO published a framework to assess the value of cancer treatment options. The framework was developed in response to concern that new, expensive cancer treatments may not be supported by adequate medical evidence. The purpose of the framework is to provide a standardized quantification of cancer treatments and assist oncologists and patients in deciding between new cancer treatments and the standard of care. The framework takes into account a medication’s (i) efficacy, (ii) safety and (iii) cost, to derive an overall treatment value. 
While we believe that the safety and efficacy profiles of our product candidates are potentially better than that of the standard of care and, if approved, we intend to price our products competitively, we do not know how the data will be assessed by ASCO. It is also unknown whether use of this application could adversely affect the assessment of any of our product candidates. If this framework were adopted and utilized by payors and physicians, and if Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG were to receive low ratings, this could adversely affect the price and reimbursement of Vicineum, if approved, reduce prescriptions and harm our business. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by United States federal and state governments and by governments in non-US jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have described below some of the key federal, state and non-US healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. Liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False 
Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and for allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, a claim can be deemed to be false due to failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements material to the government’s payment decision. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false claim or statement. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes.
The fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, "HIPAA"), among other things, impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in our by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives.
Many states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual healthcare providers; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing. Some states prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain healthcare providers, and/or offering co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, in order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. 
HIPAA imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. 
Other jurisdictions have corresponding laws and regulations governing the handling of personal information and third-party communications that may be more or less stringent than those of the United States. 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual United States Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
If we participate in the MDRP, we will have certain price reporting obligations to the MDRP, and we may have obligations to report average sales price ("ASP") figures to the Medicare program. Under the MDRP, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds available for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates would be based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data would include AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that modified MDRP regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); provide definitions of “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions (beginning in 2022); and revise best price and AMP exclusions of manufacturer-sponsored patient benefit programs, including with respect to the potential inapplicability of such exclusions in the context of pharmacy benefit manager “accumulator” programs (beginning in 2023). 
Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the MDRP report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. For calendar quarters beginning January 1, 2022, manufacturers will be required to report the average sales price for certain drugs under the Medicare program regardless of whether they participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, starting in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to Medicare for single source drugs or biologicals, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under Medicare Part B and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages for units of discarded drug reimbursed by Medicare Part B in excess of 10 percent of total allowed charges under Medicare Part B for that drug. Manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125 percent of the refund amount. 
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Health Resources and Services Administration ("HRSA"), which administers the 340B program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement, pursuant to which manufacturers must report the 340B ceiling prices for their covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis. HRSA then publishes those prices to 340B covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution (“ADR”) process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. HRSA further could terminate a manufacturer’s agreement to participate in the 340B program for a failure to comply with 340B program requirements. In the event that HRSA were to terminate such an agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize.
In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its “covered drugs” (biologics or innovator drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory federal ceiling price. We also expect to participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, under which we would pay quarterly rebates to DoD for prescriptions of innovator drugs dispensed to Tricare beneficiaries through Tricare Retail network pharmacies. The requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount for each covered outpatient drug is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer’s submission to CMS of its current AMP and, in 
the case of innovator products, best price figures, for the quarter. If we participate in the MDRP and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the MDRP. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B program, and we may be obligated to issue refunds to covered entities. 
If we participate in the MDRP or our products are covered under Medicare Part B, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. We cannot assure you that our submissions, if we participate in these programs, will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Civil monetary penalties also can be applied if we are found to have intentionally charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize. 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including (depending on the applicable law) criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private ‘‘qui tam’’ actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a non-US country, we may be subject to similar non-US laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and more extensive reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States and by the United Kingdom's Bribery Act 2010. 
The national laws of certain EU Member States require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed. Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ("EFPIA") Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals. In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States.
If we fail to comply with applicable non-US regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Environmental and Safety Laws
We are subject to a variety of federal, provincial and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations involve such hazardous materials and produce such hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, provincial and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. Radioactive materials in Canada come under 
federal jurisdiction. Canada’s Nuclear Safety and Control Act 1997 c.9 contains a general prohibition against any activity, including possession of radioactive material, except in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in a federal license issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulation does however, exempt licensing requirements for small quantities of radioactive substances that either meet concentrations set out in a schedule to the Regulation or, for radioactive substances not set out in the schedule, that meet certain regulatory criteria. Our operations do not currently require a federal license issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Our operations in Canada may be subject to license approvals, notification requirements and investigation and enforcement for air and water and waste matters.
Corporate History and Acquisition of Viventia
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2008. We were formerly known as Denovo Therapeutics, Inc. and Newco LS14, Inc. before changing our name to Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. in February 2010 and again to Sesen Bio, Inc. in May 2018. 
In September 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Viventia Bio, Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, the shareholders of Viventia named therein (collectively, the "Selling Shareholders") and, solely in its capacity as seller representative, Clairmark Investments Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (“Clairmark”), pursuant to which we agreed to and simultaneously completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Viventia from the Selling Shareholders (the "Viventia Acquisition"). In connection with the closing of the Viventia Acquisition, we issued 4.0 million shares of our common stock to the Selling Shareholders according to their pro rata share of Viventia’s then-outstanding shares of common stock, which represented approximately 19.9% of our voting power as of immediately prior to the issuance of such shares of common stock. Clairmark is an affiliate of Leslie L. Dan, who served on our board of directors until his retirement in July 2019.
In connection with the Viventia Acquisition, we are obligated to pay to the Selling Shareholders certain post-closing contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified milestones and based upon net sales, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the acquisition agreement, including: (i) a one-time milestone payment of $12.5 million payable upon the first sale of Vicineum (the "Purchased Product"), in the United States; (ii) a one-time milestone payment of $7.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in any one of certain specified European countries; (iii) a one-time milestone payment of $3.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in Japan; and (iv) and quarterly earn-out payments equal to two percent (2%) of net sales of the Purchased Product during specified earn-out periods. Such earn-out payments are payable with respect to net sales in a country beginning on the date of the first sale in such country and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2033, and (ii) fifteen years after the date of such sale, subject to early termination in certain circumstances if a biosimilar product is on the market in the applicable country. 
Under the Share Purchase Agreement, we, our affiliates, licensees and subcontractors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, for the first seven years following the closing of the Viventia Acquisition, to achieve marketing authorizations throughout the world and, during the applicable earn-out period, to commercialize the Purchased Product in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Japan, China and Canada.
Human Capital
Our key human capital management objectives are to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. There are a limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense given the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies looking for similar personnel as well as universities and research institutions. We rely on our executive officers and other key employees to achieve our research, development and commercialization objectives and to successfully implement our business strategy. We also rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. 
We are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace in which our employees from all backgrounds can fully contribute to the growth and success of our business. We communicate shared values and leadership behaviors, which are expected of all employees. Additionally, every employee has an annual performance review and has opportunities to contribute to corporate goals. We rely on a variety of sources to fill open positions, including job boards and postings on our corporate website.
We have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health and employee wellbeing. We have adopted our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ("2014 Plan") and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to enable us and our subsidiaries to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants, provide those individuals with an incentive for productivity, and provide those individuals with an opportunity to share in our growth and value.
As of December 31, 2021, we had thirty-five full-time employees and no part-time employees, nine hold Ph.D. degrees and one is a veterinary doctor. This number consists of fifteen employees engaged in administration and twenty employees engaged in research and development (eight in clinical and regulatory, three in supply chain, five in manufacturing/engineering, and four in quality and support). Two of our employees are located in our corporate headquarters in Cambridge, fifteen of our employees are located in our Winnipeg facility, and five of our employees are located in our Philadelphia office. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 30% of our employees have continued to work at our Winnipeg facility, where we have adopted health screening, implemented socially distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols, and modified workspaces to reduce the potential for transmission of the virus. All other employees who do not require access to our facility to perform their work have been working from home during the pandemic.
