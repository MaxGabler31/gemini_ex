Item 1. Business
Overview



Elvictor Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on November 3, 2017 under the name of Thenablers, Inc. (“Thenablers”) and initially operated as an international business development organization with a focus on design and execution of market strategies for its clients. In October 2019, Konstantinos Galanakis (our Chief Executive Officer), Stavros Galanakis (our Vice President and Chairman of the Board), Christodoulos Tzoutzakis (our Chief Operating & Technology Officer) and Theodoros Chouliaras (serving as the Company’s CFO at that time) were appointed as directors of the Company, and all of the directors then serving in connection with the business of Thenablers resigned (Panagiotis Lazaretos, Sotirios Foutsis and Theofylaktos Petros Oikonomou). Those changes took place to promote the business by bringing in management with specific knowledge in line with current business of the Company. At the time of appointment of the new directors, Thenablers issued to Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis, Mr. Stavros Galanakis, Aikaterini Galanaki and Theodoros Chouliaras an aggregate of 80,000,000 shares of newly designated “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $30,000 and the transfer of all of the business of Elvictor Crew Management Ltd to the Company, including all existing crew management contracts, the transfer of which began in the fourth quarter of 2020 and concluded at the end of 2021. The 80,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which voted with the Company’s common stock, on an as-converted basis, and were converted into 395,220,000 shares of common stock issued to Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis and Mr. Stavros Galanakis on April 8, 2021, pursuant to the terms of a Settlement Agreement, resulted in a change in control of the Company.



On November 5, 2019, Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Stavros Galanakis as the Chairman of the Company. On December 13, 2019, with consent of the shareholders, the name of the Company was changed from “Thenablers, Inc.” to “Elvictor Group, Inc.” with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada. On February 27, 2020, upon receipt of FINRA’s approval, the Company’s trading symbol in the OTC Pink Open Market was changed to “ELVG.” 



On August 8, 2020, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Vari, Greece, called Elvictor Group Hellas Single Member SA. This subsidiary provides back-office services to the Company and its crew management subsidiaries in connection with human resources issues, drafting of agreements, tax and other accounting advice, and administrative support.



In September 2020, the Company began focusing its business operations on providing crew management services to vessels around the world. In October 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Ultra Shipmanagement, Inc., a Marshall Islands company (“Ultra Shipmanagement”) owned by Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis and Mr. Stavros Galanakis in consideration for the payment of $2,500 by the Company, upon which Ultra Shipmanagement, Inc., became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and through which we began offering ship management services. On January 10, 2022, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Cyprus, ELVG Crew Management Limited, which provides crew management services.



Together with our wholly owned crew management subsidiaries, Elvictor is a crewing and crew management company responsible for sourcing, recruitment, selection, deployment, scheduling, training, and on-going management of seafarers. Our services also include administrative functions related to crew management services, including payroll services, travel arrangements, and verifying the insurance coverage information of all onboarded seafarers. Our Company benefits from over 65 years of combined experience in various value adding activities of the shipping sector such as ship management, technical management, ship agency, crewing and crew management of Mr. Stavros Galanakis and Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis.



We currently manage over 2,500 seafarers of seven different nationalities who are aboard seven different ship types. On any one day, we manage over 250 seafarers traveling worldwide while processing over 500 multilingual applicants daily, supporting our clients.

Recent Developments



Since September 2020, the Company has entered into Crew Management Agreements (the “Crew Management Agreements”) with several vessel operators (the “Shipowners”), pursuant to which the Company performs standard crew management for the Shipowners’ vessels. The Crew Management Agreements continue until they are terminated by us or the Shipowners, where following a formal written notice of termination, the agreement shall terminate upon expiration of a one month period from the date upon which such notice was given. Each Agreement is tailor made based on the requirements of the client and the payment that the Company receives depends on the number of the crew, the different mix of officers and ratings as well as the type and the size of the vessel.



In October 2020, we entered into an agreement with Elvictor Crew Management Ltd., which is owned by Aikaterini Galanaki, wife of Stavros Galanakis and mother of Konstantinos Galanakis, for the provision of consultancy services, to perform the running and management of the Company’s crew management contracts with third parties and provide key personnel for these services. These services include supplying crew for individual vessels, ensuring that crew has passed the required medical examinations and ensuring applicable laws are met regarding the crew members.



From October to December 2020, the Company entered into subordinated convertible notes with various investors, whereby the Company borrowed $405,725. The funds were all received in 2020 and had maturity dates three months from their respective issuance dates with no interest accruing throughout the term of the notes. The convertible notes were convertible at a fixed conversion price of $0.11 and the principal amount of the convertible notes was payable at the Company’s option in stock, by requiring the holders to convert their convertible notes into shares of the Company’s common stock, automatically at (a) the end of the three months or (b) the Company issues certain dividends in the form of common stock to existing shareholders. On February 5, 2021, the Company converted the then outstanding balance of $405,725 of convertible notes into 3,688,419 shares of common stock at $0.1103 per share. Additionally, between January 1, 2021 and January 29, 2021, the Company issued 1,016,655 shares of common stock to various investors for an aggregate proceeds of $111,833 at $0.11 per share.



On April 8, 2021, the Company received and accepted the resignation of Theofylaktos Petros Oikonomou from the role of Chief Financial Officer, and the Board also accepted the consent of a majority of the voting interests of the Company to remove Mr. Panagiotis Tolis from his position as a Director of the Company.



On April 27, 2021, the Board formally accepted the consent of a majority of the voting interests of the Company to remove Georgios Xiradakis, Theodoros Nikolopoulos, and Lampros Chachalis from their respective positions as directors of the Company pursuant to Nevada law and Section 3.5 of the Bylaws of the Company.

On November 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Software License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Seatrix Software Production Single Member S.A. (the “Licensor”), effective as of January 1, 2022, replacing a prior software license agreement entered into on April 1, 2021. Seatrix Software Production Single Member S.A. is a company owned and controlled by Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis, our Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the Licensor granted to the Company an exclusive and non-transferable license to use the Licensor’s crew management software. In consideration for this license, the Company agreed to issue to the Licensor 7,000,000 restricted shares (the “License Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”). The License Shares were issued to the Licensor on January 19, 2022.

Our Services



Crewing and Crew Management Services



Crewing is a key ship management service and refers to the selection, recruitment and training of the essential on-board crews. Crew managers source crew members for particular periods considering the specific needs on-board our clients’ vessels, the availability of crew members at the location of the vessels, and the vessels’ schedules.



We provide services that cover all the types of crew management activities. These activities include the sourcing and preliminary screening of seafarers, the matching of crew members with ship owning companies, and submission of employment proposals to them. We also direct seafarers to health clinics, record in our databases the results of their medical examinations, helping verify that the seafarers are fit and ready to perform their assignments. The company also keeps records of the travel and Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (“STCW”) documents which are required for the seafarers to board our clients’ vessels and perform services thereon. This is a highly complex procedure, given the number of seafarers handled on a daily basis, and requires us to process and store sensitive information (such as, but not limited to, the health records of the seafarers). Because of this, the Company is obligated to comply with data privacy regulations in the United States, as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the EU.



The Company briefs the seafarers on the details of their new assignment and ensures their familiarization with the tasks to be fulfilled. As soon as this step is completed, the Company makes the necessary travel arrangements, including booking of tickets, to ensure that the seafarers reach their destination port and embark the vessel safely and in a timely manner. Upon completion of the assigned trip, each seafarer undergoes a disembarkation and briefing procedure, during which seafarers may submit complaints related to previous assignments, state whether they would like to rejoin the specific ship company for further assignments, request to be promoted and/or effectively communicate any number of other issues.



For each of the aforementioned services the Company charges its clients a fee based on the salary of each seafarer, the seafarer’s rank, and the type of the vessel in which the seafarer is employed (i.e. bulker, tanker, liquefied petroleum gas tanker or container ship). Most of the Company’s revenues are recognized primarily under long-term contracts, including those for which revenues are based on either a fixed price, or cost-plus-fee basis, and primarily as performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue from crew manning and management services where the Company acts as a principle is recognized as gross revenue and when acting as an agent, revenue is recognized as net revenue in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.



Until the first quarter of 2022, we outsourced the provision of crewing and crew management services to Elvictor Crew Management Ltd. Beginning in April 2022, we intend to reduce the amount of crewing and crew management services that we outsource by providing such services directly by the Company or through our subsidiaries. The formation of our wholly owned subsidiary ELVG Crew Management Ltd in January of 2022 was done with the intent of providing such services through this subsidiary.

Ship Management Services



Ship management services include the technical and financial fleet management, the crew management and procurement process, as well as compliance with quality and safety standards:




● | The technical management includes the maintenance of the machinery and repair work of the ship to ensure the technical availability of the vessel. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Crew management is also a key ship management service and refers to the recruitment, composition and employment of the essential on-board crews. Ship managers hire crew members for particular periods considering the specific needs on-board, the availability of crew members at the location of the vessel and the vessel schedules. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial management includes finance and accounting, provision of data and performance measurement of the vessel. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company intends to expand the services it offers by also providing ship management services. In furtherance thereof, we acquired Ultra Shipmanagement from Mr. Stavros Galanakis and Mr. Konstantinos Galanakis, which has received its Det Norske Veritas AS approved Interim Document of Compliance provided under the authority granted by the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and specialized personnel has also been employed by the Company. The Interim Document of Compliance is the license required for a ship management company to start providing its services.



Competition



Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and operational resources, longer operating histories, greater marketing and advertising capabilities, and broader geographic presence than we and our subsidiaries do. Our competitors may be better positioned to outmaneuver us in the market by offering more competitive pricing and by spending significantly greater resources on advertising. Our current and potential competitors may be able to expand into markets in which we and our subsidiaries currently operate, and we and our subsidiaries are vulnerable to the marketing power and potentially significantly higher level of customer brand recognition of our larger competitors. Many of our competitors offer services that are more extensive than the services we together with our subsidiaries currently offer, and may offer such services at a price point that we may be unable to compete with.



Our competitors in ship and crew management can be separated into three broad categories:




(a) | Local manning companies focused on specific geographical markets situated in their countries of domicile (Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc.), which provide isolated services encompassing ship personnel. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | In-house ship and crew management departments of ship owning companies that usually own a substantial number of vessels. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Crew & Ship management companies providing crew management services to third parties. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that we can compete effectively with our competitors though




(i) | Our access to the biggest seafarer-supplying countries, through established relations with related or third-party companies;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Our smaller size and simpler internal structure can be more flexible to the specific requirements of each client and can offer a tailor-made approach both in the services and pricing allowing to present an attractive alternative solution to many ship owning companies; 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Our crew management platform designed to allow our personnel to collaborate with many different cultures in many different time zones with ever rising complexities, presenting a uniform service level to our clients regardless of the point of origin of the crew; and 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | Our public status that provides transparency to our operations and financial performance covering our clients ESG requirements. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As we grow our operations and venture into new products and solutions, we anticipate competitive pressures to increase, particularly from established firms that find our solutions disruptive.

Government Regulation



We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The laws and regulations govern many issues related to our business practices, including, but not limited to those regarding privacy, data security, intellectual property, taxation, wage and hour, sick pay and leaves of absence, anti-discrimination and harassment, whistleblower protections – just to name a few. We are obligated to have compliance procedures in place and to remain diligent in keeping abreast of changes in labor regulations, maritime regulations, and other trade regulations that affect our customers in order to amend our procedures. Because we are performing cash transfers to and on behalf of the crew members, we need to comply with banking regulation that applies for EU, UN and OFAC sanctions as provided to us by the banks.



The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that has been adopted by the European Union is considered in our operations and all the required consents from the crew members are provided at the local offices on behalf of the Company for processing personal data.



As we begin to roll out additional services and solutions, we may find certain aspects of our operations fall under regulatory regimes governing the specific products or the Company as a whole. For example, if we begin to provide ship management services, we may fall under certain shipping regulations.




Employees and Consultants



As of December 31, 2021, we had 10 full time employees, not including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Vice President (“VP”).
