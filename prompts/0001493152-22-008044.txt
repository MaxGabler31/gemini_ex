ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise, “Clubhouse Media,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” or “us” refer to Clubhouse Media Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries, including West of Hudson Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
 
Business Overview
 
We are an influencer-based social media firm and digital talent management agency. Our Company offers management, production and deal-making services to our handpicked influencers, a management division for individual influencer clients, and an investment arm for joint ventures and acquisitions for companies in the social media influencer space. Our management team consists of successful entrepreneurs with financial, legal, marketing, and digital content creation expertise.
 
Through our subsidiary, West of Hudson Group, Inc. (“WOHG”), we currently generate revenues primarily from (i) through Doiyen, LLC (“Doiyen”), a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG, talent management of social media influencers; (ii) through WOH Brands, LLC (“WOH Brands”), a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG, which operates Honeydrip.com, a new digital platform with a focus on the empowerment of creators. The site allows creators to connect with fans and sell exclusive photo and video content; (iii) through Digital Influence Inc. (doing business as Magiclytics), a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG (“Magiclytics”), providing predictive analytics for content creation brand deals; and (iv) for paid promotion by companies looking to utilize such social media influencers to promote their products or services. We solicit companies for potential marketing collaborations and cultivated content creation, work with the influencers and the marketing entity to negotiate and formalize a brand deal and then execute the deal and receive a certain percentage from the deal. In addition to the in-house brand deals, we generate income by providing talent management and brand partnership deals to external influencers.
 
WOHG is the 100% owner and sole member and manager of each of these entities pursuant to each of the limited liability company agreements and bylaws, where applicable, that govern these entities, and has complete and exclusive discretion in the management and control of the affairs and business of WOH Brands, Doiyen, and Magiclytics possesses all powers necessary to carry out the purposes and business of these entities. WOHG is entitled to the receipt of all income (and/or losses) that these entities generate.
 
In addition to the above, WOHG is the 100% owner of two other limited liability companies – Clubhouse Studios, LLC, which holds most of our intellectual property, and DAK Brands, LLC, each incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2020. However, each of these entities has minimal or no operations, and is not intended to have any material operations in the near future.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, Clubhouse Media generated revenues of $4,253,765 and reported a net loss of $22,245,656 and negative cash flow from operating activities of $7,970,357. As noted in the consolidated financial statements of Clubhouse Media, as of December 31, 2021, Clubhouse Media had an accumulated deficit of $24,904,074. There is substantial doubt regarding the ability of Clubhouse Media to continue as a going concern as a result of its historical recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations as well as its dependence on private equity and financings. See “Risk Factors—Clubhouse Media has a history of operating losses and its management has concluded that factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern and the auditor of Clubhouse Media has included explanatory paragraphs relating to its ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.”
 
Principal Products and Services
 
Our current principal products and services are comprised of (i) our talent management services and (ii) our brand development and content creation and (iii) Honeydrip.com.

“The Clubhouse” Online Presence 
 
“The Clubhouse” network previously consisted of physical locations. In 2021, we determined to focus exclusively on our talent management services and our brand development and content creation. Accordingly, we closed our physical Clubhouses in 2021. There are numerous “Clubhouse” accounts owned by The Clubhouse, with a following across Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and TikTok. These accounts are directly held by us (as opposed to the Clubhouse team of influencers) and therefore we have direct access to the followers of these accounts, which we consider to be our followers.
Talent Management and Digital Agency Services
 
Doiyen, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, is a talent management company and digital agency for social media influencers and generates revenues based on the earnings of its influencer-clients (or “Creators”) by receiving a percentage of the earnings of its Creators. Certain influencers enter into an Exclusive Management Agreement (each, a “Management Agreement”). Through Doiyen, we seek to represent some of the world’s top talent in the world of social media. We plan to hire experienced talent and management agents as well as build our support and administrative resources seeking to expand operations. Our influencers include entertainers, content creators, and style icons.
 
We are dedicated to helping Doiyen’s influencer-clients build their brands, maintain creative control of their destinies, and diversify and grow their businesses through “The Clubhouse,” providing them opportunities to increase their monetization potential and amplify their reach.
 

Paid Promotion
 
Doiyen and its Creators (both contracted and third party) primarily generate revenue from companies paying for promotion for their brands, products, and/or services.
 
The primary type of arrangement through which we will receive revenues from these activities through Doiyen is:
 

(i) | As a talent management company and digital agency, Doiyen generates revenues based on the earnings of its influencer-clients Creators by receiving a percentage of the earnings of its Creators. Creators are often sought after directly by companies for specific branding and/or promotional opportunities. In these situations, the client-company would contract with the Creator directly, and such services provided by the Creator would fall under the Management Agreement, and Doiyen would receive a percentage of the earnings of the Creator for such services as described above. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Companies that contract with Doiyen to provide such promotional activities for their advertising campaigns or custom content requests generally either prepay for services or request credit terms. Such agreements typically provide for either a non-refundable deposit, or a cancellation fee if the agreement is canceled by Doiyen prior to completion our promotional services.
 
Brand Development and Content Creation
 
Through WOH Brands, a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG, we engage and also plan to engage in a number of activities with respect to brand development and incubation, content creation, and technology development, as follows:

● | Content Creation: original long and short form content creation for streaming services or other platforms involved in content distribution; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Brand Development and Product Sales: acquiring or creating in-house brands and selling products in various categories, including apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle brands; and 
● | Technology: Through Magiclytics, we provide predictive analytics for content creation brand deals. In September 2021, the Company launched its subscription-based site HoneyDrip.com, a new digital platform designed and owned by Clubhouse Media Group with a focus on the empowerment of creators. The site allows creators to connect with fans and sell exclusive photo and video content

Brand Development
 
On May 19, 2020, WOH Brands began to engage in brand development, with a focus on creating apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle brands with quality product offerings. Through WOH Brands, our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, we intend to acquire, enter into joint ventures or launch best-in-class brands with an objective of innovation and product uniqueness, derived from demographic data, market research, and omni-channel experiences.
 
WOH Brands is primarily focused on creating brands on our behalf and may consider joint-ventures with other established companies in the consumer-packaged goods space for purposes of brand and production creation. WOH Brands will not provide its branding or product services to third parties outside of the Clubhouse Media-family of companies other than companies with which it may enter into a joint venture or other companies it contracts with to do so.
 
As of the date of this Prospectus, WOH Brands has only sold a minimal amount of products, and has only generated minimal revenues.
 
Content Creation
 
WOH Brands acts as an internal studio for us, with the ability to develop ideas for, produce, and film content.
 
Magiclytics provides predictive analytics for content creation brand deals.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, WOH Brands’ activities in this area have been limited to assisting in the production of paid-promotional content for companies that have engaged Doiyen or Doiyen’s Creators for brand and product promotion, as well as content-creation for Clubhouse, for which WOH Brands does not receive compensation. WOH Brands’ activities in this capacity include filming, photography, and graphic design.
Planned Operations
 

● | Brand Development. As stated above, WOH Brands intends to acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or create new brands in apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle categories in the future. We believe that we are in a unique position to gather data intelligence from our dealings with paid brand deals. While companies pay Doiyen and our influencers to promote their products or services, we gain firsthand insight into what type of brands (and their corresponding products and services) resonate with our demographic. We believe that this information better positions WOH Brands in deciding what type of product or service to acquire or build. WOH Brands will not provide its brand development services to third parties outside of the Clubhouse Media-family of companies, but may engage in joint ventures with third parties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Content Creation. In the future, WOH Brands intends to create entertainment content for streaming services and other platforms in the entertainment and/or social media space. WOH Brands expects it could receive ad revenues, revenues for licensing, and/or revenues for sales of content to purchasers in this space. 
● | Technology Development / Software. WOH Brands also intends to continue to develop its Magiclytics software, which provides predictive ROI on influencer campaigns. 
● | Subscription Services. In September 2021, the Company launched its subscription-based site HoneyDrip.com, a new digital platform designed and owned by Clubhouse Media Group with a focus on the empowerment of creators. The site allows creators to connect with fans and sell exclusive photo and video content. We plan to continue to expand the number of users and creators on the site.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
Social Media and Influencer Marketing and Promotion
 
Around the world, marketing is a key strategy for brands to obtain exposure, achieve better recall, communicate themes and drive increased consumer engagement. Globally, in 2018, there was an estimated spend of $66 billion on sponsorships, up from $43 billion in 2008, according to Statista 2019-Worldwide; IEG; 2007 to 2017. As for the overall advertising landscape, Zenith estimated that global advertising spending will reach $705 billion in 2021, up from $634 billion in 2019, and will rise to $873 billion by 2024.
 
Advertising has shifted significantly towards social media over the last few years, and social media influencers who are the primary form of advertisement distribution is highly disorganized. We believe that one of the most important aspects of building a company or launching a product is social media marketing. According to Sprout Social, as of January 2022, there are 3.96 billion total social media users across all platforms. This makes social media marketing a great tool for any company.
 
According to a Business Insider Intelligence report titled “Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2021” originally published in December 2019 and updated February 2021, influencer marketing spending has grown significantly since 2015 and is expected to reach $13.8 billion annually by 2021. According to the same source, currently 78% of companies spend over 10% of their marketing budget on influencer marketing and 11% of companies allocate more than 40% of their marketing budget on influencer marketing and the percentage is expected to grow as more companies become comfortable with the channel. Also according to the same source, companies surveyed about influencer marketing noted that content quality, aligned target audience demographic and engagement rate were the three most important determinants in choosing influencer partners and that the two most important goals for influencer marketing based on survey responses were increasing brand awareness and reaching new audiences in order to expand their existing customer base. Furthermore, according to Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing spend is projected to reach $16.4 billion in 2022.
 
We intend to capitalize on this growing social media and influencer based advertising spending, utilizing our Clubhouse influencers to attract advertisers directly, as well as generating business for Creators, for which we will receive compensation pursuant to our Management Agreements.
 
Competition
 
As a talent management company through Doiyen, we compete against other talent management companies that are specific to the social media influencer space, such as IZEA and Viral Nation. We compete with these other companies on the basis of our brand name, reputation for access to industry participants and desirable projects, as well as pricing.
 
For our brands and products, we currently compete primarily with other specialty retailers, higher-end department stores and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of women’s and men’s apparel, accessories and similar merchandise targeting customers aged 12 to 30. We believe the principal basis upon which we compete are design, quality, and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantage is high visibility, which we can achieve through our network of Clubhouse influencers.

For our platform Honeydrip.com, we directly compete with OnlyFans, an industry leader. HoneyDrip differentiates itself from OnlyFans by being an Invite only site, our site is female empowering, and we offer an inhouse account management services for creators.
 
In the future, we expect to compete with other content-creators for placement on streaming services and other content platforms, with technology and software companies in the social media space, and with companies making lifestyle and/or beauty products marketed to social media audiences.
 
We seek to effectively compete with such competitors by out-scaling our competition, focusing on in-house business infrastructure and providing superior support and management services for our Clubhouse influencers. We strive to have more physical locations than other influencer-house networks. Currently, we are unaware of any other company that is combining into one business the various business aspects in which we engage. In addition, we believe the experience of our management team provides us with a significant advantage in the social media influencer business, as participants in this space have traditionally lacked the business experience that our executive management team possesses, which we intend to use to our advantage. Notwithstanding, we may not be able to effectively compete with such competitors.
 
Customers
 
Our customers include our influencer-clients, or Creators (through Doiyen), companies that contract directly with us (through Doiyen) for paid promotion, and the consumers that purchase our products (through WOH Brands).
 
Doiyen and its Creators have already worked with a number of notable brands, including, but not limited to, Fashion Nova, Spotify, McDonalds, Amazon, and Boohoo.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We generally attract clients through our social media presence across various platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.
 
As a respected name in the social media influencer industry, we are often approached by influencers who want us to represent them (through DoiyenWe also scout for up-and-coming talented influencers on various social media platforms, who we then attempt to engage as clients.
 
For paid promotion, we generally receive inbound inquiries for promotional opportunities from companies looking to promote their brands or products. Doiyen also has a sales team to reach out to specific brands that we believe fits a specific influencer’s style, which is another way we generate business.
 
All products that we sell are marketed through our Clubhouse team of influencers, who provide promotion and marketing social media posts on our behalf.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, governing matters such as:
 

● | licensing laws for talent management companies, such as California’s Talent Agencies Act;

Organizational History

On December 27, 2006, Tongji, Inc. acquired 100% of the equity of NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we issued 15,652,557 shares of common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NTH. The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of NTH obtained control of the entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a recapitalization of NTH, with NTH being treated as the continuing operating entity. The Company, through NTH, thereafter operated the hospital, until the Company eventually sold NTH, as described below.

Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from the Magiclytics Shareholders, who hold an aggregate of 5,000 shares of Magiclytics’ common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Magiclytics Shares”), all 5,000 Magiclytics Shares, representing 100% of Magiclytics’ issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance by the Company to the Magiclytics Shareholders of the 734,689 shares of the Company’s common stock based on a $3,500,000 valuation of Magiclytics, to be apportioned between the Magiclytics Shareholders pro rata based on their respective ownership of Magiclytics Shares.
 
On February 3, 2021 (the “Magiclytics Closing Date”), the parties closed on the transactions contemplated in the A&R Share Exchange Agreement, and the Company agreed to issue 734,689 shares of Company common stock to the Magiclytics Shareholders in exchange for all 5,000 Magiclytics Shares (the “Magiclytics Closing”). On February 3, 2021, pursuant to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired Magiclytics, and Magiclytics thereafter became our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
At the Magiclytics Closing, we agreed to issue to Christian Young and Wilfred Man each 330,610 shares of Company Common Stock, representing 45% each, or 90% in total of the Company common stock which we agreed to issue to the Magiclytics Shareholders at the Magiclytics Closing. As of February 7, 2021, we have not issued the 734,689 shares to the Magiclytics shareholders.
 
The number of shares of the Company common stock issued at the Magiclytics Closing was based on the fair market value of the Company common stock as initially agreed to by the parties, which is $4.76 per share (the “Base Value”). The fair market value was determined based on the volume weighted average closing price of the Company common stock for the twenty (20) trading day period immediately prior to the Magiclytics,. In the event that the initial public offering price per share of the Company common stock in this offering pursuant to Regulation A is less than the Base Value, then within three (3) business days of the qualification by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) of the Offering Statement forming part of this Prospectus, the Company will issue to the Magiclytics Shareholders a number of additional shares of Company common stock equal to:
 

1. | $3,500,000 divided by the initial public offering price per share of the Company common stock in this offering pursuant to Regulation A, minus 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | 734,689. 

 
The resulting number of shares of the Company common stock pursuant to the above calculation will be referred to as the “Additional Shares”, and such Additional Shares will also be issued to the Magiclytics Shareholders pro rata based on their respective ownership of Magiclytics Shares. The Company issued additional 140,311 shares in November 2021 based on the offering price of $4 in the Regulation A offering.
 
In addition to the exchange of shares between the Magiclytics Shareholders and the Company described above, on the Magiclytics Closing Date the parties took a number of other actions in connection with the Magiclytics Closing pursuant to the terms of the A&R Share Exchange Agreement:
 

(i) | The Board of Directors of Magiclytics (the “Magiclytics Board”) expanded the size of the Magiclytics Board to 3 persons and named Simon Yu, a current officer and director of the Company as a director of the Magiclytics Board. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | The Magiclytics Board named Wilfred Man as the Chief Executive Officer of Magiclytics, Christian Young as the President and Secretary of the Magiclytics and Simon Yu as the Chief Operating Officer of Magiclytics.
