Item 1. | Business

We are a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, succeed online. We serve approximately 4.8 million subscribers globally with a range of products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses. In addition to for-profit businesses, our subscribers include non-profit organizations, community groups, bloggers, and hobbyists. Although we provide our solutions through a number of brands, we are focusing our marketing, engineering and product development efforts on a small number of strategic assets, including our Constant Contact, Bluehost, HostGator, and Domain.com brands. 
For financial reporting purposes, we currently report our business results in three reportable segments, as follows: 
Web Presence. Our web presence segment consists primarily of our web hosting brands, the largest of which are Bluehost and HostGator. This segment also includes related products such as domain names, website security, website design tools and services, and e-commerce products. 
Domain. Our domain segment consists of domain-focused brands such as Domain.com, ResellerClub and LogicBoxes as well as certain web hosting brands that are under common management with our domain-focused brands. This segment sells domain names and domain management services to resellers and end users, as well as premium domain names, and also generates advertising revenue from domain name parking. It also resells domain names and domain management services to our web presence segment. 
Email Marketing. Our email marketing segment consists of Constant Contact email marketing tools and related products and our SinglePlatform digital storefront solution.
You can find more information about our reportable segments in Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our Market, Products and Services 
SMBs represent a large and diverse market, both in the United States and internationally. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there were approximately 30.2 million small businesses in the United States in 2015. Of these small businesses, approximately 24.3 million were non-employer firms, or companies that do not have paid employees. In addition, a 2010 study by the International Finance Corporation and McKinsey & Company estimates that there are more than 420 million micro, small and medium enterprises (defined as one to 250 employees) worldwide. 
Many SMBs have limited technological and marketing expertise, time and financial resources. However, we believe SMBs understand that the Internet and the proliferation of mobile devices are changing the way consumers discover and transact with businesses, making an effective online presence critical. 
Our offerings, which consist of both proprietary applications and third-party products, can be broadly grouped as follows: products that get SMBs online by providing an easy and cost-effective way to create an online presence; marketing solutions that help SMBs get found by increasing their online visibility and building customer loyalty; and services and applications such as dedicated processing power, collaboration tools and secure online payment services that help SMBs grow their business. 
Getting SMBs Online: 
Web Hosting and Builders. By providing a set of core products that combine storage, bandwidth and processing power, our entry-level shared hosting services enable subscribers to create an initial web presence quickly and cost-effectively. Our website building tools enable subscribers with varying degrees of technical sophistication to create a customized web presence. We also offer various premium elements that subscribers can purchase separately to enhance their website and provide a more engaging user experience for their customers, including mobile optimization, social networking features, customer interaction tools, embedded videos, photo galleries, blogs, maps, polls and community forums. 
Domain Registration, Management and Resale. As an accredited domain registrar with approximately 11.9 million domains under management at December 31, 2018, we enable our subscribers to search and purchase available domain names from a wide spectrum of domain registries. We also maintain a portfolio of premium domains that are available for resale.

Security. We offer malware protection solutions to help protect our subscribers’ websites from viruses, malicious code and other threats. Our offerings, including a web application firewall, can help prevent attacks on subscriber websites before they affect subscriber data or operations. For subscribers that collect personally identifiable information or other private data from their customers and website visitors, we offer Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, certificates that encrypt data collected on a subscriber’s website.
Site Back-Up. We offer backup control solutions that enable subscribers to schedule, maintain, manage and restore backups of their online data and websites. 
Getting SMBs Found:
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM). We offer a variety of search engine optimization and marketing solutions that can improve a subscriber’s ability to be discovered by potential customers. These services help a subscriber distribute its business profile to online directories and manage links and keywords with on-page diagnostic tools. We also offer pay-per-click (PPC) services designed to direct traffic to a subscriber’s website. 
Mobile. We offer solutions that allow our subscribers to have their websites rendered on mobile devices and target mobile customers for their businesses, among other features and functionality. Our website builder solutions offer mobile-ready templates, which enable small businesses to ensure that their websites render well on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Social Media. We offer tools and services that enable our subscribers to communicate effectively with their customers and potential customers through social networks. 
Analytics. We offer control panels and dashboards that provide our subscribers with tools to analyze activity on their websites. 
Helping SMBs Grow: 
Email Marketing. Our email marketing solution allows small businesses and other organizations to easily create, send and track professional-looking email campaigns, allowing them to communicate effectively with their customers and potential customers via email. Email marketing services available to subscribers include building and segmenting mailing lists, designing and managing email newsletters, coupons, scheduling and sending email messages, and reporting and tracking the results of each campaign. We offer our email marketing solution on a stand-alone basis through our Constant Contact brand, and through bundled offerings that combine email marketing with other marketing offerings, including managing events online, conducting surveys and getting feedback, and marketing automation capabilities. 
Advanced Web Hosting. In addition to providing shared hosting services, we also provide virtual private server, or VPS, hosting and dedicated hosting solutions. As a subscriber’s business expands and the demands on its website increase, these more customizable and higher performance solutions allow our subscribers to build additional functionality into their websites, offer high bandwidth content and drive more commerce and marketing activities while reducing load times and increasing site speeds. Subscribers can start with an advanced web hosting solution or upgrade from an existing shared hosting service.
Productivity Solutions. We offer our subscribers email capabilities, including custom mailboxes that reflect a subscriber’s domain name, spam filters, email aliases and forwarding functionality. Our communications tools also allow a subscriber to unify its email inbox with other communications streams, such as social media feeds. We also offer our customers email, collaboration, and file sharing tools. 
E-commerce Enablement. As our subscribers grow their businesses and their need for e-commerce tools increases, we offer products that enable secure and encrypted payments, shopping carts, payment processing and related services and mobile payments.
Professional Services. We offer professional services and web design for subscribers who want a professionally created web presence. 
SinglePlatform. Our SinglePlatform solution provides local businesses the ability to create and manage digital storefront listings and extend their online reach through one interface. The digital storefront, which may include menus, photos, services, offers and featured products, is distributed online across over 100 online publishers, including numerous websites, social networks, directories, and mobile applications such as Yelp, Google, Facebook, Foursquare, TripAdvisor and others.

Sales & Marketing
Although we operate through numerous brands, we are focusing our marketing expenditures on our strategic brands, which include Constant Contact, Bluehost, HostGator and Domain.com.
For our web presence segment, the majority of our program marketing expense has historically been associated with targeted online search marketing, including for inclusion of our brands in online directories, and with payments to our large network of referral partners, who drive subscribers to us on a paid referral basis. Payments to our referral partners primarily occur after a subscriber signs up on our platform and therefore allow us to readily determine the returns on our marketing spend. We also attract new subscribers through word-of-mouth referrals and through partnerships that help us reach additional subscribers, such as our partnerships with Google and WordPress. 
For our domain segment, we use a combination of online search marketing and a network of referral partners, as well as joint marketing efforts with registries of various generic top level domain names, such as ".com", aimed at increasing subscribers.
For our email marketing segment, we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources, including online marketing, such as search engines and advertising with online networks and other websites, offline marketing through television and radio advertising, partner relationships, outbound sales efforts, referrals from our customer base, general brand awareness and a link to our website in the footer of substantially all of the emails sent by our customers. We have partner relationships with over 10,000 local and national small business service providers. These partners refer customers to us through links on their websites and outbound promotions to their customers or allow us to market to their customers directly. Our television and radio advertising is designed to educate potential customers about our email marketing solutions and raise awareness of our brand. 
Subscriber Support 
Our support agents assist our subscribers via phone, email, chat and social media. Our support personnel not only assist subscribers with technical issues, but also focus on understanding the business goals of each subscriber to help identify the right products and services to achieve those goals. Our primary support centers are located in Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Brazil and India. In addition, we have third-party support arrangements in India, the Philippines and China. 
Technology Platform and Infrastructure
Web Presence and Domain Segments
The technology platforms supporting our web presence and domain segments combine open source and proprietary software, and are based on a scalable architecture that allows us to operate with a large number of subscribers per server. In addition, we use subscriber relationship management, billing and subscriber service support systems to on-board, serve and track our subscribers, and to enable them to manage their own service experience. We currently serve most of our web presence and domain subscribers from five U.S.-based data centers, one of which is owned by us and the rest of which are co-located. 
Email Marketing Segment
For our email marketing segment, we use a central application and a single software code base with unique accounts for each subscriber, except for SinglePlatform, which operates on a separate code base. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of providing our products across our email marketing customer base. In addition, because we have one central application, we believe we are able to scale our business to meet increases in demand for our products. We own all of the hardware deployed in support of our platform, except for SinglePlatform, which operates on a third party’s infrastructure. Our production system hardware and the disaster recovery hardware for our production system, with the exception of SinglePlatform, are co-located in third-party hosting facilities in Massachusetts and Texas.
Subscriber Profile 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4.8 million subscribers, of which approximately 3.6 million were web presence subscribers, 0.7 million were domain segment subscribers and 0.5 million were email marketing segment subscribers. Based on data from a 2015 survey of subscribers of our major web presence brands, we believe a majority of our web presence subscribers are SMBs, most of whom are businesses with five or fewer employees. We estimate that approximately 80% of subscribers of our email marketing segment employ 25 or fewer employees. 
The industries in which our subscribers operate are very diverse, including retail, restaurants, professional services, non-profits, merchandising, media, recreation, education, construction, health, beauty and wellness, and arts and entertainment,

among others. In addition to for-profit businesses, our subscribers include non-profit organizations, community groups, bloggers, and hobbyists.
Geographical Information 
We currently maintain offices and conduct operations primarily in the United States, Brazil, India, and the Netherlands. We also have third-party support arrangements in India, the Philippines and China. For additional information about our geographic areas, please see Note 22 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Competition 
The global cloud-based services market for SMBs is highly competitive and constantly evolving. For our web presence and domain segments, we expect continued competition, both domestically and internationally, from a number of sources, including competitors in the domain, hosting and website builder markets such as GoDaddy, 1 and 1, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, Web.com, and Wordpress.com, as well as large companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which offer web hosting or website builders, domain registration and other cloud-based services, and Facebook, which offers an Internet marketing platform. For our email marketing segment, we expect continued competition from MailChimp and other SMB-focused lower-cost email marketing vendors, as well as additional competition from providers of marketing automation software and larger companies such as Microsoft. In some instances, we have commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the cloud-based services market for SMBs include: ease of use and effectiveness; product functionality, performance and reliability; customer service and support; availability of a range of integrated solutions; brand awareness and reputation; affordability; and product scalability. See "Risk Factors" for additional discussion of competition as it pertains to our business.
Seasonality 
Our web presence and domain segments have historically experienced moderately increased subscriber billings in the first quarter of our fiscal year as many subscribers start businesses at the beginning of a new year. These segments record a significant portion of these billings as deferred revenue and recognize the deferred revenue throughout the course of the year and beyond based on the term of the applicable subscription. This slight seasonality has a favorable impact on our operating cash flows in the early part of each fiscal year, and an unfavorable impact in the latter part of each fiscal year. We expect that this seasonality will continue.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property. 
We use open source technologies pursuant to applicable licenses as the basis for our technology platform. We have also developed, acquired or licensed proprietary technologies for use in our business. As of January 14, 2019, we have seventeen U.S. patents as well as two pending U.S. patent applications and several pending foreign counterpart applications relating to aspects of our technology platform and offerings, including our shared services architecture, predictive analytics methods, virtualization technologies, subscriber migration technologies, web presence improvement technologies, and email composition and editing technologies. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of the technologies they cover. 
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established through years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours. 
We have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, subscribers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information; however, unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or proprietary technologies by our employees or third parties could still occur. In addition, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary rights. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we expand outside of the United States. 
5

Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap across industries. Third parties, including non-practicing patent holders, have claimed, and could claim in the future, that our processes, technologies or websites infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or that might be issued in the future. See “Risk Factors" for additional discussion about the substantial costs that we could incur as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property rights.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,901 employees, including 2,239 in support and network operations, 704 in sales and marketing, 639 in engineering and development, and 319 in general and administrative. Excluded from our employee figures are approximately 1,540 individuals primarily located in India and the Philippines who are directly employed by third parties and perform a range of services for us, including email- and chat-based customer and technical support, billing support, network monitoring and engineering and development services. Most of our employees are based in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Corporate Information
Our business was founded in 1997 as a Delaware corporation under the name Innovative Marketing Technologies Incorporated. In December 2011, investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman, Sachs & Co. acquired a controlling interest in our company. Prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2013, we were an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WP Expedition Topco L.P., a Delaware limited partnership that we refer to as WP Expedition Topco. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that we completed prior to our IPO, WP Expedition Topco dissolved and in liquidation distributed the shares of common stock of Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. to its partners in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of WP Expedition Topco. We have completed numerous acquisitions since inception, including the acquisition of Constant Contact, Inc. in February 2016.
