 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions and services throughout the United States, Australia, Europe and Canada. We provide integrated technology solutions and services which include toll and violations management, title and registration, automated safety solutions, parking enforcement and citation and other data driven solutions to our customers, which include rental car companies (“RACs”), fleet management companies (“FMCs”), other large fleet owners, municipalities, school districts, universities, parking operators, healthcare facilities, transportation hubs and other violation-issuing authorities. Our solutions simplify the smart mobility ecosystem by utilizing what we believe are industry-leading capabilities, information and technology expertise, and integrated hardware and software to efficiently facilitate the automated processing of tolls and violations, automated safety, and parking solutions for hundreds of agencies and millions of end users annually, while also making cities and roadways safer for everyone.
 Based in Mesa, Arizona, we operate through three primary segments – Commercial Services, Government Solutions and Parking Solutions. Through our Commercial Services segment, we believe we are the market-leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in the United States and Canada. In Europe, we provide violations processing through Euro Parking Collection plc (“EPC”) and consumer tolling services through Pagatelia S.L (“Pagatelia”). Through our Government Solutions segment, we believe we are the market-leading provider of automated safety solutions to municipalities, counties, school districts and law enforcement agencies (which are collectively referred to herein as “local government agencies”), including services and technology that enable photo enforcement via road safety camera programs related to red-light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes. Through our Parking Solutions segment, we provide end-to-end parking management solutions to universities, parking operators, healthcare facilities and municipalities in North America.
 Segments
Commercial Services

Our Commercial Services segment generated approximately $260.9 million in revenue for 2021, or approximately 47.4% of our total revenue. The Commercial Services segment is the market-leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in North America and Europe. Through our established relationships with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States, we provide an automated and outsourced administrative solution for our customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers and benefits to the tolling and issuing authorities. Without our toll and violations management solutions, our customers would bear the expense and administrative burden of matching tolls or violations to the responsible vehicle and driver, and then either transferring liability or paying the fee or fine directly (for which it may then need to bill the driver) – in either case within specified time periods to avoid the potential imposition of penalties. We mitigate these risks by ensuring timely payment for tolls and violations incurred by our customers’ vehicles or by performing timely transfers of liability on our customers’ behalf, and then billing and collecting from the driver as applicable. We also manage regional toll transponder installation and vehicle association, an especially critical and highly complex component for RAC and FMC customers, to ensure that the transponder (and corresponding toll transactions) are associated with the correct vehicle.
 
We have long-standing relationships with the three largest RACs in the United States, Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, Inc. and The Hertz Corporation, among others. We also have relationships with key European RACs and the six largest FMCs in the United States, which are Element, ARI, Enterprise Fleet Management, Wheels, LeasePlan and Donlen. We provide coverage for more than 95% of all toll roads in the United States, one toll road in Canada, and multiple toll roads in France, Ireland and Spain, processing more than 224 million toll transactions and 1.4 million traffic violations in 2021. In Europe, our customer base includes violation-issuing authorities and we offer services including identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking, and public transportation-related violations incurred by drivers not originating in the country where the violation occurred.

Government Solutions
Our Government Solutions segment generated approximately $283.2 million in revenue for 2021, or approximately 51.4% of our total revenue. This segment works with local government agencies to help make cities and roadways safer for everyone through automated safety solutions. In the United States, we provide local government agencies with road safety cameras to detect and process traffic violations for red-light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes. Our proprietary hardware and software technologies provide local government agencies the information, data, and automated end-to-end administrative capabilities to enforce traffic violations through photo enforcement. On behalf of our customers, we install, maintain, and manage automated safety solution hardware and software that processes event data, applies customer specific rules and connects a traffic violation to the responsible driver or vehicle owner. Additionally, upon law enforcement’s determination that a violation has occurred, we manage the citation mailing, billing, and other administrative tasks on behalf of many of our customers. For customers outside of the United States, we design, engineer, and maintain roadside photo enforcement technology, which is sold to local municipalities and maintained with maintenance contracts to support the technology.
 We are a critical partner to local government agencies around the world, helping to facilitate and increase public safety, improve public transportation, enhance law enforcement officer safety and act as a police force multiplier by allowing law enforcement to focus on serious crimes rather than routine traffic violations. In North America, we currently have more than 9,000 red-light, speed, school bus and city bus lane road safety cameras installed across approximately 265 jurisdictions and school districts in 23 states, the District of Columbia and four provinces. On an annual basis, we process approximately 13.8 million violations on behalf of our municipality and school district customers, including New York City, Nassau County (New York), Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, Orange County (Florida) and Seattle. Outside of the United States, we have partnered with 15 agencies, including state governments and police departments, to provide photo enforcement programs. Our current combined international client base includes over 1,300 systems, with products including red light, fixed speed, mobile speed, point-to-point speed, railroad crossing, bus lane enforcement and weigh-in-motion solutions. In June 2021, we completed our acquisition of Redflex Holdings Limited (“Redflex”), which expanded our presence in North America, Europe and Australia.
Parking Solutions
 
We formed our Parking Solutions business unit after our acquisition of T2 Systems Parent Corporation (“T2 Systems”) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Parking Solutions segment generated $6.5 million in revenue for the post-acquisition period of December 7 to December 31, 2021. Our Parking Solutions segment is a North American leader of end-to-end commercial parking management solutions in the markets we serve. This segment serves over 2,000 customers in the university, municipal, healthcare and commercial operator markets. Our proprietary software and hardware technologies provides our customers with solutions needed to manage and monetize parking and enforcement operations. In 2021, we processed over 115,000 transactions using our various parking solutions systems. Each need requires technology solutions for parking access and revenue control, single- and multi-space pay stations, integrated physical and mobile payments, back-office parking rate management, permit issuance and management, online citation payment, event parking, occupancy, and back-office management of violations, amongst other requirements.
 
The Parking Solutions segment has over 2,000 customers throughout the United States and Canada. Customers include top-tier university customers, such as Arizona State University and Texas A&M University, as well as major municipalities and commercial parking operators, such as City of Houston, EasyPark Vancouver, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Reef Technologies, SP+ and Diamond Parking. In December 2021, we completed an acquisition of NuPark (“NuPark”) which expanded our presence in the United States.
 The Industries in Which We Operate
Tolling
Tolling is an important feature of the United States transportation landscape, with United States tolling authorities collecting over $20 billion in toll revenues in 2020. As a result, tolling is one of the most effective and equitable ways to pay for highway infrastructure. In addition to the overall growth in tolling reflected in the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration’s tracking of total toll bridge, tunnel and road mileage, there is also a growing movement towards cashless and all-electronic tolling, which allows for more

convenient, accurate and reliable processing and collection of toll incurrence fees and mitigates congestion on toll roads. The tolling industry is highly fragmented and complex as it is comprised of more than 50 individual tolling authorities, each operating as independent organizations with specific coverage regions and disparate technology platforms.
Commercial Fleet
Our Commercial Services customers consist of RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners. RAC industry revenue in the United States are estimated to have grown 21% in 2021 compared to 2020, due to a partial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The approximately $28 billion United States RAC industry is highly consolidated, with three companies accounting for a significant majority of United States RAC revenues in 2021. In addition to the larger nationwide RACs, smaller independent companies operate regionally throughout the United States. While the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected RAC industry trends in fiscal 2020, the length of rentals returned to previous seasonality patterns beginning in the second half of 2020 and the RAC industry was positively impacted by increases in the average number of days vehicles were rented in 2021. The industry is also being impacted by the growth in usage cases for rental cars in urban areas and partnerships with rideshare providers to rent vehicles to their independent drivers, leading to additional rental transactions. The fleet industry in North America is primarily centered on vocational vehicles utilized for transporting people along with the tools, parts and equipment required to perform their jobs, largely insulating the industry from disruptions caused by today’s rideshare and carshare services. Management believes the European RAC market, while more fragmented than the U.S. market, is large in size.
Automated Safety
As the number of vehicle miles traveled continues to increase and cities and municipalities wrestle with the evolving challenges of managing traffic congestion, road safety and accessible transportation networks, automated enforcement solutions continue to serve as an effective tool for comprehensive safety and mobility initiatives. According to United States Department of Transportation statistics, almost 95% of people who die using U.S. transportation networks are killed on our streets, roads and highways, resulting in more than 350,000 deaths between 2011 and 2020. In 2020, the Congressional Research Service found cameras to be an effective tool for law enforcement and other agencies to reduce the number of traffic-related violations, collisions, injuries and fatalities, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials has called on states to support greater use of automated speed enforcement. New York City’s Automated Speed Enforcement Program 2014-2020 Report, noted a 72% average reduction in dangerous speeding at its fixed camera locations. Additionally, programs like Vision Zero, a collaborative campaign helping communities reach their goals of eliminating all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, across most major U.S. cities and around the world, are driving capital investment to make meaningful strides in traffic safety.
Parking
 The parking industry consists of a highly fragmented mix of end customers, including universities, municipalities, private operators, healthcare providers and airports, among other industries. These customers each have different parking needs such as off-street parking, on-street parking, permits, enforcement and consumer engagement. T2 Systems has customer relationships with more than 21% of higher education institutions in its target tiers, and about 5% of municipal customers in its target tiers according to internal analysis. The broader parking market in which T2 System’s operates – North American municipalities, universities and healthcare providers – represents up to a $4 billion market according to a 2020 market estimate.
 Growth Strategies
Benefit from Strong Industry Tailwinds
We believe there is significant opportunity in Commercial Services, Government Solutions and Parking Solutions as states, counties, municipalities, universities, parking operators, healthcare facilities and transportation hubs seek creative solutions to address safety initiatives, reduced tax revenues and budgets for roads and other transportation infrastructure.
 In Commercial Services, we believe that as state and local governments fund a growing list of infrastructure, maintenance and construction projects, there will be an increase in the number of toll roads, including new express

and high occupancy lanes in urban areas. We expect this trend will also increase utilization of dynamic tolling, which allows toll rates to fluctuate based on traffic trends and real-time congestion. In addition, over 60% of the toll roads in the United States have transitioned to cashless or all-electronic payment. These trends create significant opportunities for us to expand our market presence while developing relationships with both new and existing RACs, FMCs, consumers and tolling authorities.
In Government Solutions, public attention given to traffic safety issues for drivers, pedestrians, children, bicyclists and law enforcement is intensifying and state and local governments are facing shortfalls in transportation revenue. In this context, smart technology solutions have emerged as an effective and revenue-positive method to address traffic safety issues. We believe that as public focus intensifies, the demand for our Government Solutions offerings will grow as well, and that we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
In Parking Solutions, all market segments are focused on strategies to offset costs in reaction to downturns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and market participants are struggling to attract and retain labor. At the same time, consumers are increasingly willing to adopt mobile solutions to simplify their transportation needs, creating market opportunities to advance self-service options. We believe that technology solutions that provide mobile-first, self-service offerings, improve operational efficiency, reduce reliance on parking-related labor, and commercial models that reduce up-front costs provide solutions for market needs and establish a long-term operating model.
 Expand Platform with New Products and New and Growing End Markets
We are an industry leader in the deployment of products and services that meet the increasingly complex and continuously evolving requirements of both existing and new customers. We are continuously looking toward the future, ensuring the development of relevant solutions today that will work tomorrow. We seek to understand developing customer, consumer, and government trends that will shape tomorrow’s smart mobility experiences both in the United States and internationally, all in an effort to ensure more people around the world reach their destination safely and efficiently.

We believe leveraging our differentiated capabilities into new and growing end markets, such as ridesharing, carsharing and autonomous vehicles, provides attractive growth opportunities. The ridesharing and carsharing market, which includes vehicles leased to individual drivers, gives us a low-risk opportunity to grow Commercial Services revenues while at the same time insulating us from any market shift between ridesharing, carsharing and RACs. Further, this growth prospect comes at little additional investment as we are able to leverage the same technologies and solutions we have already developed for our RAC and FMC customers. As an already established leader, we believe we are well-positioned to be a first mover and to become a provider of choice in these new end markets.
Urban enforcement, curb management and citation processing solutions in the smart city movement also present significant opportunities for us. Our existing technologies and solutions could be adapted to take advantage of this market, providing an additional avenue for growth.
As state and local governments seek solutions to increase mobility and safety solutions in a challenging revenue environment, our Government Solutions business unit represents an opportunity to leverage our long-standing relationships with state and local governments in order to provide other smart mobility technology solutions, such as automatic license plate recognition, parking payment and enforcement, and new developing urban mobility technologies.
 Expand Global Footprint
We believe there is significant opportunity to expand into attractive markets across Europe and beyond, and to that end, we have established our European headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from which we have launched our RAC and FMC tolling solution business in Europe. Our European tolling business has established relationships with tolling authorities throughout Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Ireland, through which we offer interoperable electronic tolling directly to consumers, through white-label partnerships and to RAC customers, depending on location. We also gained certification as a European Electronic Toll Service (“EETS”) provider in Spain in June 2021. EETS regulation applies to all European Union member states with current or future toll infrastructure development plans. Additionally, our European violations business can provide services in more than 20 languages and more than 10 currencies and to leverage existing connections with approximately 30 vehicle licensing authorities and over 600 toll and ticket-issuing authorities for whom we bill violators in more than 135

countries. Furthermore, in June 2021, we closed an agreement to acquire Redflex, which expanded our Government Solutions business into Australia and Europe, and enhances our existing presence in the United States and Canada.
 Pursue Accretive Acquisitions
In addition to organic growth initiatives, we have significant opportunities to increase our competitive positioning and strengthen our portfolio of products and solutions through strategic acquisitions. We have demonstrated the ability to identify and execute strategic acquisitions, as we did with Redflex and T2 Systems in 2021. We constantly monitor the market for potential acquisition targets, which are evaluated based on their potential strategic impact, including growth potential, synergies, end-market development, customer relationships, technology, and cash flow. Our management team has a strong record of pursing accretive acquisitions, and, where applicable, integrating acquisitions and driving synergies, and has identified a strong pipeline for future acquisitions.
Products
Commercial Services
Toll management solutions
 We provide fully outsourced toll management solutions for our RAC and FMC customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers via our established relationships and integrations with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States. This comprehensive network allows RAC and FMC drivers the convenience of using cashless and all-electronic tolls. Additionally, this service helps prevent the liability and business disruption of costly toll violations incurred by vehicles owned by RAC and FMC customers and eliminates their need to manage a nationwide program internally. Our proprietary software technology and hardware allow us to effectively match a toll to the specific RAC or FMC vehicle and driver so that the toll can accurately and reliably be billed and collected on behalf of, or directly from, the RAC or FMC. Toll management solutions accounted for approximately 40% of our 2021 revenues.
Violations management solutions
 Our violations management solutions process violations incurred by the drivers of RAC and FMC vehicles by working with more than 8,000 domestic violation-issuing authorities (more than 400 of which we are directly integrated with) to either pay the fine on behalf of the vehicle owner (for which we are able to bill the driver) or to transfer liability directly to the vehicle driver. Vehicle-issued violations include parking and photo enforcement violations. In Europe, we specialize in the identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking and public transport related fees, charges, and penalties issued to foreign registered vehicles or persons on behalf of issuing authorities in more than 17 European countries. Violation management solutions accounted for approximately 5% of our 2021 revenues.
Title and registration solutions
 Our title and registration solutions provide RAC and FMC customers with an integrated, end-to-end solution for managing vehicle titles and registrations and annual renewals. We provide automated title and registration solutions by leveraging connections with individual departments of motor vehicles for electronic title and registration processing in 20 states. Title and registration solutions accounted for approximately 2% of our 2021 revenues.
Government Solutions
We serve as a value-add partner to local government agencies by providing photo enforcement solutions that promote traffic safety and reduce traffic violations. We work with our customers to identify problematic traffic areas and install, maintain, and manage the technology platform needed to capture images or videos of drivers committing traffic violations. Red-light cameras are placed at intersections to capture vehicles running red lights. Similarly, speed safety cameras are used to capture vehicles exceeding speed limits, either on a fixed basis or in a mobile platform, and often in school zones. School bus cameras are fixed to the side of buses to capture vehicles passing school buses with extended stop arms. Finally, bus lane cameras are designed to capture vehicles illegally driving in restricted bus lanes.
Applying rules specified by each customer, we automatically send the captured event to the designated enforcement agency of the customer, where an authorized individual determines if a violation occurred. Direct

service revenue from red-light cameras, speed cameras, school bus cameras, and city bus lane cameras accounted for approximately 38% of our 2021 revenues. Other segment service revenue consists primarily of ancillary revenue streams, which comprised 3% of total revenue. Product sales to customers are not recurring and are dependent on our customers’ needs, and account for 10% of total revenue.
 
Parking Solutions
 Parking Access and Revenue Control
 Our Parking Access and Revenue Control (“PARCS”) technology solutions include both software and hardware offerings which work in concert to help our customers manage their gated, gateless and license plate recognition-based parking lot and parking garage needs. We have installed over 2,000 PARCS lanes to date. Our related software is the industry’s original hosted parking management software, which allows management of our customers’ PARCS solutions from a computer or mobile device.
Pay Stations
 Our pay stations hardware technology has interoperability with over 50 third-party systems, as well as our PARCS and parking enforcement solutions. They are powered by a highly configurable and data driven software technology which supports the enforcement, mobile payments, and back-office and accounting needs of our customers. Our fleet of Pay Stations hardware exceeded 16,000 units at December 31, 2021.
Permits & Enforcement
 Our Permits & Enforcement (“PE”) software technology solutions allow our customers to control who is parking in their facilities and when and where drivers can park using physical or virtual permits, allowing customers to control traffic and maximize their parking-related revenues. This technology also provides enforcement officers with real-time information and custom notifications on their enforcement devices. Citations management features also help to organize fine escalations and notification letters to parking violators.
 Customers
We have a diverse customer base across the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada. We are a top provider of toll management solutions, violations management solutions, and title and registration solutions for nearly every major RAC and FMC provider nationwide, including the Hertz Corporation, Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Fox Rent a Car, Sixt Rent A Car, Element, ARI, Donlen and Wheels. In addition, we provide automated safety solutions to local government agencies including New York City, Nassau County (New York), Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, Orange County (Florida), Seattle, Highways England, New South Wales (Australia) and the Department of Justice and Community Safety in Victoria (Australia). We also provide end-to-end parking management solutions to universities, municipalities, parking operators, healthcare facilities and transportation hubs in North America. For many of our customers, we provide more than one product or service offering, addressing the diverse and varied needs of our clients.
Competition
There is no single competitor that provides a similarly broad suite of solutions. However, in our Government Solutions segment, we face competition in certain automated safety solutions from other vendors in the areas of red-light, school bus and speed photo enforcement. In our Commercial Services segment, we face competition from both our own customers, as they may choose to invest in their own internal solutions, and vendors offering or seeking to offer new technologies or financial models, and we must continue to innovate for our offerings to remain competitive. In Parking Solutions, we face competition from a variety of segment-specific competitors in our markets in the United States and Canada.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We take steps to protect new intellectual property to safeguard our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and believe we take appropriate action against infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement, and to identify strategic opportunities.

Our general policy is to seek patent protection for our inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. We own approximately 92 U.S.- and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. Patents expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages.
Our business relies on both internally developed and externally licensed software, as well as internally, externally and co-developed hardware, to operate and provide our systems and deliver our services. We claim copyright on all internally developed software. We generally rely on common law protection for our copyrighted works. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to assure our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software and hardware, we rely on contracts to retain our continued access for our business usage. From time to time, these agreements may expire or be subject to renegotiation.
 We have approximately 195 registrations and pending applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for trademarks and service marks, reflecting our many products and services. These registrations and applications include our historic and acquired brands, as well as Verra Mobility. These marks may have a perpetual life, subject to periodic renewal and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. We vigorously enforce and protect our marks.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices regulating matters such as data privacy, photo enforcement, consumer protection, procurement, licensing requirements, anti-kickback, equal employment, minimum wages and the environment, among others. Our operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, (“USDOT”), the Federal Trade Commission, (“FTC”), the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as comparable state and local agencies, including the departments of transportation, departments of motor vehicles, and offices of inspectors general, and laws related to financial and banking regulations. Following the acquisition of EPC and Pagatelia, and in connection with our European expansion efforts, we are subject to laws, regulations and administrative practices addressing many of these same matters in Europe, including those specifically relating to accessing and use of information obtained from vehicle licensing authorities, as well as European regulations to traffic enforcement and collections and other financial and banking regulations.
As part of our business, we collect, receive, process, use, transmit, disclose, and retain information relating to identifiable individuals (“personal information”) and, therefore, are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of personal information, including the U.S. Driver Privacy Protection Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union (the “E.U.”), the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom (the “UK Data Protection Act”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and other state privacy laws in the United States. We are also subject to similar restrictions and audit requirements pursuant to our contracts with the organizations from which we gain access to personal information, such as departments of motor vehicles and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System. Privacy laws and regulations are constantly evolving and changing, are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries and state and local jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in foreign countries, or as U.S. federal or state law changes, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements, including the GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act, the CCPA and other US state privacy laws, will increase. Laws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have also come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental authorities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for increased regulation and changes in industry practices. Our foreign photo enforcement programs are also subject to regulation in the various countries in which we operate.
 Automated photo enforcement camera programs in the United States are typically regulated at the state and local level, not the federal level. Since 2010, there have been over 1,500 pieces of legislation introduced nationwide related to the photo enforcement industry. In general, photo enforcement is administrated by local government agencies, under either state enabling legislation or under home rule authority established under the relevant state

constitution. Where enabling legislation is not required, local ordinances impose further restrictions within a given jurisdiction. Whether in a state requiring enabling legislation or in home-rule states where municipalities pass ordinances permitting photo enforcement, if the legislation or ordinance is subsequently repealed, not renewed if required, or if the authority for a local ordinance is revoked, photo enforcement activities would stop. At times, state Attorneys General have issued opinions interpreting photo enforcement laws and the permissibility of certain practices or other requirements of practice that further restrict private activities. For example, the Attorneys General of Arizona, Tennessee and Virginia have each issued opinions in recent years that impacted photo enforcement activities.
State and local regulation affects our Commercial Services segment as well, particularly with respect to tolling. Over the past few years, bills have been introduced in multiple states to limit whether and how much RACs can charge their customers for the use of a toll transponder, limit the administrative penalties and fees that can be assessed for processing tolls, and/or impose increased disclosure requirements on RACs with respect to tolling or violation processing fees. In addition, there has been an increase in interest and greater focus on RAC tolling programs from state Attorneys General related to tolling issues from a consumer protection perspective.
 Our Government Solutions customers are typically local government agencies, and our operations within this segment are therefore subject to various procurement laws pertaining to gifts and entertainment, payments of commissions and contingency fees, conflicts of interest, licensing and permitting requirements and other matters. These laws are overseen by different government agencies, depending on the jurisdiction, including departments of procurements services, contracting offices and offices of inspector general. In large municipalities, many of which have their own offices of the inspector general, these laws and regulations tend to be much more detailed and impose greater restrictions.
 To successfully navigate this regulatory landscape, we have a dedicated government relations team that works with state and local policymakers, often with the help of lobbyists and consultants, to track and help support favorable camera-enforcement safety and toll-related legislation. Through this network, we have a presence in most states in which our Government Solutions and Commercial Services segments do business. These lobbying activities are subject to state and local lobbying regulations and registration requirements.
In connection with the installation of photo enforcement systems, we or our customers routinely obtain permits from various state and local permitting authorities, and we monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations of the USDOT and state departments of transportation relating to matters such as training, policies and procedures. As a government contractor providing photo enforcement services directly or through subcontractors (including design, engineering, construction, installation, and maintenance) in various locations throughout the United States and internationally, we are at times required to obtain licenses regarding general contracting, performance of engineering services, performance of electrical work, performance of private investigative work and processing license plate and related personal information, and periodically receive notices from regulatory authorities regarding these matters and inquiring as to our compliance with the applicable state, local and foreign laws and regulations.
We believe we are in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate our business. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, fines, penalties, revocation of permits or licenses, cessation of operations in a given jurisdiction and other adverse consequences. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.
 Human Capital Management
 
Our employees are critical to our success as a leading provider of smart mobility solutions. To continue producing and delivering high-quality solutions and services to our customers, and to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is critical that we continue to attract, retain and develop a diverse group of talented individuals at all levels of our organization.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,433 employees, comprised of 1,306 full-time employees and 127 part-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 933 were located in the United States and 373 were located internationally. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining

agreement, except for our 29 employees in Staten Island, New York. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have not experienced a strike or other significant work stoppage.
 
Talent Acquisition and Development
 
Our success depends upon attracting, retaining and developing a diverse group of talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals, contribute their own unique perspective and skill set and create long-term value for our stockholders. We have implemented purposeful hiring strategies that include opportunities for internal mobility and promotion and an employee referral program, both of which we believe will further strengthen our growing employee base and promote retention at our Company. Of the 311 positions filled in fiscal 2021, 57 were internal candidates or referred by current Verra Mobility employees. We have a multifaceted talent development framework that includes functional training, management training and targeted development problems, such as our Six Sigma training that aims to further enhance operational skills in our Government Solutions business unit. We also develop our employees through an annual performance review and assessment process that incorporates a dual-performance rating system and provides each employee with concrete, actionable feedback that will enable them to succeed at our Company.
Compensation and Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s and individual performance, and to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentives for both short-term and long-term performance. In addition to cash compensation, we offer employees benefits such as health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, accident insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave and a company-sponsored 401(k) plan, and related benefits for non-U.S. employees. For key leadership positions, we also provide compensation packages that include annual incentive bonuses and long-term equity awards.
Employee Engagement
 
We seek employees who collaborate and value differences, think and act globally, foster an engaging climate, and recognize and develop others. We engage and survey our employee population to gather insight, feedback, and data about employees’ engagement, workplace experiences, and manager effectiveness. Survey results inform and support corporate, business unit, department, and team action plans, with the goal of enhancing workplace satisfaction and overall employee well-being and effectiveness.
Corporate Information
 We were originally incorporated in Delaware on August 15, 2016, under the name “Gores Holdings II, Inc.” (“Gores”) as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On January 19, 2017, Gores consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”), following which its shares began trading on Nasdaq. On June 21, 2018, Gores entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with Greenlight Holding II Corporation, PE Greenlight Holdings, LLC (the “Platinum Stockholder”), AM Merger Sub I, Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Gores, and AM Merger Sub II, LLC, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Gores.
