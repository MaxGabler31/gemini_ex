--------+---------

General
 Cabot is a global specialty chemicals and performance materials company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Our principal products are reinforcing and specialty carbons, specialty compounds, conductive carbons, carbon nanotubes, fumed metal oxides, inkjet colorants, and aerogel. Cabot and its affiliates have manufacturing facilities and operations in the United States (“U.S.”) and over 20 other countries. Cabot’s business was founded in 1882 and incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1960. The terms “Cabot”, “Company”, “we”, and “our” as used in this report refer to Cabot Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 In 2016, we adopted our “Advancing the Core” strategy to extend our leadership in performance materials by investing for growth in our core businesses, driving application innovation with our customers, and generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization. Following the successful execution of our “Advancing the Core” strategy, we introduced our “Creating for Tomorrow” growth strategy in early fiscal 2022. This new strategy is focused on investing for advantaged growth, developing innovative products and processes that enable a better future, and driving continuous improvement in all we do. Our products are generally based on technical expertise and innovation in one or more of our four core competencies: making and handling very fine particles; modifying the surfaces of very fine particles to alter their functionality; designing particles to impart specific properties to a formulation; and combining particles with other ingredients to deliver a formulated performance intermediate or composite. We focus on creating particles, and formulations of those particles, with the composition, morphology, and surface functionalities to deliver the requisite performance to support our customers’ existing and emerging applications.
 Our business is currently organized into two reportable segments: Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our Purification Solutions business, which, prior to the sale, had been a separate reportable segment of the Company. Our business segments are discussed in more detail later in this section.
 Both of our segments operate globally, and a significant portion of our revenues and operating profits is derived from operations outside the U.S. In particular, China continues to be an important producer of tires and products for automotive applications and since we made our initial investment in China in 1988, we have increased our operations in China to support increased demand for our products in China. In addition, a significant portion of battery manufacturers are located in China, and we anticipate a material portion of the future growth of our Battery Materials growth vector to be derived from our business and operations in China. We employ local management teams for our operations in China, and our business model in China is predominantly to make and sell product in-country to established local and multi-national customers with operations in China. In fiscal 2022, sales in China across our segments constituted approximately 25% of our revenues, and our property, plant and equipment located in China constituted approximately 25% of our total property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2022 as disclosed in Note T to our Consolidated Financial Statements. There are legal and operational risks associated with having substantial operations in China, which are more fully described under the heading “Risk Factors”, including the risks described under the headings: “We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries, including China”; “Information technology systems failures, data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations”; “The continued protection of patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights is important to our success”; “Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations, as well as regional conflicts, may adversely impact our business” and “Our tax rate and other tax obligations are dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and financial results”. Given the size of our current operations in China and the future growth we anticipate from those operations, if our ability to operate in China were to be constrained by legal, regulatory and operational risks, it could have a material negative impact on our overall operations and the value of our securities.

 Reinforcement Materials
 Products
 Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied size, structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications. Reinforcing carbons (a class of carbon blacks manufactured by Cabot) are used to enhance the physical properties of the systems and applications in which they are incorporated.
 4

Our reinforcing carbons products are used in tires and industrial products. Reinforcing carbons have traditionally been used in the tire industry as a rubber reinforcing agent to increase tread durability and are also used as a performance additive to reduce rolling resistance and improve traction. In industrial products such as hoses, belts, extruded profiles and molded goods, reinforcing carbons are used to improve the physical performance of the product, including the product’s physical strength, fluid resistance, conductivity and resistivity.
 In addition to our reinforcing carbons, we manufacture engineered elastomer composites (“E2C™”) solutions that are composites of reinforcing carbons and rubber made using our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process. These composites improve abrasion/wear resistance, reduce fatigue of rubber parts and reduce rolling resistance compared to reinforcing carbons/rubber compounds made entirely by conventional rubber mix methods enabling rubber product manufacturers to reduce the need to make performance trade-offs. The use of E2C™ solutions enables our customers to produce better performing tires, including giant off-the-road tires, truck tires and retreaded tires, as well as other rubber products used in aggressive applications. Additionally, because E2C™ solutions can be integrated into current product methods without additional significant capital investment, and require fewer mixing stages, lower mixing temperatures and shorter mixing cycles than conventional products, operating and production costs may be reduced. 
 Drivers of Demand and Sales and Customers
 Demand for our Reinforcement Materials products is largely driven by the growth and development of the tire and automotive industries. In addition to general global economic conditions, demand for reinforcing carbons in tires is mainly influenced by the number of replacement and original equipment tires produced, which in turn is driven by (i) vehicle and driving trends, including the number of miles driven, and the number of vehicles produced and registered, (ii) demand for high-performance tires, (iii) demand for larger tires and larger vehicles, such as trucks, buses, off-road vehicles used in agriculture, mining and similar vehicles, (iv) consumer and industrial spending on new vehicles and (v) changes in regulatory requirements impacting vehicle fuel efficiency and tire regulations. Demand for reinforcing carbons for industrial products is mainly influenced by vehicle production and design trends, construction activity and general industrial production. 
 Demand in the developed Western European, Japanese, and North American regions is mainly driven by demographic changes, customers’ high-quality requirements, stringent tire regulation standards, changes in consumer preference (e.g., different tire sizes, model and powertrain types), and relatively stable tire replacement demand. Demand in developing markets, such as China, Southeastern Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, is mainly driven by the growing middle class, rapid industrialization, infrastructure spending and increasing car ownership trends. The growth in vehicle production in turn drives demand for both original equipment tires and replacement tires in developing regions.
 Sales of reinforcing carbons and E2C™ solutions are made primarily by Cabot employees and secondarily through distributors and sales representatives. We typically “make and sell” in region, which, among other advantages, provides our customers a regional supply chain and typically reduces transportation costs. Sales to five major tire customers represent a material portion of Reinforcement Materials’ total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could have a material adverse effect on the segment.
 Under appropriate circumstances, we have entered into supply arrangements with certain customers, the typical duration of which is one year. These arrangements typically provide for sales price adjustments to account for changes in relevant feedstock indices including natural gas and, in many cases, changes in other relevant costs (such as the cost of CO2 credits in Europe). In fiscal 2022, approximately two-thirds of our reinforcing carbons volume was sold under these supply arrangements. The majority of the volumes sold under these arrangements are sold to customers in the Americas and Europe.
 We licensed our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process to Manufacture Francaise des Pneumatiques Michelin for their exclusive use in tire applications through fiscal 2017, and for a period of limited exclusivity in tire applications through fiscal 2019. As consideration, we receive quarterly royalty payments extending through calendar year 2022.
 Much of the reinforcing carbons we sell is used in tires and automotive products and, therefore, our financial results may be affected by the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. However, a large portion of the market for our products is in replacement tires that historically has been less cyclical as demand for replacement tires is correlated to miles driven. 
 Competition
 We are one of the leading manufacturers of carbon black in the world. We compete in the sale of reinforcing carbons with four companies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside their region of manufacture. Competition for our Reinforcement Materials products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, price, service, technical innovation, and logistics. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, global manufacturing presence, operations and logistics excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage.

Raw Materials
 The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our reinforcing carbons is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of our reinforcing carbons. Raw materials are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. Raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of our feedstocks and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. 
Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce reinforcing carbons in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and the U.S. An equity affiliate operates a reinforcing carbons plant in Venezuela. In addition, we have a 98% ownership interest in an entity that manufactures our E2C™ products in Port Dickson, Malaysia.
 The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2022 in operations in which we own less than 100%:
 
 
Location | Percentage Interest 
-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------
Shanghai, China | 70% (consolidated subsidiary) 
Tianjin, China | 70% (consolidated subsidiary) 
Xingtai City, China | 60% (consolidated subsidiary) 
Valasske Mezirici (Valmez), Czech Republic | 52% (consolidated subsidiary) 
Cilegon, Indonesia Port Dickson,Malaysia | 98% (consolidated subsidiary) 98% (consolidated subsidiary)
Valencia, Venezuela | 49% (equity affiliate) 

 
During fiscal 2019, we began engineering work on an expansion of our Cilegon, Indonesia plant, which would have added approximately 90,000 metric tons of capacity for reinforcing carbons to our network. In fiscal 2020, after a review of our capital allocation priorities, we temporarily suspended further work on this expansion and currently expect to recommence work on this project at a later time.
 One of the main environmental challenges of a carbon black plant is the management of exhaust gas from production processes. This exhaust gas contains a number of regulated pollutants, including carbon monoxide and sulfur compounds. Our most common method for controlling these gases is through combustion, which produces useable energy as a by-product. Currently, nine reinforcing carbons manufacturing sites and four reinforcing carbons/specialty carbons manufacturing sites have energy centers, which allow us to utilize these gases through some form of energy co-generation, such as the sale or reuse of steam, gas or electricity. Depending on our capacity utilization, our energy centers generally reduce our manufacturing operating costs. In addition, we generate revenues from our energy center sales.
 Performance Chemicals
 Our Performance Chemicals reporting segment is organized into two businesses: our Performance Additives business and our Formulated Solutions business. Our Performance Additives business combines our specialty carbons, battery materials, fumed metal oxides and aerogel product lines, and our Formulated Solutions business combines our specialty compounds and inkjet product lines.
 In Performance Chemicals, we design, manufacture and sell materials that deliver performance in a broad range of customer applications across the automotive, construction, infrastructure, inkjet printing, electronics, and consumer products sectors and in applications related to the generation, transmission and storage of energy. Our focus areas for growth include conductive carbon additives and other materials for battery applications, and inkjet dispersions for post print corrugated packaging applications. The investments we have made for growth in this segment, including in respect of these specific areas of focus, are described below under the heading “Operations”.
 Products
 Performance Additives Business
 Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications.

Our specialty carbons are used to impart color, provide rheology control, enhance conductivity and static charge control, provide UV protection, enhance mechanical properties, and provide formulation flexibility through surface treatment. These specialty carbon products are used in a wide variety of applications, such as plastics, which applications represent the largest use for our products, inks, coatings, adhesives, toners, batteries, and displays.
 Our battery materials products include our conductive carbon additives and fumed alumina, which are used principally in advanced lead acid and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. Our conductive carbon additives consist of conductive carbons, carbon nanotubes and carbon nano-structures, and blends of these materials, each of which offers different levels of conductivity and formulation flexibility for battery manufacturers to address performance (energy density, fast charging), cost and safety. In lithium-ion batteries, our conductive carbon additives are used in both cathode and anode applications to increase energy density by providing a conductive network between active materials. Fumed alumina is used to reduce cathode material and electrolyte decomposition and improve capacity retention leading to longer cycle life. 
 Fumed silica is an ultra-fine, high-purity particle used as a reinforcing, thickening, abrasive, thixotropic, suspending or anti-caking agent in a wide variety of products for the automotive, construction, microelectronics, batteries, and consumer products industries. These products include adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, batteries, inks, toners, silicone elastomers, coatings, polishing slurries and pharmaceuticals. In addition to its battery applications, fumed alumina, also an ultra-fine, high-purity particle, is used as an abrasive, absorbent or barrier agent in a variety of products, such as inkjet media, lighting, coatings, cosmetics and polishing slurries.
 Aerogel is a hydrophobic, silica-based particle with a high surface area that is used in a variety of thermal insulation and specialty chemical applications. In the building and construction industry, the product is used in insulative sprayable plasters and composite building products, as well as translucent skylight, window, wall and roof systems for insulating eco-daylighting applications. In the specialty chemicals industry, the product is used to provide matte finishing, insulating and thickening properties for use in a variety of applications including thermal management for lithium-ion batteries.
 Formulated Solutions Business
 Our masterbatch and conductive compound products, which we refer to as “specialty compounds”, are formulations derived from specialty carbons mixed with polymers and other additives. These products are generally used by plastic resin producers and converters in applications for the automotive, industrial, packaging, infrastructure, agriculture, consumer products, and electronics industries. As an alternative to directly mixing specialty carbon blacks, these formulations offer greater ease of handling and help customers achieve their desired levels of dispersion and color and manage the addition of small doses of additives. In addition, our electrically conductive compound products generally are used to help ensure uniform conductive performance and reduce risks associated with electrostatic discharge in plastics applications.
 Our inkjet colorants are high-quality pigment-based black and color dispersions and inks. Our dispersions are based on our patented pigment surface modification technology and polymer encapsulation technology. The dispersions are used in aqueous inkjet inks to impart color, sharp print characteristics and durability, while maintaining high printhead reliability. These products are used in various inkjet printing applications, including traditional work-from-home and corporate office settings, and, increasingly, in commercial and corrugated packaging, that all require a high level of dispersibility and colloidal stability. Our inkjet inks, which utilize our pigment-based colorant dispersions, are used in the commercial printing segment for digital print.
 Drivers of Demand and Sales and Customers
 Our specialty carbons products have a wide variety of end-uses and demand is largely driven by the growth and development of the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. Demand for our conductive carbon additives for use in batteries is largely driven by the trend in electrification of vehicles. Demand for fumed silica is mainly influenced by trends in key markets for silicones, adhesives and coatings applications, notably, structural adhesives for automobile light-weighting, epoxy bonding paste for wind turbines, high-performance coatings and hybrid sealants for construction and silicones for medical devices and the proliferation of electronics. Demand for specialty compounds is mainly influenced by growth and development of the automotive, infrastructure, consumer goods and electronic devices, packaging and agriculture industries. 
 Demand for our inkjet colorants is mainly influenced by developments in print media, pages printed in office and work-from-home environments, as well as press sales and utilization levels as digital aqueous pigment-based inks penetrate commercial and packaging applications historically served by analog printing methods. 
 Sales of these products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. In our specialty carbons and specialty compounds product lines, sales are generally to a broad number of customers. In our fumed metal oxides product line, sales under contracts with six customers account for approximately one-third of the revenue. In our battery materials product line, we have made commercial sales to six of eight leading global battery producers, with new product programs under discussion at all eight.

Competition
 We are a leading producer of the products we sell in this segment. We compete in the sale of carbon black with three companies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside their region of manufacture. For battery applications, we compete primarily with three companies that manufacture conductive carbons, a small number of China-based companies that manufacture carbon nanotubes, and one manufacturer of fumed alumina that operates globally. For fumed silica, we compete with two companies with a global presence and several other companies that have a regional presence. For aerogel, we compete principally with one other company that produces aerogel products. We also compete with non-aerogel insulation products manufactured by regional companies throughout the world. For specialty compounds, we compete with many regional companies and a small number of global companies. Our inkjet colorants and inks are designed to replace traditional pigment dispersions and dyes used in inkjet printing applications. Competitive products for inkjet colorants are organic dyes and other dispersed pigments manufactured and marketed by large chemical companies and small independent producers.
 Competition for our Performance Chemicals products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical innovation and price. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, operations excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage.
 Raw Materials
 Raw materials for our products are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our specialty carbons is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of our specialty carbons. These raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of our feedstocks and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. Changes in certain of our raw material supplier’s operating conditions could reduce the availability of certain very specialized feedstocks.
 The principal raw material used in the manufacture of conductive carbons is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world.  Natural gas is also used in the production of our conductive carbons. As product purity is one of the most critical requirements for conductive carbons, we obtain our raw materials from selected key suppliers. The primary raw materials for our carbon nanotubes are catalysts that we synthesize and propylene.
 Raw materials for the production of fumed silica are various chlorosilane feedstocks. We purchase feedstocks and for certain customers convert their feedstock to product on a fee-basis (so called “toll conversion”). We also purchase aluminum chloride as feedstock for the production of fumed alumina. We have long-term procurement contracts or arrangements in place for the purchase of fumed silica feedstock primarily from fence-line partners, which we believe will enable us to meet our raw material requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we buy some raw materials in the spot market to help ensure flexibility and minimize costs. The principal raw materials for the production of aerogel are silica sol and/or sodium silicate.
 The primary raw materials used for our specialty compounds include carbon black, primarily sourced from our carbon black plants, prime and recycled thermoplastic resins and mineral fillers supplied from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet colorants include carbon black sourced from our carbon black plants, organic pigments and other treating agents available from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet inks include pigment dispersions, solvents and other additives.
 Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce specialty carbons primarily in China, the Netherlands and the U.S. We produce our conductive carbon additives in China, and at our specialty carbon plants in the U.S. and in the Netherlands. We also own, or have a controlling interest in, manufacturing plants that produce fumed metal oxides in China, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and the U.S. and a manufacturing plant that produces aerogel in Frankfurt, Germany. An equity affiliate operates a fumed metal oxides plant in India. Our specialty compounds are predominately produced in facilities that we own, or have a controlling interest in, located in Belgium, Canada, China and the United Arab Emirates. Our inkjet colorants and inks are manufactured at our facility in the U.S.
 The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2022 in operations in which we own less than 100%:

Currently, four of our reinforcing carbons/specialty carbons manufacturing sites have energy centers.
 We are investing for growth with a number of capacity expansion projects and other transactions, particularly to increase manufacturing capacity for our specialty carbons and battery materials products, as described below. 
 To strengthen our formulations capabilities for batteries, in April 2020, we acquired carbon nanotube producer Shenzhen Sanshun Nano New Materials Co., Ltd. Along with additional technology capabilities, this acquisition added a manufacturing facility in Zhuhai, China to our manufacturing network, and in July 2022 we completed the first phase of a debottleneck project to expand our carbon nanotube dispersion capacity at this facility. In March 2022, we completed our purchase from Tokai Carbon Group of its carbon black manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China, and subsequently began technical upgrades to convert certain manufacturing units to allow us to produce conductive carbon additives. We expect the conversion of the first unit at the site, which is specifically targeted to support the growth of our battery materials product line, to be completed in fiscal 2024. We are also manufacturing reinforcing carbons at this facility. Further, during fiscal 2022, we completed certain planned technical upgrades at our plant in Xuzhou, China to produce specialty carbons and the plant became operational during the third quarter. We expect this facility will allow us to improve our specialty carbons production network to meet customer demand across a wide range of applications while freeing up additional capacity for conductive carbons in our global network to support growth in our battery materials product line.
 To meet the growing demand in the inkjet market for digital printing applications, in April 2022 we began construction of a new production line at our manufacturing plant in Haverhill, Massachusetts, U.S., to increase our global capacity for aqueous pigment dispersions. We expect this new production line to be operational in fiscal 2023.
 In our specialty compounds business, to meet anticipated demand we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity with a new specialty compounds unit at our reinforcing carbons plant in Cilegon, Indonesia, which we expect to be completed in fiscal 2023.
 Purification Solutions
 We completed the sale of our activated carbon business in March 2022.
 Patents and Trademarks
 We own and are a licensee of various patents, which expire at different times, covering many of our products as well as processes and product uses. Although the products made and sold under these patents and licenses are important to Cabot, the loss of any particular patent or license would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole. We sell our products under a variety of trademarks we own and take reasonable measures to protect them. While our trademarks are important to Cabot, the loss of any one of our trademarks would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole.
Research and Development
 Our products are highly versatile and meet specific performance requirements across many industries, creating opportunities for innovation. In each of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we spent approximately $55 million on technology development. Our R&D activities included those focused in the areas of conductive carbon additives, inkjet dispersions and engineered elastomer composites. We are also focused on process innovation across our product lines. We are investing in furthering our sustainability efforts across various areas in order to reduce waste, reduce emissions and utilize more sustainable material in our production processes. 
Seasonality
 Our businesses are generally not seasonal in nature, although we may experience some regional seasonal declines during holiday periods.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our success is realized through the engagement and commitment of our people. We believe that our globally distributed workforce positions us well to serve our broad customer base in the regions and geographies in which they operate. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 4,200 employees across our global network of office and manufacturing locations, with 40% of our employees located in the Americas (61% of whom are in the United States), 34% in Asia Pacific (77% of whom are in China), and 26% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”). Of this global employee population, 43% are employed in manufacturing roles. 
 Our Management Executive Committee (“Executive Committee”) is comprised of our CEO and his nine direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our businesses and regional operations, our financial, legal, safety, health, environment, and sustainability, human resources, research and development, global business services, and digital functions.
 Our primary human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe, supported and empowered to do their best work. Accordingly, our management team places significant focus and attention on 
 9

matters concerning Cabot’s workforce – particularly in the areas of diversity, talent retention and development, total rewards, and employee health and safety. These areas of focus are also represented in our 2025 Sustainability Goals, which include:
 •
fostering an environment where employees report high levels of inclusion and support for their professional development;
 •
increasing diverse representation in leadership and professional roles; and
 •
reducing injuries and frequency of significant process safety events by 50%.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)
 In support of our commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive environment, in fiscal 2022 we introduced a new DE&I strategy focused on increasing diverse representation, education and awareness of DE&I practices, and ensuring equitable policies and practices. In support of this strategy, we: 
  
• | Further developed our diversity recruiting capabilities to better attract, source and hire diverse talent through training all recruiters on diversity recruiting best practices, introducing new channels to source diverse talent, and improving our data collection and reporting capabilities to better track our progress.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Emphasized the need for local teams to engage in DE&I efforts based on what is most relevant for them with support from our employee resource groups (ERGs) and local DE&I councils.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducted a global employee DE&I pulse survey to measure progress on our goals and help us determine where improvement is needed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established DE&I objectives and metrics that will inform funding levels for our short-term incentive compensation awards in fiscal 2023. These objectives are: demonstrating improvement in percent of job searches in which diverse candidates are interviewed, ensuring strong pay equity is maintained with action plans in place to address any pay inequity identified through our global compensation review process, and requiring all people managers attend inclusive leadership training.

 Talent Retention and Development
 We have numerous initiatives and programs to attract, develop and retain our talent tailored to specific employee populations and geographies, including leadership and executive development programs, technical training, and other skill-based training. In fiscal 2022, we introduced a new Leadership Acceleration program to further enhance the skills and effectiveness of our mid-level leaders. We also introduced an online learning platform to support our leadership development programs, DE&I knowledge and skill building, and self-directed learning aligned with our career development portal for employees. 
 We have well-established performance management and talent development processes in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees. Throughout the year, managers and employees engage in annual objective setting, 
 10

quarterly reviews of goal progress, performance feedback, career development discussions, and a year-end performance evaluation. In addition, we regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions and business segments to identify and develop a pipeline of talent.
 Some of our employees in the U.S. and abroad are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. We have generally positive and productive employee relations with our employees, unions and works councils globally. 
 Cabot’s global voluntary turnover rate for fiscal 2022 was approximately 9.0%, which represents a slight increase in the company’s attrition rate relative to fiscal 2021, which was 8.5%.
 Total Rewards 
 We strive to provide a total rewards program that enables us to attract, retain and motivate the best talent to support our businesses. Our compensation programs embrace a pay for performance philosophy and are designed to be competitive within the markets in which we compete for talent. Our pay practices reward individual and Company performance and are equitably differentiated based on role, experience, contributions, and performance. We regularly assess these practices to ensure we are aligning roles with compensation levels based on job responsibilities, market competitiveness, geographic location, strategic importance of roles and other relevant factors.
 Cabot is committed to ensuring that employees are paid fairly, without discrimination while taking into account job-related factors such as responsibilities, location, work experience, education, performance, and contributions. We conduct reviews annually to monitor our pay practices and develop pay actions where appropriate. Our most recent analysis (which did not include employees under certain collective bargaining or similar agreements) indicated that we have strong pay parity between females and males globally as well as with People of Color in the United States across all pay components (annual base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives) for those in the same job and location. 
 We also aim to provide competitive benefits programs in all the locations where we operate, including meeting or exceeding local regulations and focusing on health and welfare, employee well-being, and retirement savings. We recognize employee needs are changing as they continue to adjust to new work environments, deal with stress and balance home and work life while managing their own health and safety, along with that of their loved ones. We believe that advancing employee health and well-being is important to Cabot’s success, and as a result, in fiscal 2022 we:
  
• | Introduced flexible well-being spending accounts for our U.S. and Canadian employees
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducted leadership focus groups to better understand well-being opportunities and concerns
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employee Health & Safety 
 We believe that one of our primary responsibilities as an employer is to provide a safe work environment and promote wellness across the workforce. Our goal is for all employees, contractors, and visitors to return home in the same condition as when they arrived at work that day. As part of our “Drive to Zero” initiative, we have set a long-term goal of achieving zero injuries at our facilities worldwide. We intend to achieve this ambitious objective by following a number of measures, including training employees in hazard recognition, ensuring procedures are established to mitigate risks and equipping supervisory personnel with the tools and skills required to execute our work safely. As part of this effort, members of our leadership team participate in root cause determinations and the results are shared throughout our network of operating facilities. Recognizing that it may take many years to achieve our Drive to Zero goal, we have established a continuous improvement goal for personal safety to achieve a 50% reduction in our recordable and severe injury rate from our baseline measurement in 2019 by 2025. For fiscal 2022, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) based upon the number of injuries per 200,000 work hours for both employees and contractors was 0.29 and our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was 0.17. For comparison, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports for chemical manufacturing an average TRIR of 2.0 and LTIR of 0.8 in calendar year 2021. 
 We continue to be recognized as an American Chemistry Counsel Responsible Care® company and as part of our commitment to Responsible Care, we remain focused on continuously improving the health and safety of our processes and products. In accordance with this certification, we report our safety performance metrics annually and undergo external audits regularly to evaluate our program, identify gaps, and undertake corrective actions as needed. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we put in place additional health and safety protocols at our sites. We continue to monitor and revise these protocols as appropriate to address the evolving nature of the pandemic.

Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability
 In recognition of the importance of safety, health, environment and sustainability matters to Cabot, our Board of Directors has a Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability Committee. The Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, meets regularly and oversees our safety, health, and environmental performance, process safety, security, product stewardship, community engagement and governmental affairs. In particular, the Committee reviews metrics, audit results, emerging trends, overall performance, risks and opportunity assessments and management processes related to our safety, health, environmental and sustainability program. 
 Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters (“SH&E Requirements”). The SH&E Requirements to which our operations are subject include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities and for product registrations. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities throughout the world for safety, health and environmental protection and to comply with SH&E Requirements. We spent $80 million in environmental-related capital expenditures in fiscal 2022. We anticipate spending approximately $92 million for such matters in fiscal 2023, a significant portion of which will continue to be for the installation of air pollution control equipment at our plant in Ville Platte, Louisiana. These costs include costs associated with our compliance with the Consent Decree we entered into in November 2013 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) regarding Cabot’s three carbon black manufacturing facilities in the U.S. This settlement is related to the EPA’s national enforcement initiative focused on the U.S. carbon black manufacturing sector alleging non-compliance with certain regulatory and permitting requirements under The Clean Air Act, including the New Source Review (“NSR”) construction permitting requirements. Pursuant to this settlement, Cabot has installed technology controls for sulfur dioxide and/or nitrogen oxide at its carbon black plants in Pampa, Texas and Franklin, Louisiana, and is in the process of installing such technology controls at its plant in Ville Platte. We are currently in discussions with the EPA and LDEQ to extend our compliance date at the Ville Platte facility to mid 2024 based upon force majeure events primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that the total capital costs to install these technology controls will be in the range of $225 million to $250 million and will be incurred through fiscal 2024. As of September 30, 2022, we have incurred approximately $145 million to install these controls in the U.S. Operating these controls increases our plant operating costs. All carbon black manufacturers in the U.S. have settled with the EPA and are installing similar controls. In addition, under the Province of Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks’ ("MECP”) Regulation 419, a new requirement for sulfur dioxide emissions goes into effect in July 2023 for our reinforcing carbons plant in Sarnia, Ontario. We are working with the MECP on a new technical standard for sulfur dioxide air emissions controls at our plant as an alternative to this requirement. Regulatory approval of the new standard is required and, if we do not receive approval prior to July 2023, we anticipate entering into an interim compliance order until such standard is in place. We anticipate we will need to incur capital costs for these new controls although the timing for such spend is uncertain.

As described above, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. In addition, growing concerns about climate change and an increased focus on carbon neutrality have led to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will impact the carbon black industry and our business as carbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. Currently, in Europe, our four carbon black facilities are subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (“EU ETS”). The fourth phase of the EU ETS began in January 2021 with updated product benchmarks for our carbon black facilities. In addition, our carbon black facility in The Netherlands is subject to The Netherlands CO2 tax, which is a top-off tax to the EU ETS scheme, and in 2021 was assessed a CO2 tax. We do not expect to be assessed a supplemental Netherlands CO2 tax in 2022-2025 as EUA pricing is expected to remain higher than the Netherlands CO2 tax threshold in the next few years. In China, a national emissions trading program is currently in place for the power sector and has not yet been expanded beyond that sector. We continue to monitor that program’s further implementation and expect it to apply to the carbon black industry in 2023 or 2024, with the existing pilot programs expected to continue to operate until the national program becomes effective. In Canada, our carbon black manufacturing facility has been subject to the Canadian federal carbon tax program. The new Ontario Emissions Performance Standard trading system will replace the Canadian federal Output-Based Pricing System for our carbon black facility in Ontario, and specific transition requirements became effective on January 1, 2022. In Mexico, our carbon black facility is participating in the pilot national ETS program, which is expected to be effective in 2023. A carbon tax was adopted in the Tamaulipas state, where our operations in Mexico are located, that became effective on January 1, 2021. We are appealing the applicability of this tax on our operations. In other regions where we operate, some of our facilities are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions but are not currently subject to programs requiring trading or emission controls but may be subject to limited carbon tax programs affecting fuels we purchase. We generally expect to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits as needed to respond to any allocation shortfalls and pass these costs on to our customers. In addition, further air emission regulations may be adopted in the future in regions and countries where we operate, which could have an impact on our operations. Increasing regulatory programs associated with emissions and concerns regarding climate change are expected to increase our capital and operational costs in the future.
 Cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the “Superfund law”) and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites primarily associated with our divested businesses. (See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below, and Note S in Item 8 below, under the heading “Contingencies”.) During the next several years, as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out, we expect to spend against our environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation. As of September 30, 2022, our environmental reserve was approximately $4 million. Adjustments are made to the reserve based on our continuing analysis of our share of costs likely to be incurred at each site. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates due to unknown conditions at the various sites, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and changing technologies for handling site investigation and remediation. While the reserve represents our best estimate of the costs we expect to incur, the actual costs to investigate and remediate these sites may exceed the amounts accrued in the environmental reserve. While it is always possible that an unusual event may occur with respect to a given site and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period, we do not believe that the costs relating to these sites, in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Furthermore, it is possible that we may also incur future costs relating to environmental liabilities not currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate.
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”) classifies carbon black as a Group 2B substance (known animal carcinogen, possible human carcinogen). We have communicated IARC’s classification of carbon black to our customers and employees and have included that information in our safety data sheets and elsewhere, as appropriate. We continue to believe that the available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that carbon black is not carcinogenic to humans, and does not present a health hazard when handled in accordance with good housekeeping and safe workplace practices as described in our safety data sheets.
 Our products are subject to the chemical control laws and regulatory requirements of the countries in which they are manufactured or imported and distributed commercially. These laws include the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACh”) in the European Union. Manufacturers or importers of these chemical substances are required to submit specified health, safety, environment, risk and use information about these substances. Under the “Evaluation” portion of the REACh framework, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and European Union Member States assess the information submitted by companies within registration dossiers and testing proposals to determine whether the associated substances are safe for use. The silica substance evaluation was concluded in 2022, and from this, a proposal for additional regulatory requirements related to silica is expected to be issued.  Carbon black is scheduled for a substance review in 2024. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including the UK, Turkey, Eurasia, China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Many of these chemical control regulations are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for product/substance registrations or notifications.

Additional requirements for nanomaterials apply to many of our existing products including carbon black, fumed silica, inkjet pigments, fumed alumina, and advanced carbons such as carbon nanostructures and carbon nanotubes. Country-specific nanomaterial reporting programs have been implemented in some countries and are being developed by others. In the European Union, application-specific safety evaluations are ongoing for nanomaterials.  Silica is currently being re-evaluated for use as a food additive and cosmetic ingredient. Additionally, in 2022, a subset of multi-walled carbon nanotubes that includes a carbon nanotube grade we currently manufacture, were classified as carcinogen category 1B and specific target organ toxicant (lung) after repeated exposure category 1 under European Union regulations.  Our carbon nanotubes are bound in a matrix or contained within conductive materials in batteries, molded parts, plastics, coatings, adhesives, and sealants, and we do not believe they present a health risk to consumers under normal use conditions. Exposure to carbon nanotubes could occur in the workplace. However, we believe workplace exposures can be appropriately managed with engineering controls in place at our manufacturing facilities and the use of required personal protective equipment at our sites. We intend to continue to monitor developments with respect to, and comply with requirements for, the safe manufacturing and handling of nanomaterials. 
 A number of organizations and regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on the issue of water scarcity, water conservation and water quality, particularly in certain geographic regions. We are engaged in various activities to promote water conservation and wastewater recycling, particularly given that some of our manufacturing processes are water intensive. The costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 Various U.S. agencies and international bodies have adopted security requirements applicable to certain manufacturing and industrial facilities and marine port locations. These security-related requirements involve the preparation of security assessments and security plans in some cases, and in other cases the registration of certain facilities with specified governmental authorities. We closely monitor all security-related regulatory developments and believe we are in compliance with all existing requirements. Compliance with such requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
