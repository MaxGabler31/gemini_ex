Item 1. Business
Overview
Eventbrite is a global self-service ticketing and experience technology platform that serves event creators and empowers their success. Our mission is to bring the world together through live experiences, and since inception, we have been at the center of the experience economy, helping to transform the way people organize and attend events.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has tested our mission, our company, and the events industry. Despite the non-linear nature of the ongoing recovery, we are entering 2022 with confidence in our strategy, a strong connection to the needs of creators, and a disciplined team. In 2020, as government and third-party preventative and protective measures limited the ability to gather in-person, we acted swiftly to implement cost savings and access capital to strengthen our financial position in response to the pandemic, and we shifted our strategy to focus on our self-service creator experience and support for virtual events. In 2021, we recentered on powering in-person events as restrictions eased in many regions, and our paid ticket volume for in-person events increased by 53% over 2020. Although the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have on our business is highly uncertain, we believe the human need to connect and feel part of a community, to share ideas, entertain and learn remains as strong as ever. For more than a decade, Eventbrite has been there, meeting this core need and sparking human connection in nearly 180 countries.
The Eventbrite platform was built as a self-service platform to make it possible for anyone to create and sell tickets to live experiences. Creators—the people who bring others together to share their passions, artistry and causes through live experiences—are our North Star, and we have built, and continue to build, our platform to provide them with an intuitive, secure and reliable way to plan and execute their live and online events and scale their operations. We have a creator-aligned business model: we succeed when our creators succeed. We allow hosts of free events to use our platform for free, and we charge creators of paid events on a per-ticket basis when an attendee purchases a paid ticket for an event. Our self-service platform gives creators control and speed, makes it easier to host and market events, and ultimately helps them sell more tickets and scale their businesses. 
Over the last 18 months, the human need to gather together and the draw of live experiences have remained strong, and our creators are leaning in to serve eager audiences. Eventbrite has demonstrated its understanding of creators and its ability to execute for them throughout this period, and we too are driving forward with excitement. We believe that by maintaining our sharp focus on anticipating and serving the needs of creators of live experiences, we can enable greater success for more creators and deliver sustainable growth and improved profitability for years to come.
In 2021, more than 660,000 creators held over five million free and paid events using Eventbrite, issuing nearly 291 million tickets to consumers on our global platform. 
Our Opportunity 
We have positioned ourselves as a leader specializing in mid-market experiences—the millions of events globally that fall between stadium-scale events and small personal gatherings. Prior to coming to Eventbrite, many event creators used ad hoc solutions, including spreadsheets and pen and paper, to transact tickets, manage payments, and market their events to attendees. We believe we uniquely solve these needs, particularly the specific needs of creators of frequently occurring events, and enable them to bring their passions to their audiences and build thriving businesses. 
In May 2021, we introduced Eventbrite Boost to help creators find and grow their audiences. We believe our view into attributes like ticket-buying behavior, audience engagement, and advertising effectiveness can make a meaningful positive impact on ticket sales for creators who use Eventbrite’s marketing tools. Over time, we plan to further make Boost and other marketing capabilities key features of the core Eventbrite experience, which we believe will increase creator engagement as well as ticketing volume on our platform.
Our Growth Strategy
While Eventbrite has and will continue to open its arms to event creators who want the control and speed that our self-service platform offers, frequent creators are at the center of our strategy. Frequent creators typically host live (virtual and/or in-person) events multiple times per quarter. They excel at community-building, constantly evolve to meet the demands of their audiences, work in small and agile teams, and aim to make a career out of their events-based offering.
Before coming to Eventbrite, many frequent creators operate by cobbling together a handful of disparate services and vendors to sustain their events-based businesses. Our strategy is to solve their specific needs through a holistic self-service 
solution that builds their confidence, enables them to reach new audiences and grow their business. By using our tools to efficiently and intuitively address their ticketing and marketing needs, frequent creators can free their time to concentrate on running successful events that deliver fresh and compelling content, reach wider audiences, and cultivate happy customers who plan to come back. Eventbrite therefore becomes an essential tool that helps frequent creators both express their skills and build their community.
The key elements of our growth strategy are:
Build Creator Confidence. We strive to build a product experience and brand that will delight our frequent creators and help give them the confidence to hold more events and achieve their business goals, thereby driving our own success and revenue. We plan to continue building tools that will enable creators to expand their reach and engagement, as we refine our platform to make it even more intuitive and easy-to-use, particularly for creating and managing multiple events. Our industry insights and reinforcement of creators’ success are designed to give creators confidence to hold another event.
Leverage our Scale. The market for event management solutions remains highly fragmented, and we intend to use our scale to provide a differentiated experience for our creators and consumers. We plan to continue to invest in search engine optimization and authoritative content to reinforce the prominence of our destination and the visibility of our event listings—both of which are key competitive advantages. We also plan to provide creators with actionable insights from creator and consumer data, and engage our millions of consumers through an impactful, memorable product experience.
Win Consumer Trust. We believe that by earning consumer trust we will be able to provide our event creators with a larger, more engaged audience, thereby driving our own success and revenue. We plan to enhance our search and discovery capabilities to enable consumers to more easily find events that are high quality and relevant to them. Further, we intend to use our data capabilities to provide reliable and relevant recommendations to consumers to drive reach and engagement. We also plan to build buyer confidence by increasing confidence in the event creators they are buying from.
We believe that these three elements will help set us apart from our competitors. As we better attract and retain frequent creators, they will create more events on the Eventbrite platform. More events will lead to more consumers on the Eventbrite platform. Greater scale allows us to provide smarter insights and tools for creators and consumers alike. And by providing more and more value to both creators and consumers, we believe we can become the most trusted-and most used-platform for events.
Our Strategy for Adapting to COVID-19
The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative and protective actions that governments, other third parties or we have taken or may in the future take in respect of COVID-19, including government lockdowns and quarantine measures, have resulted, and will continue to result, in global economic and business disruption, including disruption to our business. In 2020, we acted swiftly to implement cost savings and access capital to strengthen our financial position in response to the pandemic, and we shifted our strategy to focus on our self-service creator experience and support for virtual events. In 2021, we continued to closely manage our expenses, and invested in product enhancements to help overall usability for both frequent and single-event creators while increasing the breadth of capabilities on our platform. To execute on this strategy, we ramped up our engineering hiring in 2021 and intend to establish a talent hub in India in 2022. We recognize that the near-term recovery may not be linear, particularly in light of recent information related to new variants of the virus, however we believe that our sharpened focus and product-first orientation will drive strong growth as our product solutions expand and our volumes scale in the future. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in nature and significant uncertainty remains regarding the extent and duration of the impact on our business. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be predicted at this time, the impact of COVID-19 may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced which may result in a reduction in paid ticket volume and an increase in event cancellation losses.
Our Platform
We leverage technology to connect event creators and attendees through live experiences. Our platform consists of the Eventbrite Platform, our event creators and our technology.
The Eventbrite Platform
Eventbrite was founded with a creator-first ethos, and our deep connection to creator communities around the world has helped us to anticipate their needs across the lifecycle of their events. From marketing and ticketing to event analytics, we built our self-service solution by listening to our creators.
We designed our platform to produce consistent and reliable performance and to handle surges in traffic and transaction volume associated with high-demand on-sales and support millions of events each year. We are continuing to strengthen our platform infrastructure as we shift from a monolithic architecture to one based on microservices. We believe the microservices infrastructure we are building will improve our platform's overall velocity, scalability and availability and ultimately benefit our event creators. This approach gives creators a platform that can scale to their needs, offering everything from basic registration and ticketing to a fully-featured event management platform.
We offer pricing packages in order to be able to meet the varying needs of creators who come to our platform. We offer three different pricing packages for ticketing services, and with the launch of Boost, we also offer three different paid monthly subscriptions for marketing services, each with corresponding levels of features to provide flexibility for each creator. Annual Boost subscriptions are available at each level for a discounted rate. To help drive the growth of our business, we have periodically adjusted the pricing and components of our packages.
Our Event Creators
Event creators are the heart and soul of Eventbrite, and we build our platform with them in mind. Eventbrite creators are predominantly small teams, composed of 10 or fewer people. Most find their way to Eventbrite by keyword search, on the recommendation of other creators, or through their own Eventbrite experiences as attendees. Prior to coming to Eventbrite, many of our creators used ad hoc solutions, including generic email and spreadsheet programs, to track attendees and ticket sales.
While any event creator can host self-service events on our platform, our frequent creators are the key target for our business. These creative entrepreneurs tend to have a passion or a skill that they express through events, events tend to be the center of their business and they excel at community-building, especially online.
Built for Self-Service
Our self-service approach has allowed us to pioneer a powerful business model that drives our go-to-market strategy and allows us to efficiently serve a large number and variety of creators. It also enabled us to reposition our strategy during COVID-19 to continue building the best product for our creators while effectively managing our operational expenses. Historically, we derived approximately half our revenue from creators who signed themselves up to use our platform and approximately half our revenue from creators acquired through our sales channels, many of whom expected significant customer support. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to refocus our strategy on acquiring and retaining creators who use our platform with minimal training, support or professional services, rather than creators who require significant on-site services and customer support.
Third-Party Developers 
Our technology infrastructure facilitates product development and allows third-party developers to integrate features and functionality from Eventbrite into their environment. Our platform also allows developers to seamlessly integrate services from third-party partners. The Eventbrite App Store makes it easy for creators to find and install these solutions to help them market their events, engage with their audience, increase their productivity and track analytics.
Human Capital 
Eventbrite is committed to bringing the world together through live experiences, and we like to think about working at Eventbrite as the ultimate live experience. In order to continue building on our innovative self-service ticketing and experience technology platform, it is important that we attract, engage and retain talented employees. We have made great strides in strengthening our employee experience as illustrated by a 20 point increase in engagement over the last year. We attribute this gain to our rigorous focus on setting and delivering our company strategy, compensation and performance management, and empowering our Britelings to learn and grow. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program tailored to our employees' needs across our global locations. We also provide meaningful perks, work to foster a diverse and inclusive culture and connect our employees with opportunities to make an impact in their communities.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 707 employees, of which 398 were in the United States and 309 were outside the United States. 
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to drive our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, cash bonuses, and long-term incentives in the form of stock. We believe that a competitive compensation program with both short-term and long-term award opportunities tied to the achievement of meaningful performance metrics, allows us to align employees with stockholders interests. In addition to our compensation programs, we focus on promoting the total wellness of our people through resources, services and programs that support the physical, mental, and financial health of our Britelings and their families. We offer a wide range of benefits, such as comprehensive health insurance, access to certified coaches and therapists, paid time off, paid parental leave, retirement plans and a wide variety of perks and stipends. We further support Britelings' wellness through our BriteBreak program, which was established in 2020 to increase productivity, mitigate burnout, and drive increased engagement and retention with designated days off once per month. We enhanced a number of these benefits to support our employees through the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including payments to assist with work from home costs.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We believe that progress as a society and as a company comes from proactively fostering diversity, equity and inclusion with tangible, evidence-based practices that we believe are key to attracting and retaining top talent. We are committed to hiring and retaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive team through initiatives that will ensure we are considering a diverse slate of candidates for all mid-level and higher positions and conducting audits to ensure pay equity. We are also focused on supporting Britelings across the full employee lifecycle and have implemented programs and practices designed to promote inclusion and diversity, employee engagement and employee wellness. For example, to foster an increased sense of inclusion at Eventbrite, we are committed to hosting ongoing workshops, conversations, exercises and training to explore how we can create change in our roles to foster more diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also support employee “BriteBelonging'' groups, an important component of our culture, which help to build an inclusive culture through company events and education, networking and mentorship opportunities, participation in our recruitment efforts, and input into our hiring strategies. Further, we are using our platform and marketing channels to amplify creators that promote racial and social justice, equality, equity and civic action. To strengthen the communities we work and live in we advocated for national policies that promote gender and racial equity including paid family and medical leave and advancing voting rights in the United States. 
Social Impact 
In 2021, we continued our efforts to help creators re-connect with their communities and navigate the return of their in-person events. We lobbied and advocated on behalf of the event community impacted by COVID-19 and supported our creators in accessing federal funding available to them, empowered event creators to prioritize safety when hosting in-person events with our COVID-19 Safety Playbook for Events, and enabled over 1.8 million vaccine registrations across 23 countries and 46 U.S. states. We launched Eventbrite Advocacy to engage our creators in policy advocacy, allowing the scale of our creator community to drive positive change meaningful to them, and small businesses generally. Through our Community Engagement Time Off program, our full-time global employees are offered paid time off to expand their understanding, advocacy and engagement with their communities. We supported employees in this effort by offering opportunities to contribute to voter registration, global map-making to support disaster relief, and resume building support for young people.
While helping our creators re-build their businesses and event attendee communities, and also supporting our employees through their own COVID-related life experiences, we have become even more aware of the importance of Eventbrite’s mission to bring the world together. Social isolation was a global health concern long before our 2020 lockdowns, and the pandemic has only exacerbated the physical and mental downstream effects from lack of connection. In 2022, we plan to take our mission further by amplifying the power that connection, especially through live experiences, has to relieve social isolation. Our Social Connection program seeks to raise awareness about social isolation and reduce its stigma, support creators in hosting more socially connected events, and use our lobbying infrastructure to elevate social isolation as a public health priority. We believe our commitment to address the physical and mental health effects of social isolation will help alleviate suffering from social isolation, while enhancing our efforts to attract and retain high performing employees, strengthening our trust with creators and consumers, and allowing us to engage with our customers in new ways.
Competition
The market for event management solutions is highly fragmented and is impacted by shifting creator and attendee needs and changing technology and consumer trends. We also compete with internally-developed systems. This competitive landscape provides creators and attendees with many channels to promote or engage with live experiences.
We believe that our competitors fall into four broad groups: internally-developed ad hoc systems that creators cobble together on their own; event management software vendors, who are typically dedicated to a particular category of events in a limited number of countries; smaller niche or regional providers, who are typically smaller in scale and have limited technology and feature functionality; and more recently, large technology companies who have added products in the online events space and whose user-bases have substantial event-related activity, such as Facebook, Spotify and Zoom. 
With respect to each of these competitor types, we seek to differentiate ourselves by being an event technology platform first and foremost, continuing to build a self-service product that will delight event creators, leveraging our scale and helping to build larger, more engaged audiences for our event creators.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technology, is an important factor in the success of our business. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents laws, in the U.S. and abroad. We also use contractual provisions and restrictions governing access to our proprietary technology, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, and companies with which we conduct business. As of December 31, 2021, we had 13 issued patents, which expire between 2031 and 2032, and one patent application pending in the United States. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology.
Government Regulations
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, ticketing, payments, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
