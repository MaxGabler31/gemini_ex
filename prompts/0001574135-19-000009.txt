ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We provide a leading cloud‑native platform that makes software development and IT operations a strategic advantage for our customers. Our cloud‑native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (“PCF”), accelerates and streamlines software development by reducing the complexity of building, deploying and operating new cloud‑native applications and modernizing legacy applications. This enables our customers’ development and IT operations teams to spend more time writing code, waste less time on mundane tasks and focus on activities that drive business value – building and deploying great software. PCF customers can accelerate their adoption of a modern software development process and their business success using our platform through our complementary strategic services, Pivotal Labs (“Labs”). Enterprises across industries have adopted our platform to build, deploy and operate software, including enterprises in the automotive and transportation, industrial and business services, financial services, healthcare and insurance, technology and media, consumer and communications and government sectors.
Cloud-native software is reshaping businesses across all industries, empowering enterprises to innovate at a higher velocity and become more digital, mobile, data-driven and always-connected. Cloud-native software is designed to be highly available, scalable and modular to allow for frequent iteration and feature releases. Despite the widespread availability of private and public cloud infrastructure, many organizations are burdened by legacy technologies and software development processes that prevent them from fully realizing the benefits of cloud-native software. As a result, organizations require a modern agile development process and a cloud-native platform that can be deployed on every major private and public cloud.
Our offering, which includes PCF and Labs, enables organizations to build cloud‑native software and compete in today’s business environment.
•PCF accelerates and streamlines software development by reducing the complexity of building, deploying and operating modern applications. PCF integrates an expansive set of critical, modern software technologies to provide a turnkey cloud‑native platform. PCF combines leading open‑source software with our robust proprietary software to meet the exacting enterprise‑grade requirements of large organizations, including the ability to operate and manage software across private and public cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VMware vSphere and OpenStack. PCF is sold on a subscription basis.
•Labs software development experts deliver strategic services that transfer the expertise for enterprises to accelerate their cloud‑native transformation by implementing modern agile development practices. With Labs, we help customers co‑develop new applications and transform existing ones while accelerating software development, streamlining IT operations and ultimately driving self‑sustaining business transformation.
We market and sell PCF and Labs through our sales force and ecosystem partners. We leverage our mutually beneficial commercial and go-to-market relationships with Dell Technologies (“Dell”) and VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) to win new customers and to expand our customer footprint. We also work closely with large public cloud providers, including Google and Microsoft, to bring our customers’ workloads to their cloud infrastructure. We have received numerous industry awards, including the Microsoft Azure US consumption 2018 partner of the year award, the Solstice 2018 Partner of the Year award, the Apigee 2018 Partner of the Year award; and Pivotal Container Service (“PKS”) won CRN’s 2018 Tech Innovator award for container technology.
We intend to prioritize the growth of PCF, while leveraging our strategic services and increasingly relying on global systems integrators ("SI") and boutique consulting firms that are building focused practices around Pivotal technology implementation, application migration and cloud-native development. These enterprise technology providers include Accenture and the Accenture Pivotal Business Group, Capgemini, CGI, Cognizant, DXC, HCL, NTT-Data, Perficient, Solstice, and Wipro.
We are focused on subscription sales of our platform. Since announcing PCF in November 2013, our subscription customer count has grown to 377 as of the end of fiscal 2019. Our customers often start with smaller PCF deployments in specific groups or departments and then expand their subscriptions as they seek to deploy and manage more applications and other workloads. At the end of fiscal 2019, our trailing four-quarter dollar-based net expansion rate was 149%. 
Our subscription revenue was $400.9 million, $259.0 million and $150.0 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 55% for fiscal 2019 and 73% for fiscal 2018. Our total revenue was $657.5 million, $509.4 million and $416.3 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 29% for fiscal 2019 and 22% for fiscal 2018. We expect that over time subscription revenue will continue to become a larger percentage of our total revenue as customers continue to adopt PCF and as our SI partner ecosystem ramps to deliver strategic services directly to our customers. Our GAAP net losses were $141.9 million, $163.5 million and $232.9 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.

Pivotal Cloud Foundry
PCF is a cloud-native platform that provides a consistent way to launch, and quickly iterate on, applications in the most popular programming languages (such as Java, .Net, Ruby, Python, Node.js and Go) and frameworks (such as Spring) across private, public and multi-cloud environments. PCF leverages Cloud Foundry open-source software and adds enterprise-grade qualifications and capabilities such as platform enhancements, infrastructure automation, application enablement, cloud-native enablement, security and enterprise support. The critical platform components of PCF include: a multi-cloud orchestration foundation, an embedded operating system, a central security and credential framework, a built-in advanced container networking and security engine, a robust and scalable application middleware environment and leading application and data microservices technologies. 
Pivotal Cloud Foundry Architecture
The components of PCF include:
Products to handle customers’ differing workloads and needs.

- | Pivotal Application Service. Pivotal Application Service ("PAS") is our flagship cloud-native application platform that allows enterprises to continuously deploy and operate custom software securely and at scale across popular private and public clouds. Many enterprises have adopted PAS as their multi-cloud platform for new and existing applications. PAS is built for secure and continuous deployment of applications built using microservices. 


- | Pivotal Container Service. Pivotal Container Service ("PKS") is our container management platform that we co-developed with Google and VMware, which leverages core infrastructure components from PCF. PKS allows enterprises to deploy and operate Kubernetes, an open-source system for container orchestration, in an enterprise-grade manner across private and public clouds. Containers package and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment - they contain all of the files necessary to run on their own. PKS includes VMware NSX to programmatically manage software defined networking and is also integrated with VMware tools such as VMware vRealize Operations, VMware vSAN and Wavefront by VMware. 


- | Pivotal Function Service. Pivotal Function Service ("PFS") is a Function-as-a-Service ("FaaS") platform designed to run on Kubernetes. PFS is based on Riff, a Pivotal-sponsored open source project, and Knative, a Google-sponsored open source project. PFS is designed to allow enterprises to develop, run and manage applications composed of functions across private and public clouds. FaaS platforms allow developers to write only the function logic necessary to accomplish a given task while the platform provides all of the other necessary runtime capabilities. We believe that FaaS will become a common requirement of customer applications as event-driven systems gain popularity. 


- | Pivotal Services Marketplace. Our Marketplace provides customers access to Pivotal and partner products that deploy and operate on PCF. These services include MySQL, Pivotal Cloud Cache, Concourse and RabbitMQ. Additionally, ISV partner products have been integrated with our platform to leverage certain of our common services and core technologies on PCF. 

•Common Platform Services. For each of our products above, PCF has common services that support operational efficiency, developer productivity, security and availability, which enable us to efficiently add PCF products and enable our customers to better make use of our platform and products.
•BOSH. BOSH is open-source orchestration software that provides an integrated set of foundational services and core technologies for deploying and operating PCF. BOSH enables operators to build and manage environments for large and complex IT systems. BOSH unifies release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software, with the ability to provision and deploy software across hundreds of virtual machines on both private and public cloud environments. It is designed to perform monitoring, failure recovery and software updates without downtime and integrates a hardened operating system. 
•Multi-Cloud. PCF supports all of the major private and public cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack and VMware vSphere. We collaborate with these cloud providers to maintain tight integration to the infrastructure layer. We automate the underlying cloud infrastructure of a PCF deployment, thereby reducing the operator burden to build and maintain their clouds and the need for developers to focus on the underlying infrastructure.
•Other Data Products. We also offer other data products, such as Pivotal Gemfire, Pivotal Greenplum and Pivotal Postgres. To make building data driven applications easy for our customers, our strategy is to continue developing integrations, including between Pivotal Greenplum and PCF, while also working to modernize Pivotal Greenplum to make it easier to deploy and operate on any cloud.
Pivotal Labs
Labs offers strategic services for organizations to adopt and implement agile development and to transform existing applications to run on PCF. Labs has been pioneering and refining agile development processes for over 25 years. With Labs’ disciplined and agile processes, software is developed collaboratively, with cross-functional teams who break down projects into discrete tasks and work iteratively within an environment of changing requirements. Rather than deploying periodic and major releases, software is deployed frequently, which allows for continuous feedback as the product takes shape. Our approach also involves pair-programming, in which Labs experts are paired with customer engineers. Each pair works in close collaboration, sometimes using a single keyboard, to write code together.
Labs also applies an operational practice known as "DevOps." Embracing these agile processes can be challenging for many organizations whose cultures have ingrained waterfall development methodologies, separate "dev," "ops" and other organizational silos and are generally resistant to change. We implement a structured approach designed to break through these silos and imprint Labs’ disciplines with our customers and with our partners. We use Labs development methodologies to enable our customers to create new applications and re-platform legacy applications to the PCF platform. Our objective is to teach our customers Labs’ agile processes so that they can become self-sufficient and transform how they build software.
Implementation and Other Services
We also offer platform implementation services to enable our customers and partners to deploy, provision and operate the PCF platform at scale. We deliver product support and other services to assist our customers in meeting their business goals with our software. Premium support services are delivered by our global support organization. These services are offered during the term of the subscription, or maintenance term for certain legacy software products, and include: unlimited and responsive phone, web and email based issue, or ticket, support; unspecified product updates and upgrades; and online access to documentation, technical resources, knowledge base and discussion forums.
Additionally, we offer training to strategic partners so they can provide Labs-like services, driving increased leverage in our business model. We also offer a range of standard and customized internet and in-person courses to educate end users, operators and partners to upgrade their Pivotal product knowledge and capabilities.
Our Customers
As of February 1, 2019, we had 377 subscription customers on our platform with annual revenue of $50,000 or greater, including companies in the Global 2000 and Fortune 500. Our global customer base spans multiple industry verticals such as financial services, healthcare, transportation, technology, media, communications, and consumer. We also have customers in the government sector and consider it an important and growing segment for new and expansion sales. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales efforts are centered on landing and expanding PCF subscriptions. Frequently, an organization will subscribe to PCF for near‑term consumption needs for a single division or small set of applications and then subsequently expand its subscription capacity and deployment to other divisions or a broader set of applications across the organization.
We primarily sell PCF through our sales force, which is comprised of enterprise sales representatives who team with platform architects, or technical sales engineers, and supporting business operations personnel. Our account teams are organized primarily by geographic coverage with some specialization for various industries.
Our sales efforts target the C‑suite, technology professionals, software developers and data scientists. In addition to our sales force, we rely on partners, including our strategic partners Dell and VMware, public cloud vendors and SIs, to increase our sales and distribution of our technology and services. In addition, we have ISV partners whose integrations enable enterprises to receive additional benefits of our platform. Our principal marketing programs include: webinars, user conferences (such as the SpringOne Platform conference and Cloud Foundry Foundation Summits in North America and Europe) and cooperative marketing efforts with partners. We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and through our ecosystem partners.
Research and Development
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new technologies, features and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our offerings. We focus our efforts on developing our core technologies and further enhancing their usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility. We also apply the Labs process to our development of PCF, resulting in ongoing, rapid and prioritized feature development.
Open-Source Initiatives
Pivotal supports open-source projects and communities for collaborative innovation such as: Cloud Foundry, Spring, Kubernetes, Knative, Istio, Apache Geode, Greenplum Database, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Concourse, Apache MADlib, Apache Tomcat, Redis, and various others. 
Cloud Foundry Foundation
In December 2014, we established the Cloud Foundry Foundation, an independent nonprofit, open-source project. The Cloud Foundry Foundation now has more than 64 members comprised of leading technology providers and global enterprises. The Cloud Foundry Foundation develops and maintains a number of programs and work groups designed to help advance awareness and adoption of the Cloud Foundry platform. Cloud Foundry is an open-source, cloud-agnostic application deployment platform. We believe that the Cloud Foundry Foundation helps promote Cloud Foundry as a leading Platform-as-a-Service ("PaaS") open-source technology with an expansive ecosystem. 
Spring
Spring is the leading open-source framework for developers building modern Java applications and microservices. Millions of developers use Spring regularly. Spring simplifies complexities of application development so that developers can focus on building features and business value. Spring Boot is an extension of Spring designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of cloud-native applications and is particularly popular for building microservices. The Spring Boot framework applies an opinionated approach to configuration, eliminating the need to define or implement boilerplate configuration before starting to build an application. Spring Cloud, built on top of Spring Boot and Netflix Open Source, provides components that enable common patterns in microservices application architectures, such as distributed configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing and micro-proxy. Using Spring Cloud, developers can quickly build and deploy a complex application that is highly available, resilient to failure and easily configured. PCF includes Spring Cloud as an integrated component of PAS, making it simpler for developers to deliver microservice applications on the platform.
Competition
The markets within which we operate are highly competitive. A significant number of companies and open-source projects have developed or are developing products and services that currently, or in the future may, compete with some or all of our offerings. In addition, in some instances we have strategic or other commercial relationships with companies with which we currently or may in the future compete. We face competition from:

• | legacy application infrastructure and middleware from vendors such as IBM and Oracle;


• | open-source based offerings supported by vendors such as Red Hat (which has agreed to be acquired by IBM); alternative Cloud Foundry-based offerings such as IBM Cloud and SAP Cloud Platform, which have proprietary features that are unique to their offerings; or potential customers’ internally-developed, integrated and maintained efforts; and


• | proprietary public cloud offerings from vendors such as Amazon Web Services (including its on-premise cloud offerings), Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.

Backlog
We define backlog to consist of future amounts that have not been invoiced under our agreements and amounts that have been invoiced and reflected as deferred revenue on our consolidated financial statements. As of February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018, we had backlog of approximately $990 million and $820 million, respectively. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of the February 1, 2019 backlog as subscription or services revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer subscription and services agreements, varying invoice cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals.
Seasonality
We have seasonal end-of-quarter and end-of-fiscal-year concentration of our sales. Our sales vary by season with the fourth quarter typically being our strongest sales quarter, and the first quarter typically being our largest collections quarter. In addition, within each quarter, most sales occur in the last month of that quarter. 
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, we contribute code to, and our platform incorporates, open source licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache 2.0 Software License. Such licenses can grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute contributed code. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of certain of our intellectual property assets.
As of February 1, 2019, we had been granted or had acquired 139 U.S. patents and had 73 U.S. patent applications pending. We also had 34 issued patents and 39 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents expire between 2023 and 2037. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We also pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks and copyrights in our software in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. Our employees, consultants and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use.
Employees
As of February 1, 2019, we had 2,949 full time employees. Of these employees, 1,988 were in the United States, and 961 were in our international locations. We also engage contractors and consultants.
