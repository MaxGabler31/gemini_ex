POWER SUPPLY INDUSTRY
 Background
 
The power supply industry is comprised of a few large suppliers and a vast number of smaller companies that focus on specialized products and markets.  Currently, the power solutions market for our N2Power brand products include the Servers, Storage and Network (“SSN”), Industrial and Transportation (“IND”), Network Power Systems (“NPS”), Medical, Gaming and LED/Lighting markets.
 
We believe the following key trends will continue to drive demand for our power solutions products:
 

● | Increasing amounts of power required by the communications infrastructure industry. The proliferation of data centers and their related infrastructures, the internet, wireless communications, broadband applications, server and storage farms and other new technologies have increased exponentially the amount of information transmitted. As a result, the push for higher bandwidth and more efficient and effective power solutions has been driving a faster replacement cycle for telecommunications equipment as well as strong infrastructure expansion. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing demand for high conversion efficiencies, high power density and digital power management. Efforts in the EU, the United States and Asia to reduce energy consumption are increasing the demand for high conversion efficiencies and digital power control. In addition, groups such as the Climate Savers Computing Initiative, consisting of a consortium of companies including Google and Intel and other eco-conscious businesses and conservation organizations are promoting the development, deployment and adoption of smart technologies that can both improve the efficiency of a computer’s power utilization and reduce the energy consumed when the computer is in an inactive state. Because a large portion of electrical energy waste occurs during the power conversion process, power companies have an opportunity to improve the conversion efficiency to reduce the operating costs for the end user. Our AC/DC power supplies provide conversion efficiency ratings up to 93%. Our digital power control technologies allow us to achieve high levels of power conversion efficiency and control that are not possible with analog designs. Higher conversion efficiencies help reduce overall power usage and therefore cut greenhouse gas emissions and total cost of infrastructure ownership.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to increase volume with our current OEM customers. Our OEM customers are constantly changing their products and introducing new products. We are striving to become the supplier of choice within our OEM customer base to leverage our existing relationships and drive volume growth within the same sales channel. 
● | Continue to expand our footprint in the current markets we serve. We are currently supporting the data center equipment, medical, gaming, test equipment, transportation, industrial and telecommunications systems markets. We have secured several sizable OEM customers and are aiming to add new OEM customers in these markets. 
● | Expand our product line while continuing to drive for higher power levels and greater conversion efficiencies in a smaller footprint. Minimizing space requirements within our customers’ products is critical, and as a result there is a continuing need for smaller packaging while delivering additional power. Our product roadmap addresses these needs and our objective is to lead the industry with the greatest efficiency in the smallest footprint with the highest power available. In this way, we can deliver advantages to our OEM customers as they leverage our technology in their product designs. 
● | Expand our product line through private label offerings. We have identified a need for utilizing other manufacturers’ core products to complement our own, where we lack products in specific markets or power levels. To achieve this, we will utilize our relationships with other power solutions manufacturers. 
● | Organize our technology resources for fast time to market on derivative products. Our customers continually request derivative configurations to our existing products. In order to serve this market effectively, we are organizing our engineering resources for fast turnaround on these designs to shorten our OEM customers’ design cycle, leading to faster time to market.

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLIERS
 
We perform product assembly, integration and testing for our storage products at our factory in Simi Valley, California. Our private label storage products are manufactured in various geographical locations by a select group of suppliers. Our N2Power branded products are manufactured in China at specifically qualified contract manufacturers.  We purchase tape drives, chassis, printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, and all other major components from outside suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components which meet technical specifications and volume requirements. We actively monitor these suppliers but we are subject to substantial risks associated with the performance of our suppliers. For certain components, we qualify a single source, which magnifies the risk of shortages and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier. See "If our suppliers fail to meet our component and manufacturing needs, it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations" under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I, Section 1A of this report. 
COMPETITION

The worldwide storage market is highly competitive. Competitors vary in size from small start-ups to large multi-national corporations which may have substantially greater financial, engineering and marketing resources than us. In the tape automation market, we believe our primary competitors are International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Oracle/StorageTek, Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard, Overland Storage, Spectra Logic and Quantum Corporation. Key competitive factors include product features, reliability, durability, scalability and price. Barriers to entry in tape automation are relatively high as this is an established industry that is capital intensive.
 
Our primary power supply competitors are Artesyn, TDK Lambda, XP Power and Bel Power. Key competitive factors in these markets include price, performance, functionality, availability, interoperability, connectivity, time to market, enhancements and total value of ownership. Barriers to entry for power supply products are high as the industry is capital intensive. 
 
The markets for all of our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate that our products will continue to face substantial pricing pressure.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, competition in our businesses is significant. We believe that, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the tape storage and power supply industries, patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as market responsiveness, knowledge, ability and the experience of our personnel as well as timely new product introductions. 
 
We enter into Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreements with all employees and consultants to protect our technology and designs.
