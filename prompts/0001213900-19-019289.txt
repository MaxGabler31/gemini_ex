Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a development stage artificial intelligence software company targeting the college course market. We are creating a cloud-based platform for college and university courses to be delivered to learners online and in hybrid online / on campus formats. We plan to use machine learning to provide a novel, mass customized experience to learners. Our intended customers are universities and colleges, and we are passionate about improving the learner experience and learner outcomes in college courses, and improving colleges’ ability to create and deliver both.
Our Strategy
 
We will work closely with our customers to deliver college courses, and share the revenue that our customers receive from learners. We will convert customer content onto our proprietary platform, and use the proprietary data we collect on learner behavior and responses with their consent, to deliver to learners engaging, effective college courses. We aim to reduce college operating costs, and improve learner experience and performance. Customers will generate content, admit and enroll learners, approve of assessments, grading and engagement techniques, and deliver grades and credits to learners. Courses will be branded according to customer norms, and will be marketed collaboratively, as customer products.
Our Proprietary Technology
 
Large, lecture-based college courses offer the opportunity to collect substantial datasets impractical for instructors to collect, but highly relevant to individuals’ learning experience and outcomes. College instructors are unable to customize delivery of information based on learners’ habits, given their present inability to collect and analyze learners’ data. We plan to implement machine learning algorithms to enable mass customized learning in higher education, freeing instructors from routine analysis and enabling delivery of information only possible with specific data on behaviors and preferences of individual learners. Much as artificial intelligence algorithms presently recognize, and respond to natural language on commercial platforms, predict behaviors and deliver suggestions, our algorithms will assist learners in accessing, utilizing and remaining engaged with course material.
 
Learner data will be collected with learner permission, and information about learner behavior, study preferences and preference for types of material delivered as part of college courses, will be used to improve learning outcomes and learner experiences. We will validate algorithms using both offline and online testing.
 
By correlating learner behaviors with specific outcomes as identified by qualified instructors, we will train our algorithms specifically for important college course outcomes, enabling it to be a useful tool for instructors. We believe that the combinations of information that will be collected through our educational products, and outcomes measured using our online learning products will be unique, and constantly improved.
 
We will never sell or distribute our learner data to third parties without the explicit permission of learners. We will not deliver unwanted content or advertising to learners or to customer personnel. Our proprietary technology is developed solely for purposes of improving learner experiences and outcomes, and improving the ability of college and university instructors and other staff to deliver outstanding educational products.

We are committed to protecting the data we collect. Towards this end, we plan to utilize blockchain technology in our online platform. The blockchain is an electronic ledger created by a decentralized, distributed computing network that is highly resistant to modification of data. As such, the technology has been used to create cryptocurrencies, with the intention of creating durable, tradeable and stateless assets. While frequently associated with cryptocurrencies, the blockchain technology has other applications, including being used to encode and then enable readout of data for business purposes. The blockchain is presently considered to be among the more secure methods to encode data, and thus offers a means to store important data which can be publicly read out, without modification of the data set. We intend to utilize the blockchain as a bookkeeping device to store information about learner credentials. Presently, most universities and colleges in the United States individually manage applications, enrollment, and graduation or the issuance of non-degree credentials, such as certificates. Transcripts and other records from institutions are issued to students or former students, or sent directly to other institutions, workplaces, employment agencies, or the government. We believe that a blockchained database for higher education could deliver efficiencies to both learners and institutions. We will face certain risks and challenges in implementing the blockchain, including, but not limited to:
 

● | the risk of inability to encode data properly;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | the risk that institutions will be reluctant or unwilling to embrace the technology and recognize encoded data; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the encoding of data in the blockchain will prove unwieldy and therefore less preferred than traditional methods; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | uncertainty in determining how fast an innovative technology will be accepted by the target market, if at all; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the development of blockchain technology could be stifled or otherwise adversely impacted by regulatory uncertainty.

Key Differences Between Public and Private Blockchain Solutions
 
Public Blockchain
 
The major distinction between public and private blockchain is related to who is allowed to participate in the network, execute the consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. A public blockchain network is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network. The network typically has an incentivizing mechanism to encourage more participants to join the network.
 
One of the drawbacks of a public blockchain is the substantial amount of computational power that is necessary to maintain a distributed ledger at a large scale. More specifically, to achieve consensus, each node in a network must solve a complex, resource-intensive cryptographic problem called a proof of work to ensure all are in sync.
 
Public blockchains are designed to be standalone, in the sense that they eliminate the need for intermediaries in exchanges of assets. Because they have to be multiply redundant, they can be slower and costlier to operate, but are generally regarded as more secure for the same reason of redundancy. Public blockchain solutions are most appropriate for decentralized applications similar to how we plan to use blockchain in our business.
 
Private Blockchain
 
Private blockchains use permissioned nodes that must be validated by either the starter of the network or a set of rules put in place by the starter. Businesses which set up private blockchains, generally set up a permissioned network. This restricts access to the network for certain transactions. Unlike a public blockchain network which is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network, participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join a private blockchain network. The access control mechanism may vary such that: existing participants could decide future entrants, a regulatory authority could issue licenses for participation, or a consortium could make the decisions. Once an entity has joined the network, it will play a role in maintaining the blockchain in a decentralized manner. Private blockchains are typically faster and less expensive to maintain and manage than public blockchains.
 
One of the drawbacks of a private blockchain is only certain members have access within the blockchain. This is useful if there’s no need for anybody outside of the blockchain to become part of the chain, However, we anticipate needing multiple users in the university setting to have access to transcript data which is one of the potential disadvantages of using a private blockchain solution in our business.

Although we are still in the process of determining whether to utilize private or public blockchain solutions provided by third parties in the context of our business we believe that a public blockchain solution might be the most appropriate for our business even though public blockchain solutions are typically slower and more expensive than private blockchain solutions for the following reasons:
 

● | Given the cutting edge nature of the blockchain industry it is difficult to find blockchain professionals to develop private blockchain solutions given the relatively small talent pool and the general “renegade” nature of the field; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe that there are a sufficient number of qualified contractors we can use, with little/no risk (learners can always pull a transcript as they would traditionally, from the registrar or transcript office of their university) because in the case of problems such as data breaches, we feel that the way those would be handled (routinely) by big contractors is sufficient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Internally, we have not begun work to design or develop blockchain technology; our invention is in the area of utilization of the tool to record transactions in academia in the public ledger. It is our intention to innovate in the area of use of publicly-validated tools in the conduct of our business, rather than in creating specialized, private currencies. Given the small role blockchain will play in our overall business we don’t believe the costs associate with utilizing a public or private blockchain solution provided by a third party will have a material impact on our operations, revenues, if any or capital expenditures.
 
Our Research and Development Programs
 
We will use advanced technologies to create effective and accessible higher learning environments. We seek to improve the college experience by targeting the earliest, foundational, core courses that are required in order for learners to achieve college degrees. These courses form the building blocks for higher education learning and professional contribution. Our research and development programs will expand continuously based on learner preferences, outcomes and the desires of our customer colleges and universities. Some of these will include:

● | Improvements in learner engagement with cloud-based platforms. We will continuously gather data on how learners engage with us and other online platforms, and conduct research and development to create and incorporate useful tools for learning on our platform. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvements in instructor experience using our platform. We will continuously develop tools designed to improve the ability of our customers to deliver timely and relevant content, deliver assessments which are fair, correctly represent educational objectives and give repeatable outcomes when employed on our platform. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Algorithms for optimizing learning products for those pursuing college degrees. We will conduct research to improve the efficiency and robustness of our algorithms, employing mixed models to deliver validated tools. We will use our algorithms to deliver solutions for seeking courses, determining their transferability, and determining their applicability toward degrees. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Qualification of information for use by learners at the college level. We plan to provide both our customers and our learners with the constantly improving ability to find and integrate qualified information into products on our platform, and maximize learner ability to utilize qualified information, contextualized by structured college courses designed to offer learners the most carefully curated, most relevant, timely and engaging materials in every discipline in which we offer products.

Our Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property rights may include patent applications, trade secrets, trademark rights, and contractual agreements. Our patent applications are directed to our proprietary technology, including an artificial intelligence platform for learning, and will seek patent protection for our designs, development, and related alternatives by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate.
 
We currently have five pending U.S. patent applications, including one to cover the artificial intelligence platform, and others related to security, power consumption, blockchain, and other technologies, including methods and systems. Any patent issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038, not including any applicable patent term adjustment or extension.
 
We intend to also seek trade secret protection for our source codes, methodologies, algorithms, and techniques directed to other aspects of our artificial intelligence learning platform. We have filed an intent-to-use trademark for AMESITETM with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also secured domain names, including amesite.com, amesite.co, amesite.net, and others.
 
We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us or that assign any intellectual property rights to us. Portions of our platform may rely upon third-party licensed intellectual property.
 
We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and entities with which we conduct business.
 
Competition
 
The on-line and software industries for higher education are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, government regulation, and strong defense of intellectual property. The overall market for technology solutions that enable higher education providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of learners and educators and frequent introductions of new methods of delivering education online. While we believe that our platform, programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major on-line companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, among others.
 
Any course offering that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current course offerings. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other course offerings include efficiency, security and convenience, and availability. Our competitors fall primarily into the following groups:
 

● | Traditional course offerings in physical facilities; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | On-line course offerings from traditional colleges, universities, or other institutes of higher education. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of the companies, colleges, or universities against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in education, software design and development, and have already obtained approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified engineers, scientists, and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
We expect that the competitive landscape will continue to expand as the market for online programs at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | brand awareness and reputation; 
--+------------------------------------


● | ability of online programs to deliver desired student outcomes; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | robustness and evolution of technology offering; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------

● | breadth and depth of service offering; 
--+-------------------------------------------


● | ability to invest in launching and operating programs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | expertise in program marketing, student acquisition and student retention; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | quality of user experience; 
--+--------------------------------


● | ease of deployment and use of solutions; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | level of customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of solutions; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | quality of customer base and track record of performance. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, upon our ability to consistently deliver high-quality technology solutions for our learners, meet customer needs for content delivery at reasonable cost, and engage, support and retain learners who achieve high-quality outcomes.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
The higher education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities, namely, the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies, and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws.
 
We contract with higher education institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with customers. Our failure, or that of our customers, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our customers to maintain compliance with education laws.
 
We will abide, as required, by the education laws, including incentive compensation rule, misrepresentation rule, accreditation rules and standards, among all state and federal regulations. We also closely monitor state law developments and we will work closely with our customers to assist them with obtaining any required approvals.
 
Our activities on behalf of our customers are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as federal and state data protection and privacy requirements.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to implement a sales and marketing program prior to the launch of our platform. As the platform progresses through development, design, and testing, we intend to gather information regarding our on-line courses and use such information for marketing and sales of courses through our platform.
 
We also intend to simultaneously develop a branding strategy to introduce and support our platform. The strategy may include our presence at colleges, universities, and other educational institutions on a national, state, and regional basis to engage and educate users of our products, as well as engaging in a variety of other direct marketing methods.
 
We also intend to develop a small direct sales force together with a distribution network that has existing relationships with colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.
