Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
We are a fiber broadband and managed IT services provider, offering technology and service enabled customer solutions to business and wholesale customers in and out of Alaska. We also provide telecommunication services to consumers in the most populated communities throughout the state. Our facilities based communications network extends through the economically significant portions of Alaska and connects to the contiguous states via our two diverse undersea fiber optic cable systems. Our network is among the most expansive in Alaska and forms the foundation of service to our customers. We operate in a largely two-player terrestrial wireline market and we estimate our market share to be less than 25% statewide. However, we sponsored a third-party market study in the fourth quarter of 2018 which suggests that our market share in “near net”, that is, within one mile of our fiber footprint, may be closer to 40%. This is consistent with our hypothesis that from a revenue performance perspective, relative to our largest competitor we are gaining market share in the markets we are serving.
 
Our parent company, Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc., was incorporated in 1998 under the laws of the state of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 600 Telephone Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99503-6091. Our telephone number is (907) 297-3000 and our investor internet address is www.alsk.com. Our customer internet address is www.AlaskaCommunications.com.
 
Markets, Services and Products
 
We operate our business under a single reportable segment. We manage our revenues based on the sale of services and products to the three customer categories listed below.

● | Business and Wholesale (broadband, voice and managed IT services)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer (broadband and voice services)
--+----------------------------------------


● | Regulatory (access services, high cost support and carrier termination)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The brand pillars supporting our products and services are reliability, customer service, trustworthiness and local presence. These are represented by the promise we make to our customers: “You can always expect to get the service as promised to you by an Alaska Communications’ representative. If you are not satisfied, we will work with you to provide a solution that meets your satisfaction.”
 
See “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for a description of our products and services and a summary of service and product revenues generated by each of the above three customer categories.

Network and Technology
 
There are two extensive facilities based wireline telecommunications networks in Alaska. We operate one of these networks and General Communication, Inc. (“GCI”) operates the other. We provide high-capacity Ethernet-based services as well as switched and dedicated voice and broadband services. In addition, we offer other value added services such as network hosting, managed IT services and long distance services. We continuously upgrade our network to provide higher levels of performance, higher bandwidth speeds, increased levels of security and additional value added services to our customers. Our networks are monitored for performance around the clock in redundant monitoring centers to provide a high level of reliability and performance. Our fiber network is made up of more than 130,000 terrestrial and submarine fiber miles and serves as the backbone of our network. It is extensive within Alaska’s urban areas and connects our largest markets, including Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau with each other and the contiguous states. We have recently added Fixed Wireless towers and technology to reach even more customers. Both offer us the opportunity to provide our customers with a high level of network reliability and speed for voice and broadband applications. We also own and operate one of the most expansive Internet Protocol (“IP”) networks in Alaska using multi-protocol label switching (“MPLS”) and Metro Ethernet technology, along with Software-Defined Networking (“SD-WAN”) capabilities. Our MPLS network provides customers with Quality of Service capabilities and prioritization of data based on data-type over our Metro Ethernet service, which we market to health care, businesses and government customers. Coupled with SD-WAN technology our customers receive highly reliable and highly affordable service. Metro Ethernet offers our customers scalable, high-speed broadband and customized IT products and services, as well as Internet connectivity. We are one of the few Metro Ethernet Forum certified carriers in the nation, providing the highest degree of assurance to our customers regarding the quality of our network and services.
 
We also own and operate two undersea fiber optic cable systems that connect our Alaskan network to our facilities in Oregon and Washington. These facilities provide the most survivable service to and from Alaska, with key monitoring and disaster recovery capabilities for our customers. We also have usage rights on a third undersea fiber network connected to the lower-48.
 
Our network in Oregon and Washington includes terrestrial transport components linking our landing stations to a Network Operations Control Center in Hillsboro, Oregon and collocation facilities in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In addition, AKORN®, one of our undersea fiber optic cable systems, connects our Alaska network from Homer, Alaska to our facilities in Florence, Oregon along a diverse path within Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and undersea in the Pacific Ocean. Northstar, our other undersea fiber optic system, has cable landing facilities in Whittier, Juneau, and Valdez, Alaska, and Nedonna Beach, Oregon. Our subsea capacity including the AKORN® and Northstar systems provides a total of 7,800 route miles, or about 26,000 fiber miles, of submarine fiber. Together, these fiber optic cables provide extensive bandwidth as well as survivability protection designed to serve our own, as well as our most demanding customers’ critical communications requirements. In 2017, we upgraded the AKORN system to be able to support 100GB circuits for customers and in 2019 we will perform a similar upgrade to the NorthStar system. Through our landing stations in Oregon, we also provide an at-the-ready landing point for other large fiber optic cables, and their operators, connecting the U.S. to networks in Asia and other parts of the world.
 
In April 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase a terrestrial fiber network on the North Slope of Alaska. This network allows us to provide broadband solutions to the oil and gas sector in a market that previously had no competition, and continue to advance our sales of managed IT services.
 
In 2017, we began the development of a satellite earth station network and acquired C-band transponder space on Eutelsat’s E115WB satellite. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we began providing Internet backhaul connectivity to our first customer and, in 2018, we continued to provide service to customers in areas of Alaska we were previously not able to support with our terrestrial network.
 
Another Alaska carrier, Quintillion, has invested in a submarine network with landing stations in several northwest Alaska communities, including a terrestrial route from the North Slope to Fairbanks. The submarine network became operational in late 2017. We have acquired capacity on this system and began delivering service to customers in this area, including a buildout of terrestrial fiber optic cable, in Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) to serve this new market. We are currently serving customers in Utqiaġvik, Nome and Kotzebue.
 
Competition
 
Management estimates the Alaska wireline telecom and IT services market to be approximately $1.65 billion. This market is comprised of the IT services market of approximately $840 million, the broadband market of approximately $700 million and the voice market of approximately $110 million. Management estimates that over 85% of this market opportunity is from the business and wholesale customer segment. We sponsored a third-party market study in the fourth quarter of 2018 that suggests approximately $250 million of the telecom opportunity is “near net,” that is, within one mile of our fiber infrastructure.

We expect to experience continued growth in managed IT services over time by providing these services to our broadband customers as well as creating new customer relationships. We believe the competition for managed IT services is fragmented.
 
We face strong competition in our markets from larger competitors with substantial resources. For traditional voice and broadband services, we compete with GCI and AT&T on a statewide basis, and smaller providers such as Matanuska Telephone Association, Inc. on a more localized basis.
 
As the largest facilities based operator in Alaska, GCI is the dominant statewide provider of broadband, voice, wireless and video services. In the markets where we compete with GCI (broadband and voice), GCI has approximately 50% to 60% of market share across the consumer and business segments. GCI continues to expand its voice and data network, often taking advantage of subsidized government programs which create a monopoly for services in certain markets. AT&T’s primary focus is to be the provider of voice and broadband services to its nation-wide customers. AT&T tends to use its existing broadband network to serve these customers or it leases capacity from GCI or Alaska Communications to augment its existing network.
 
Overall competitive dynamics are significant, and our operating performance is impacted accordingly. For more information associated with the risks of our competitive environment see “Item 1A, Risk Factors.”
 
Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy relies on our understanding the Alaskan market, while increasingly using digital technologies to focus our marketing messages. We tailor our products and services based on understanding our customers’ needs, location, and type of service they desire. For business customers, we bundle our products and provide value added managed IT services using our local service delivery model and highly reliable network. For consumer customers, we focus on offering one flat rate price and no data usage caps for internet services, differentiating ourselves from GCI who charges for excess data usage or throttles bandwidth.
Sales and Distribution Channels
 
Our sales strategy combines primarily direct distribution channels to retain current customers and drive sales growth. Our focus in 2019 is to continue leveraging our direct sales channels’ focus on serving Business and Wholesale customers, our web and contact center channels for consumer customers, and expand our penetration of the military housing market for continued sustained performance. We are also continuing our efforts to improve customer service and move more consumer transactions to the web.
Customer Base
 
We generate our revenue through a diverse statewide customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers. Business and wholesale customers are our primary focus and they comprised 62% of our total revenue in 2018. Revenue from our rural health care customers, including the portion funded through the universal service support mechanism, is a component of business and wholesale revenue, and represented approximately 8% of our consolidated revenue in 2018. Regulatory revenue represented 22% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2018.
Seasonality
 
We believe our revenue is impacted by seasonal factors. This is due to Alaska’s northern latitude and the resulting wide swing in available daylight and weather conditions between summer and winter months. These conditions, unique to Alaska, affect business, tourism and telecom use patterns in the state. Our spending patterns are also impacted by seasonality as we incur more capital spending and operating spending during the summer and early fall periods of the year, reflecting the heightened economic activity from the summer months and our own construction activities during this time period.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 584 regular full-time employees, 8 regular part-time employees and 4 temporary employees. Approximately 53% of our employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1547 (“IBEW”). Our Master Collective Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”) with the IBEW, which is effective through December 31, 2023, governs the terms and conditions of employment for all IBEW represented employees working for us in the state of Alaska. Management considers employee relations to be generally good.

Regulation
 
While a substantial amount of our revenue is derived from non-regulated or non-common carrier services, we continue to generate revenue from services that are regulated. Given the breadth of the regulatory framework, the following summary of the regulatory environment in which our business operates does not describe all present and proposed federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry in Alaska.
Overview
 
Some of the telecommunications services we provide are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. These regulations govern, in part, our rates and the way we conduct our business, including the requirement to offer telecommunications services pursuant to nondiscriminatory rates, terms, and conditions, the obligation to comply with E-911 rules, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”), the obligation to safeguard the confidentiality of customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”), as well as our obligation to maintain specialized records and file reports with the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and state regulators. These requirements are subject to frequent change. Compliance is costly, and limits our ability to respond to some of the demands of our increasingly competitive service markets.
 
We generate revenue from these regulated services through regulated charges to our retail and wholesale customers, access and other charges to other carriers, and federal and state universal service support mechanisms for telecommunications and broadband services. These revenues are recorded throughout our customer categories.
 
At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the interstate and international telecommunications services that regulated common carriers provide and their related communications facilities.
 
The Regulatory Commission of Alaska (“RCA”) generally exercises jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services that originate and terminate at points in Alaska.
 
In this section, “Regulation”, we refer to our local exchange carrier (“LEC”) subsidiaries individually as follows:
 

● | ACS of Anchorage, LLC (“ACSA”); 
--+------------------------------------
● | ACS of Alaska, LLC (“ACSAK”); 
● | ACS of Fairbanks, LLC (“ACSF”); and
● | ACS of the Northland, LLC (“ACSN”).

Federal Regulation 
 
We must comply with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) and regulations promulgated thereunder, which together require, among other things, that we offer regulated interstate telecommunications services upon request at just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates and terms. The Communications Act also requires us to offer competing carriers interconnection and non-discriminatory access to certain facilities and services designated as essential for local competition, and permits the FCC to deregulate us as markets become more competitive. Under the Communications Act we are eligible for support revenues to help defray the cost of providing services in rural, high cost areas, and to low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers. In recent years, the FCC has modified these support mechanisms to incentivize wider availability of affordable broadband Internet access services, and promote additional deployment of equipment, facilities, and systems necessary to support such services. In ongoing administrative rulemaking proceedings, the FCC is continuing to propose changes in the size and scope of these mechanisms, and it is difficult to predict the impact such changes may have on our business.
Rate Regulation
 
Our LEC subsidiaries are regulated common carriers offering local voice and a limited set of telecommunications data services. In providing these regulated services, these subsidiaries are subject to competitive market forces, as well as rate-of-return regulations for intrastate services that originate and terminate in Alaska and price-cap rate regulation for interstate services regulated by the FCC. Because they face competition, our LEC subsidiaries may not be able to charge their maximum permitted rates under price-cap regulation or realize their authorized intrastate rate of return even where they are rate-of-return regulated. A broader range of data and information services are offered by our unregulated affiliates or as unregulated services by our regulated companies.
 
 8


In establishing their costs of regulated telecommunications services, our LEC subsidiaries determine their aggregate costs and place them within an FCC-prescribed Uniform System of Accounts, then allocate those costs between regulated and non-regulated services, then separate the regulated portion of these costs between the state and federal jurisdictions, and finally among specific inter- and intra-state services. This process is governed primarily by the FCC and the RCA rules and regulations. In August 2014, the FCC opened a proceeding to consider whether to modify or eliminate its cost accounting rules. On February 23, 2017, the FCC adopted an Order streamlining its regulatory accounting rules and harmonizing them with generally accepted accounting practices.
 
In addition, for more than two decades, the FCC has been considering whether to modify or eliminate the current jurisdictional separations process, and it has asked the Federal-State Joint Board on Jurisdictional Separations for recommendations for doing so. For most of that time, the jurisdictional separations rules have remained frozen. In December 2018, the FCC extended the current freeze for six additional years, through December 31, 2024, and directed that Joint Board in the short term to consider amending the jurisdictional separations rules to recognize that the rates of price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, are no longer subject to them. Nevertheless, these questions remain pending with the FCC. The FCC’s decision, when it comes, could indirectly increase or reduce earnings of carriers subject to jurisdictional separations rules by affecting the way costs are divided between regulated and unregulated services, and the way regulated costs are divided between the federal and state jurisdictions. In addition, these changes could affect the ways in which the FCC and RCA evaluate the reasonableness of our regulated rates for telecommunications services.
 
Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Services
 
In March 2015, the FCC reclassified mass market broadband Internet access services as a “telecommunications service,” subject to common carrier pricing and other regulations under Title II of the Communications Act, which had historically applied only to traditional telephone service. The FCC thus departed from its long history of treating broadband Internet access services as “information services,” which are subject to far less intrusive federal oversight, though the FCC declared its intention not to require broadband Internet access service providers to file federal “tariffs” or otherwise obtain advance FCC review or approval of the rates, terms, and conditions under which they offer broadband Internet access service. In June 2016, the FCC’s decision was upheld on appeal by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
 
On December 14, 2017, the FCC reversed these actions and restored its classification of broadband Internet access service as an “information service” subject to “light touch” federal regulation. The FCC also repealed the broad “Internet Conduct” standard, which had created significant regulatory uncertainty among service providers. By taking these actions, the FCC also restored the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission over consumer protection issues arising in connection with broadband Internet access services. The FCC’s new rules require Internet Service Providers to disclose information about their practices to consumers, entrepreneurs, and the Commission, including any blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliated prioritization, but no longer prohibit such practices. The FCC found that disclosure of these operational practices, coupled with market forces and antitrust and consumer protection laws, would achieve the goals of Title II regulation, at lower cost.
 
The new rules took effect, in part, on April 23, 2018, while the changes that amend information collection requirements took effect following the required Office of Management and Budget approval on June 11, 2018. While it remains difficult to assess the full extent of the impact of these changes on our business, the more narrowly tailored regulatory framework has the potential to improve the performance of our broadband Internet access services (by, among other things, permitting us to better manage network congestion), reduce our regulatory compliance costs, and facilitate new investment.

Interconnection with Local Telephone Companies and Access to Other Facilities 
 
The Communications Act imposes a number of requirements on LECs. Generally, a LEC must: not prohibit or unreasonably restrict the resale of its services; provide for telephone number portability so customers may keep the same telephone number if they switch service providers; provide access to their poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way on a reasonable, non-discriminatory basis; and, when a call originates on its network, compensate other telephone companies for terminating or transporting the call (see the “Interstate Access” discussion below).
 
All of our LEC subsidiaries are considered incumbent LECs (“ILECs”) and have additional obligations under the Communications Act: to negotiate in good faith with any carrier requesting interconnection; to provide interconnection for the transmission and routing of telecommunications at any technically feasible point in our ILEC network on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates, terms and conditions; to provide access to unbundled network elements (“UNEs”), such as local loops at non-discriminatory, cost-based rates to competing carriers that would be “impaired” without them; to offer retail local telephone services to resellers at discounted wholesale rates; to provide notice of changes in information needed for another carrier to transmit and route services using its facilities; and to provide, at rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory, physical collocation, which allows a competitive LEC (“CLEC”) to install and maintain its network termination equipment in an ILEC’s central office, or to obtain functionally equivalent forms of interconnection.
 
Our ACSN ILEC subsidiary is classified as a rural telephone company under the statute and therefore falls within a federal statutory exemption from the requirements imposed on most ILECs to provide UNEs to a CLEC. The RCA may terminate the exemption if it determines that interconnection is technically feasible, not unduly economically burdensome and consistent with universal service. Although the RCA has not terminated ACSN’s UNE exemption, the RCA granted GCI, subject to certain conditions, approval to provide local exchange telephone service in the Glacier State study area and Sitka exchange of ACSN on its own facilities. Other than the City of Sitka, all other exchanges in the Sitka study area remain unserved by any CLEC at this time.
 
On December 28, 2006, the FCC conditionally and partially granted ACSA forbearance from the obligation to lease UNEs to our competitors. This forbearance was limited to five wire centers within the Anchorage service area. Even where relief was granted, however, the FCC has required ACSA to lease loops and sub-loops at commercially negotiated rates, or if there is no commercial agreement, at the rates for these UNEs in Fairbanks. As a result of this decision, on March 15, 2007, our LECs entered into a five-year global interconnection and resale agreement with GCI governing the provision of UNEs and other services. The successor to that agreement remains in effect.
 
On December 28, 2015, the FCC issued an order granting “forbearance” from certain ILEC obligations under the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules. As of that date, the FCC has relieved our ILEC subsidiaries of “dialing parity” and “equal access” obligations that, formerly, required us to ensure that customers were able to route their calls to other telecommunications service providers without having to dial additional digits, and to allow each of our ILEC telephone service customers to choose among any available providers of stand-alone interstate long-distance service, which the customer could then reach simply by dialing “1.” We must continue to offer those capabilities to any customer that has presubscribed to a stand-alone interstate long-distance provider prior to December 28, 2015, but are not required to make long-distance presubscription available to new customers. In May 2017, the FCC rejected a Petition for Reconsideration that had sought to reinstate these obligations in “rural areas of Alaska.”
 
In the same 2015 order, the FCC granted our ILEC affiliates forbearance in two additional areas: (i) the FCC granted limited forbearance from our ILEC affiliates’ obligation to offer competitive access to newly-deployed entrance conduit running from the property line to a commercial building in “greenfield” situations where no service provider has an established presence; and (ii) our ILECs are no longer required to offer competitors unbundled access to a 64-kilobit-per-second voice channel in areas where we have replaced last mile copper loop connections to our customers with fiber optic cables.
 
On June 26, 2017, we filed a Petition with the FCC requesting that GCI be treated as the sole ILEC in our ACSA study area, and that ACSA be treated as a nondominant carrier and relieved of its ILEC obligations under the Communications Act. That Petition remains pending at the FCC.
 
Interstate Access Charges 
 
The FCC regulates the prices that ILECs charge for the use of their local telephone facilities in originating or terminating interstate calls.
 
 10


Special Access Pricing Flexibility and Business Data Services
 
Rates for interstate telecommunications services offered by our ILEC subsidiaries are determined using price cap regulation, under which the rates vary from year to year based on mathematical formulae, and not based on changes to our costs, including both inter-carrier rates and retail end user rates. Since 2010, ACSA, ACSF, and ACSAK have had the right under the FCC’s Phase I and Phase II pricing flexibility rules to offer flexible pricing arrangements such as volume and term discounts free from FCC rate structure and price-cap rules for qualifying services, including dedicated transport and special access services in the Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks areas.
 
On April 20, 2017, the FCC adopted an Order updating its regulations governing “business data services,” which are those circuit-switched or packet-switched services that offer our dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections, including special access services. The FCC left in place the Phase I and Phase II pricing flexibility it granted to us in 2010, and granted further price deregulation of all business data services with transmission speeds above 45 Megabits per second. For legacy circuit-switched business data services with speeds at or below that level (DS-3 or below), the FCC adopted a new competitive market test, finding that price regulation is no longer required in counties (or county-equivalents, such as Alaskan boroughs) where (a) 50 percent of the buildings in a county are within a half-mile of a location served by a competitive provider; or (b) 75 percent of the census blocks in a county have a cable provider present. We are permitted to remove business data services in competitive areas from our tariffs over the next three years, following which time we will be required to do so. In areas that do not meet this competitive market test, the FCC adjusted its “price cap” rules governing rates for certain legacy services that will continue to be regulated, but also permitted us to offer those services with volume and term discounts, as well as under contract tariffs, which is the equivalent of the former Phase I pricing flexibility. We are still evaluating the impact of the FCC’s order but, in general, we expect this FCC Order to support the Company’s ability to be market competitive for its business data services.
 
On August 28, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated portions of the FCC’s decision that ended prior regulation and tariffing of prices of legacy circuit-switched transport services offered by price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, finding that the FCC had not provided sufficient advance notice of that aspect of its decision. On October 24, 2018, in order to provide the necessary notice in light of the Eighth Circuit’s decision, the FCC issued a detailed proposal to re-adopt that relief. The comment cycle was delayed by the recent shutdown of the FCC as a result of a lapse in federal appropriations, and the matter remains pending.
 
Transformation Order
 
Under a 2011 FCC order (the “Transformation Order”), our ILEC interstate and intrastate switched access rates and reciprocal compensation rates (“ICC rates”) are capped and declining toward zero, in pursuit of the FCC’s goal that carriers will recover their costs from their end-users and, in some cases, universal service support mechanisms.
 
The transition unfolded over a six-year period beginning July 1, 2012. As a result:
 

● | all terminating switched end-office rates and reciprocal compensation rates were reduced to zero on July 1, 2017; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | for a terminating ILEC that owns the tandem switch, terminating switched end-office rates and terminating switched transport rates were reduced to $0.0007 for all traffic within the tandem serving area on July 1, 2017, and to zero on July 1, 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Transformation Order provides for a certain amount of compensation for lost revenue through two optional programs: (i) an access recovery charge on subscribers and (ii) a temporary access replacement support mechanism with broadband build-out obligations. However, the FCC does not intend the results of the changes necessarily to be revenue-neutral to any ILEC and various caps, limitations, market forces and, ultimately, phase-outs apply to both of these programs. Furthermore, we did not meet the required criteria for imposing an access recovery charge, and received no revenue from that source. As a result, the Company’s ILEC affiliates have experienced an overall decline in access charge revenues over the course of the transition. In a July 2016 Order, the FCC found that ILECs are non-dominant in the market for switched access services nationwide, but declined to provide any significant relief from existing levels of federal regulation as a result of that finding.
 
 11


Federal Universal Service Support
 
The Communications Act requires the FCC to establish a universal service program to ensure that affordable, quality telecommunications services are available to all Americans. The Company has received universal support in several forms: (i) high cost support received by its ILEC subsidiaries for its wireline voice and broadband Internet access service business under the Connect America Fund; (ii) support for services that the Company provides to schools and libraries, provided through the federal schools and libraries universal service support mechanism (“E-Rate”); (iii) support from the federal Rural Health Care support mechanism, which supports communications services that enable telehealth and telemedicine services provided by eligible rural health care providers; and (iv) low income support under the FCC’s Lifeline program, which subsidizes telephone and broadband Internet access services for low-income consumers. These programs are administered under the direction of the FCC by the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”).
 
Historically, the level of high cost support received by the Company’s LEC subsidiaries was based on the costs those subsidiaries incurred in providing telecommunications services, although a portion of the support was frozen at the time our LEC subsidiaries converted to federal price cap regulation and, for ACSA, based on the results of a cost model. The 2011 Transformation Order made a number of changes, including replacing legacy high cost support mechanisms with the Connect America Fund (“CAF”) mechanism discussed below.
 
Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Program
 
The FCC’s Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism provides funding to help make broadband telecommunications and Internet access services provided by the Company and other service providers affordable for eligible rural health care providers. It is comprised of two parts. The Telecommunications Program covers the difference between the “urban rate” for telecommunications services that rural healthcare providers use to deliver healthcare at rural locations, and the “rural rate” that they would otherwise be required to pay. The Healthcare Connect Fund covers 65 percent of the cost of a wider variety of broadband telecommunications, networking, and Internet access services and certain associated equipment. Through June 30, 2017, the budget for the entire Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism was set at $400 million annually, including administrative expenses, a significant portion of which is used to assist eligible rural health care providers in Alaska.
 
Beginning with Funding Year 2016 (July 1, 2016 – June 30, 2017), demand for support under the program exceeded the $400 million budget. The budget constraints prompted USAC to engage in substantially more rigorous review of requests for rural health care support, raising compliance costs and delaying issuance of support payments. The rising uncertainty and unpredictability in the Rural Health Care program caused a negative impact on revenue for the Company in 2017, and may have a negative impact on future revenue and demand for our services from rural healthcare providers.
 
For Funding Year 2017, which began July 1, 2017, demand for support from the Rural Health Care support mechanism again exceeded the $400 million cap. As a result, USAC had announced that successful non-consortium applicants would receive approximately 84.4% of the support for which they would otherwise be eligible. On June 25, 2018, the FCC issued an Order retroactively increasing that cap to $571 million for Funding Year 2017. The increase permitted full funding of all Funding Year 2017 requests that USAC or the FCC determined were otherwise in compliance with the governing rules. In the near term, we expect that the increase to reduce or eliminate the need for reductions in support payments as a result of FCC-imposed budget constraints, but it has not reduced the rigor with which USAC is now reviewing funding requests for rural health care support. We continue to advocate for the FCC to adopt further increases in the budget for this program.
 
Separately, USAC determined that it was unable to approve the vast majority of our rural healthcare customers’ Funding Year 2017 funding requests until the FCC approved “rural rates” for use in computing support amounts to be committed under the Telecommunications Program. On March 22, 2018, we filed a Petition with the FCC asking the FCC to direct USAC to issue funding commitments to our customers based on rates we proposed in the Petition. On July 18, 2018, we announced that the FCC had approved those rates for use in determining rural health care support levels for our rural health care customers for Funding Year 2017. USAC has now completed the initial administrative processes associated with our rural health care provider customers’ requests for support, and we have received the associated support payments for services delivered to our rural health care customers during Funding Year 2017. In a few cases, USAC denied funding based on other concerns, and appeals of those funding denials are now pending.
 
 12


The FCC’s June 25, 2018 Order also directed that the rural health care funding cap be indexed for inflation, so that, for Funding Year 2018, which began July 1, 2018, the cap is now $581 million. In addition, beginning with Funding Year 2018, any unused funds from one Funding Year may be carried forward for use in subsequent Funding Years. We again requested that the FCC approve rural rates for the services we provide to our rural healthcare customers that are seeking subsidies from the Rural Health Care support mechanism for Funding Year 2018, and the FCC approved those rates in November 2018. We have begun receiving funding commitments and payments for Funding Year 2018 receivables, reducing our carrying costs below Funding Year 2017 levels.
 
We are also working to reduce the level of regulatory and business uncertainty associated with our rural healthcare business in two additional ways. First, in November 2018, we requested FCC approval for rural rates for Funding Year 2019, which will begin July 1, 2019, in order to shorten the USAC funding request approval process and bring greater certainty to the competitive bidding process for rural healthcare provider services that began in January 2019. Second, we continue to advocate for the FCC expeditiously to adopt rules to reform and modernize the Rural Health Care Telecommunications Program, on which the majority of healthcare providers in Alaska rely, in the proceeding that began in December 2017. In December 2018, FCC Chairman Pai committed in a letter to Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan to move forward with an order adopting new rules for the Rural Health Care Program in 2019, with a target of doing so in the first half of the year. If the FCC meets that timeline, it is possible that new rules would be in place to govern the bidding and funding commitment process for Funding Year 2020, which will begin July 1, 2020.
 
At this time, it is impossible to predict the outcome of that rulemaking process or the impact the new rules may have. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the funding cap constraints, ongoing uncertainty and unpredictability in the Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism, and the potential impact of future rule changes on our rural health care customers and revenues in light of these developments.
 
Connect America Fund
 
CAF Phase I
 
The FCC implemented the Connect America Fund in two primary phases. CAF Phase I froze our LECs’ high cost support, beginning in 2012, at the 2011 level, and requires us to use that support to provide broadband fixed services in high cost areas served by our price-cap LEC subsidiaries. In addition, in 2012 and 2013, the FCC made two rounds of additional CAF Phase I Incremental Support available to certain price-cap carriers serving the highest-cost wire centers, conditioned on the carriers deploying additional broadband service to unserved locations (or, in the case of Round 2 support, locations that are served by broadband, but that do not receive actual speeds of at least 3 Mbps/768 kbps) over the three-year period following the award of support. We completed our obligations associated with both CAF Phase I frozen support and Round 1 and Round 2 incremental support within the required three-year period.
CAF Phase II
 
CAF Phase II supplanted the CAF Phase I frozen support mechanism and requires recipients to provide broadband service to unserved locations throughout the designated coverage area by the end of a specified build-out period, as well as to meet interim milestone build-out obligations.
 
On October 31, 2016, the FCC released its order adopting CAF Phase II (“CAF II”) for price cap carriers in Alaska. Alaska Communications is the only price cap carrier in Alaska and, under the CAF II order, we will receive approximately $19.7 million annually (the same amount we received as CAF I high cost frozen support) for the ten-year period starting January 1, 2016 and continuing through December 31, 2025. To receive this support, we committed to provide voice and broadband Internet access service to approximately 31,500 locations in census blocks that are unserved or only partially served by any unsubsidized competitor. These will include approximately 26,000 locations that did not previously have access to broadband Internet access service.

On December 28, 2017, Alaska Communications filed a notice with the FCC proposing to serve 4,762 unique geocoded locations (encompassing 6,056 unserved customer locations because some are in multi-unit buildings) in partially-served census blocks to partially fulfill this requirement. On March 27, 2018, GCI filed a challenge at the FCC, asserting that it serves 3,099 of these locations, and we filed a response, disputing that assertion. On September 28, 2018, the FCC granted our request with respect to 1,713 unique geocoded locations, which will assist us in meeting our CAF Phase II deployment obligation.
 
In addition, on June 21, 2018, we filed a supplemental notice with the FCC proposing to serve an additional 3,253 unique geocoded locations (encompassing 4,691 unserved customer locations) in partially-served census blocks, again to partially fulfill our CAF Phase II deployment obligation. On September 4, 2018, GCI filed a challenge at the FCC, asserting that it serves 2,604 of those 3,253 locations. The FCC has not yet ruled on this challenge. As with the initial list, if the FCC ultimately determines that we are not able to satisfy our CAF Phase II deployment obligation by serving some or all of those locations, it may be more difficult and costly to meet our CAF Phase II deployment requirements at other locations.
 
On April 26, 2018, the FCC released an Order denying our request to modify the conditions on our use of CAF Phase II high cost support. The CAF locations may include up to 2,714 unserved locations in census blocks deemed “low-cost” by the FCC, so long as we certify that the capital expenditure to serve each such location was at least $5,000.00. The FCC denied our request to reduce that minimum capital expenditure requirement to $2,577.79. As a result of this denial, we may find it more difficult to identify eligible service locations to meet our CAF Phase II deployment requirement.
 
We are continuing to work toward meeting our CAF Phase II obligations in a capital-efficient manner, including the potential to deliver broadband Internet access services meeting CAF Phase II requirements using a fixed wireless platform.
 
Lifeline
 
Revenue generated from our lifeline customers represented less than 1% of our total revenue for each of the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The FCC’s Lifeline support mechanism today subsidizes the cost of voice services for low-income consumers, as well as broadband in CAF II locations. The Lifeline mechanism provides a higher level of support for low-income consumers living on Tribal Lands, including the entire state of Alaska. Under reforms adopted in the FCC’s January 2012 Lifeline Order, we are required to recertify each of our Lifeline customers annually to verify continued eligibility for Lifeline service. In part as a result of those efforts, our Lifeline enrollment decreased, and we will face continuing compliance obligations with respect to Lifeline customers served by our LEC subsidiaries. There are a number of matters under consideration that could increase the Company’s regulatory compliance obligations and customer administrative responsibilities, and impact revenue received from regulatory funding sources.
Lifeline Reform
 
On April 27, 2016, the FCC released the text of new rules making stand-alone broadband service, as well as bundled voice and data service packages, eligible for Lifeline support, in addition to traditional voice service. After receiving approval from the Office of Management and Budget, the rules making Lifeline a supported service took effect on December 2, 2016. The Company’s ILECs have obtained forbearance from the FCC obligation to provide Lifeline broadband in those locations not funded by CAF Phase II.
 
In the same order, the FCC established a process for creating a national Lifeline eligibility verifier to ensure that all Lifeline subscribers meet the program’s eligibility requirements, which is becoming operational in stages over the next several years. The national Lifeline eligibility verifier launched in Alaska in February 2019. While it is too soon to assess the impact of this change, the availability of this service could potentially reduce our costs of compliance with Lifeline eligibility certification and recertification rules.

Satellite Services
 
On February 16, 2018, the FCC granted our application for a license to operate a network of C-band satellite earth stations to be used to serve our customers that cannot be reached by terrestrial middle mile facilities. Under that license, we are authorized to use up to 72 MHz of C-band spectrum on Eutelsat’s satellite, E115WB, for a term of 15 years. In June 2018, the FCC granted our application to expand that network to include new customer sites, and we have since requested authority to double the amount of spectrum we are authorized to use, up to 144 MHz, and serve additional sites. We expect this arrangement to provide us with greater predictability and stability in the availability and cost of long-haul transport connectivity to our customers that must be served by satellite.
 
Our C-band satellite earth stations use the 3.7 - 4.2 GHz band to receive downlink transmissions from geostationary satellites. On April 19, 2018, the Wireless Telecommunications, International, and Public Safety Bureaus of the FCC announced an immediate, temporary freeze on the filing of new or modification applications for fixed-satellite service earth station licenses, receive-only earth station registrations, and fixed microwave licenses in the 3.7 - 4.2 GHz portion of the C-band spectrum, in order to preserve the current landscape of authorized operations in that band while the Commission continues to examine opportunities to permit expanded terrestrial use of that band for mobile broadband and additional fixed services. On July 13, 2018, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on options for expanding terrestrial use of the 3.7 - 4.2 GHz band for “5G” services. In response, we have filed comments and reply comments advocating for continued access to this spectrum for satellite downlink operations in Alaska. We are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding. If the FCC adopts rules that limit our ability to register additional satellite earth stations in this band, or expands terrestrial transmissions in the 3.7 - 4.2 GHz band, it may become more difficult or costly for us to use this band, or necessitate relocation of our services to alternative spectrum bands.
 
In October 2018, the FCC also opened a proceeding to examine possible new terrestrial uses of the 6 GHz band, including the 5.925-6.425 GHz spectrum used for C-band satellite uplink transmissions originating from terrestrial earth stations to geostationary satellites in orbit. Because C-band earth stations are transmitting in that band, not receiving, we expect any increase in terrestrial use of the 6 GHz band to have a less severe impact on our satellite C-band network than would use of the 3.7-4.2 GHz receive band. Nevertheless, we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these proceedings, or to assess any potential future impact on our C-band satellite services.
 
Other Federal Regulations
 
In August 2015, the FCC adopted new rules to govern aspects of the ongoing transition from legacy copper transmission facilities to new IP-based networks. In general, those rules impose an additional 180-day advance disclosure requirement when incumbent local exchange carriers, such as the Company, plan to retire copper transmission lines connecting to our customers’ premises or replace them, in whole or in part, with fiber optic cable.
 
In November 2017, the FCC narrowed the scope of the copper retirement rules, simplified the notice process, shortened the required notice period from 180 days to 90 days, and adopted an expedited 15-day notice period applicable where the affected copper facilities are no longer being used to provide service. In comparison to the 2015 rules, we expect these revisions to make it easier for us to comply with the regulatory processes associated with network upgrades from copper to fiber facilities, but we have found it necessary to request waivers of the FCC’s 90-day notice period when necessary to conform to the timing of pole-removal activities announced by electric power utilities that own the poles on which our copper facilities are located. In its November 2017 Order, the FCC also streamlined its rules governing the discontinuance of legacy low-speed voice and data services of less than 1.544 Mbps, which will also facilitate the transition to modern network technologies and services.
 
In August 2015, with respect to residential, fixed, facilities-based voice services that do not receive electrical power through the telephone line (such as fiber-to-the-home services), the FCC adopted rules requiring us to offer our customers the option to purchase equipment providing eight hours of standby backup power. Effective as of February 13, 2019, the FCC’s rules require us to offer these customers the option to purchase equipment that provides 24 hours of standby backup power.

State Regulation
 
Telecommunication companies are required to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from the RCA prior to operating as a public utility in Alaska. In addition, RCA approval is required if an entity acquires a controlling interest in any of our certificated subsidiaries, acquires a controlling interest in another intrastate utility or discontinues an intrastate service. The RCA also regulates rates, terms and conditions for local, intrastate access and intrastate long distance services, supervises the administration of the Alaska Universal Service Fund (“AUSF”) and decides on Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (“ETC”) status for purposes of qualifying for federal USF. The Communications Act specifies that resale and UNE rates are to be negotiated among the parties subject to the approval or arbitration of the RCA. Our ILECs have entered into interconnection agreements with a number of entities.
 
The FCC’s March 2015 order reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service also sought to limit the authority of state regulators over the service by finding that it is jurisdictionally interstate in nature. The FCC prohibited state regulators from imposing new state universal service contribution obligations on broadband Internet access services, and announced its intent to preempt any attempts by state regulators to impose entry certification restrictions, rate regulation, or tariff filing requirements in connection with broadband Internet access service.
 
Alaska Universal Service Fund 
 
The AUSF complements the federal Universal Service Fund, but is focused on obligations to meet intrastate service obligations. The RCA has opened an “information docket” to evaluate and scope a comprehensive AUSF reform rulemaking that might include consideration of the Fund’s continued need. The RCA also opened a rulemaking to review the regulations specific to AUSF shortfalls. A final decision in that matter was issued in late December, 2017. These rules were transmitted to the Lt. Governor for signature and became effective April, 2018. They eliminate the hierarchy of shortfall payments except for Lifeline and administrative operating expenses.
 
In January, 2018, the RCA opened a rulemaking to repeal the AUSF effective July 31, 2019, and sought comments and reply comments. The Alaska Telephone Association and its members filed a plan to cap the fund and distributions. AT&T, GCI, and Alaska Communications also filed comments and reply comments. A hearing was scheduled in April. A final order was issued by the RCA on October 24, 2018 with changes to the distribution to be effective January 1, 2019.
 
Prior to changes to the AUSF distribution, AUSF supported a portion of certain higher cost carriers’ switching costs, the costs of Lifeline service (which supports rates of low-income customers), the Carrier of Last Resort (“COLR”), Carrier Common Line (“CCL”) support program and other costs associated with regulated service. These funding mechanisms have been eliminated and replaced with a new funding mechanism called Essential Network Support (“ENS”). In addition, the AUSF surcharge has been capped at 10%.
 
In response to the FCC’s order eliminating Lifeline qualifying programs approved by state regulatory commissions, the Alaskan telecommunications industry has proposed a waiver of the state qualifying programs to align the state and federal qualifying programs. The RCA granted that waiver prior to December 2, 2016 when the new rules went into effect. In August 2017, the RCA opened a docket, R-17-002, on Lifeline to align the programs with the federal rules and revise the certification and verification procedures to reflect revised federal procedures. Lifeline service providers have been operating under an RCA order that aligns some issues and companies made tariff filings to align their procedures. This rulemaking is somewhat ministerial in nature but may become moot depending on the outcomes of the AUSF docket R-18-001. Comments were submitted in September 2017. The regulation docket has a final decision deadline of August 25, 2019. 
 
Other State Regulatory Matters 
 
The RCA opened three dockets on July 27, 2016 to investigate the continued need for COLR funding in competitive areas. Two of the dockets investigating the continued need for COLR funding affect the Fairbanks and Juneau markets. On May 24, 2017, the RCA issued an order approving the 2016 COLR filing for ACSF but denying the 2016 COLR filing for ACSAK and terminating its COLR status and related support. ACSAK petitioned for reconsideration which was denied, and on July 14, 2017 ACSAK filed a notice of appeal in the Anchorage Superior Court. ACSAK filed its appellant brief on March 1, 2018 simultaneously with MTA. Due to requests for extensions for extraordinary and compelling reasons, the RCA appellee brief was due on June 19, 2018 and ACSAK has an extension for its reply brief due on August 10, 2018. Oral arguments were originally scheduled for November 8, 2018 but were recently rescheduled for January 10, 2019.

The RCA denied ACSAK’s request for 2017 COLR filing and reinstatement of COLR status. The Company filed for 2017 COLR funding for ACSN and ACSF. The RCA suspended these filings on July 31, 2017. Adjudication of these matters was dismissed when the RCA opened the docket to repeal AUSF. AUSF COLR support for these two markets will continue subject to the RCA’s final decision. ACSF, ACSN, and ACSAK filed for 2018 COLR funding on June 18, 2018 and received notification of approval from the RCA on July 27, 2018.
