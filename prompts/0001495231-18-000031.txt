ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Our Mission
Our mission is to champion the world's creators by helping them monetize their content, creativity, and influence.
Our Business
IZEA creates and operates online marketplaces that connect marketers with content creators. The creators are compensated by IZEA for producing unique content such as long and short form text, videos, photos, status updates, and illustrations for marketers or distributing such content on behalf of marketers through their personal websites, blogs, and social media channels. Our technology brings the marketers and creators together, enabling their transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics and payment processing. 
Marketers, including brands, agencies, and publishers, engage us to gain access to our industry expertise, technology, analytics, and network of creators. The majority of the marketers engage us to perform these services on their behalf, but they also have the ability to use our marketplaces on a self-service basis. Our technology is used for two primary purposes: the engagement of creators for influencer marketing campaigns (also known as “Influencer Marketing”), or the engagement of creators to create stand-alone custom content for the marketers' own use and distribution (“Custom Content”).
Influencer Marketing. We work with marketers to enable influencer marketing campaigns at scale. A subset of influencer marketing known as “Sponsored Social” is when a company compensates an online influencer such as a blogger or tweeter (“creators”) to share sponsored content with the creator's social network following. This sponsored content is included within the body of the content stream. We believe that we pioneered the concept of a marketplace for sponsorships on the social web in 2006 with the launch of our first platform, PayPerPost, and have focused on scaling our product and service offerings ever since.
Custom Content. We also work with marketers to augment or replace their content development efforts. Our network of creators produce editorial and marketing content that can be published both online and offline. Our network of creators includes professional journalists, subject matter experts, bloggers and everyday content creators, allowing our customers to produce content ranging from complex white papers to simple product descriptions. Many of our content customers use this service to create a steady stream of posts for their corporate blog. We first began offering custom content services in 2015 after the acquisition of Ebyline, Inc. (“Ebyline”), a leading marketplace in the editorial content space, and continued to expand this offering with our acquisition of ZenContent, Inc. (“ZenContent”) in July 2016, a company that predominantly focused on e-commerce-related asset creation.
Our Platforms
The IZEA Exchange. We launched a public beta of IZEA.com powered by The IZEA Exchange (“IZEAx”) in March 2014 and unveiled our latest version 2.0 of the platform in February 2017. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of custom content through our creator's personal websites, blogs, and social media channels including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, among others. We extensively use this platform to manage Sponsored Social campaigns on behalf of our marketers. This platform is also available directly to our marketers as a self-service tool and as a licensed white label. IZEAx is engineered from the ground-up to replace all of our previous platforms with an integrated offering that is improved and more efficient. For influencer marketing campaigns, IZEAx provides integrated mechanisms for Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) legal compliance. In particular, the integrated FTC compliance framework requires creators to provide disclosure to their followers with respect to the sponsored nature of the content and allows marketers to review the content for FTC compliance. 
Ebyline.  In January 2015, we acquired Ebyline and its technology platform that was created to source and compensate creators specifically for the creation and delivery of professional editorial content. Ebyline was originally designed as a self-service content marketplace to replace editorial newsrooms in the news agencies with a “virtual newsroom” to handle their content workflow. After the acquisition, we began to utilize the creators in the Ebyline platform to produce professional custom content for brands, in addition to the self-service functionality used by newspapers. We are incorporating certain functions of this platform into IZEAx in order to have one consolidated platform in the future. We do not allocate any engineering resources to new feature development on the Ebyline platform. This is a legacy platform with declining revenue from a declining 
1

customer base that will eventually be sunsetted. We plan to transition any remaining customers into our IZEAx platform in the future.
ZenContent. In July 2016, we acquired ZenContent including its custom content creation workflow technology and database of creators. ZenContent’s platform enables us to produce highly scalable, multi-part production of content for both e-commerce entities, as well as brand customers. The ZenContent platform allows us to parse work out to a wide array of qualified creators who together can develop custom content assets with unmatched quality, speed, and price. This platform is currently utilized by our campaign fulfillment team to service orders for custom content. We plan to integrate certain functions of the ZenContent platform into IZEAx in order to have one consolidated platform in the future. 
IZEAx, Ebyline and ZenContent were designed with the same purpose: to streamline transactions between our internal campaign fulfillment team, marketers and creators. We utilize these proprietary technologies to create efficiencies and economies of scale for all parties. Combined, these platforms provide marketers with access to a large network of creators along with complete workflow management, content control, payment processing and related performance tracking. 
We believe that IZEAx should improve our ability to more efficiently match marketplace participants as the number of marketers and creators using the platform increases. To date, we have completed over 3.7 million social sponsorship transactions for customers ranging from small local businesses to Fortune 500 companies. We consider each individual piece of custom content, sponsored blog post, tweet or other update as an individual transaction so long as the creator of that content is being compensated for the transaction.
Industry Background and Trends
Despite the inherently conversational nature of influencer and content marketing as part of the broader integrated marketing landscape, many marketer budgets are currently allocated toward traditional display advertising and paid search, including banner ads and text links on social sites. While most marketers understand the value of word of mouth marketing, peer recommendations, and product reviews, the industry is nascent and few understand how to effectively and efficiently engage influencers and content creators and produce custom content appropriately for these purposes. Those who venture into this area without experience are often overwhelmed by the amount of effort and attention required to adequately manage and measure a truly integrated campaign that complies with applicable government regulations.
The influencer and content marketing categories have been limited primarily by the current inefficiencies of the market. Due to their large and highly fragmented nature, marketers have been forced to utilize a variety of highly inefficient sources and processes to navigate the complicated landscape, often resulting in low returns on their time investment or worse-yet, questionable results. We believe this is largely due to marketers and creators lacking an efficient way to identify and engage each other in the marketplace. 
At the same time, influencers and content creators that would like to monetize their community and work product are faced with significant challenges in making marketers aware of their services and in finding quality marketers who are motivated to sponsor them. In addition, those creators with smaller networks simply lack the individual influence and audience needed to warrant the processing of a micro-transaction. In many cases, it costs a marketer more money to issue a check to a small creator than the value of the sponsorship payment itself. Further complicating the sponsorship process for both parties are FTC regulations around social media endorsements, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) tax reporting generally applicable to anyone receiving income for services, and the associated campaign tracking required to provide compliance. While many marketers would prefer to be “part of the conversation,” we believe the complexity and cost of individual sponsorship often deters them from doing so.
We believe that the current challenges in efficiency and measurable success represent a significant opportunity for us. We address these challenges with targeted, scalable marketplaces that aggregate content creators and marketers. In doing so, we offer an efficient, innovative way for creators and marketers of all sizes to find each other and form a compensated relationship.
Since our inception in 2006, we have worked diligently to establish and leverage key strengths in our business model, including:
A culture of innovation and creativity. We believe the only way to survive and thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. We are in a state of constant evolution and re-invention; this is “The IZEA Way.” We have created a culture committed to innovation and creativity that challenges convention and breaks new ground. IZEA team members are 
2

protective and proud of our culture by applying its “humble, yet hungry” attitude to all facets of our business. Our people and their innovations ultimately provide us with our largest competitive advantage. 
First-mover advantage with a highly disruptive business model. We believe that by pioneering the social sponsorship space and investing heavily in innovation, acquisitions and marketing, we were first to develop positive rapport among creators and marketers alike. This loyalty has resulted in consistent revenue growth and high levels of repeat business.
Scalable and leverageable operations. Our business model allows revenue to be derived in a variety of ways, all of which rely on our marketplace as a hub. We continue to introduce and innovate product offerings within IZEAx to substantially decrease our operations and support expense over time as revenue grows.
Experienced management team, board of directors, and strategic advisors. Our management team includes not only a highly experienced team of entrepreneurs and executives from the digital media, technology and entertainment industries, but also outstanding board members who are experts in their respective fields. See Item 10 under Part III of this Annual Report for details.
Our Growth Strategy 
After eleven years of working in and developing the influencer and content marketing categories, we believe our business model is market-tested. Our development efforts have included assembling a diverse and experienced senior management team and engineering team, launching and optimizing our proprietary marketplaces, developing a cross-platform sales force and refining our message to the market. Key elements of our strategy to accelerate revenue growth and continue product development include: 
An integrated approach. We believe we are the only company that can currently provide both custom content creation and influencer marketing at scale. It is our opinion that this provides a significant advantage for us in the market and we have already seen strong sales response to proposals that include both content and sponsored social. Moving forward we believe that this integrated approach will continue to play a significant role in IZEA’s growth.
Large client services team. We expect the growth of our client development team to be the primary driver of near-term revenues. We intend to add additional client development personnel to more effectively service customers throughout North America. These individuals will be based across our various offices in the Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto metro areas. 
Large network of users. We help power the creator economy, allowing everyone from college students and stay-at-home individuals to celebrities and accredited journalists the opportunity to monetize their content, creativity and influence through our marketers. As of December 31, 2017, we had more than 729,000 user accounts in IZEAx. These accounts have connections to over 920,000 social media accounts with an approximate aggregate reach to 5.9 billion non-unique fans and followers of IZEAx creators. Our total number of user accounts may be higher than the number of our actual individual creators because some creators may have created multiple user accounts. 
Creators are able to join our platforms for free, but they may also pay to upgrade their account to enable additional services. The creators are compensated by IZEA for producing content for our marketers or distributing such content on behalf of marketers through their personal websites, blogs, and social media channels. We continually seek for ways to increase the ability for our creators to generate revenue. As such, we implement the ability for them to earn referral fees, for a period of time, based on revenue generated by other creators they refer into IZEAx. 
 By developing our creator network, we make our marketplace more attractive to our marketers who seek a wide variety of creators to fulfill their content and advertising needs. As marketers utilize our marketplace to a greater extent, we expect to increase the monetization opportunities for creators, which should, in turn, attract even more creators and further enhance value for our marketers. 
Strategic partnerships. We are working to improve functionality within IZEAx to create strategic partnerships and reseller agreements with companies that can provide additional growth in our base of creators and marketers. IZEAx is designed to be easily “white labeled,” allowing partners to operate their own “node” on the exchange. IZEAx is also designed to be licensed by partners that do not require a custom-branded solution, but instead seek an internal workflow tool to manage and service their content and marketing needs. 
3

Product development. We will continue to recruit additional engineering and product innovation team members to enhance IZEAx to develop new technology ideas within this platform that complement our mission as a company. In 2018, we intend to release version 3.0 of IZEAx, which will allow marketers to make offers that require a single creator to complete multiple tasks or deliverables and it will also allow the system to source multiple creators to produce a combined deliverable for the marketer.
Accretive acquisitions. We continually seek to identify and acquire companies, technologies, and assets to add to our portfolio of software services that will drive additional near and long-term revenue. In January 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Ebyline, and in July 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of ZenContent. The purposes of the acquisitions were to integrate their proprietary technologies and to add custom content services in addition to our existing influencer marketing services.
Sales and Marketing
We primarily sell sponsored social and custom content campaigns through our sales team, our platforms and, to a lesser extent, through distribution relationships such as resellers, affiliates and white label partners. We target regional, national and global brands and advertising agencies in the following ways:
Client Development Team.  We have a client development team each of whom is assigned a geographic region or specific marketers, primarily within the United States and Canada. The team members are responsible for identifying and managing sales opportunities to brands and agencies who are seeking to outsource some or all of the planning and production of their content and advertising needs.
Partnership Team.  The partnership team initiates software as a service (“SaaS”) license opportunities with brands and agencies who seek to utilize additional functionality on our platforms on a self-service basis to facilitate custom content and influencer marketing campaigns.
Industry Acumen. Our team possesses a strong marketing and advertising background. We focus our corporate marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating each of our platform advantages, generating qualified leads for our sales team and growing our creator network. Our corporate marketing plan is designed to continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for social sponsorship. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including tradeshows, third-party social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), IZEA-hosted community events, paid searches, content marketing, influencer marketing and our corporate websites.
Customers and Revenue
We derive revenue from managing content services or advertising campaigns for our customers, as well as from making our platforms available to allow customers the ability to purchase content directly from our creators. We categorize our revenue by three primary revenue streams: revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing or amplification services (“Managed Services”), revenue from transactions generated by the self-service use of our platforms by marketers to handle their content workflow from initial content request to payment of content received or distributed (“Content Workflow”), and revenue derived from various service and license fees charged to users of our platforms (“Service Fee Revenue”). 
We provide services to customers in multiple industry segments, including consumer products, retail/e-tail, lifestyle, technology, and travel. Our business serves advertising and public relations agencies, as well as brands and businesses directly. In many cases, influencer marketing dollars flow through the advertising or public relations agency, even when we have a direct relationship with the brand. 
We generate the majority of our revenue from our Managed Services customers. Managed Services accounted for approximately 98%, 96% and 95% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Content Workflow accounted for approximately 1%, 2% and 3% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Service Fee Revenue accounted for approximately 1%, 2% and 2% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 

Changes in how we control and manage our platforms, our contractual terms, our business practices, or other changes in accounting standards or interpretations, may change the reporting of our revenue. Effective January 1, 2018, we became subject to new guidelines for disclosing and accounting for our revenue from contracts with customers. See “Note 1. Summary 
4

of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information as it relates to our revenue recognition policies.
Our customers are predominantly located in the United States and Canada. We had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, one customer that accounted for 11% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, and one customer that accounted for 12% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Revenue from our Canadian customers accounted for approximately $2.0 million (8%) and $800,000 (4%) of our revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Technology 
IZEAx spans multiple social networks and creator-owned blog websites. We aggregate creators in IZEAx, which allows us to create scale and targeting for marketers. We provide the ability to target our creators based on a variety of software rules and filters. We provide self-service platforms that service all business types and sizes. Unlike a traditional public relations model, marketers only pay for completed posts. We provide trackable results by automatically embedding tracking links and pixels, as well as support, for third-party tracking (such as DART). We also provide dashboards for real-time reporting and immediate feedback. 
We recently announced a new research and development initiative focused on incorporating cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies into our ecosystem. We currently maintain a small alt-coin mining operation using an assortment of GPU and CPU hardware. In 2018, we developed a CPU mining software application that could pool our creator network's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. However, due to increasing financial, legal and regulatory uncertainty, we have decided not to release our mining software to the public at this time.
Privacy and Security
We are committed to protecting the privacy, reputations and dignity of our marketers and creators. Accordingly, we have invested heavily in many areas to prevent the misuse of information that we collect. Any personally identifiable information that we collect is used in accordance with our Privacy Policy, and we employ reasonable and suitable physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to protect such information. 
Product Development
Our product development team is responsible for platform and infrastructure development, application development, user interface and application design, enterprise connectivity, Internet applications and design, quality assurance, documentation and release management. One of our core strengths is our knowledge of and experience in launching and operating scalable content and influencer marketing marketplaces. Our product development expenses include salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock­-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to our development team along with hosting and software subscription costs. These costs were approximately $3,214,000, $3,134,000, and $2,249,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively and included in general and administrative expense. 
We launched IZEAx in March 2014 and unveiled our latest version 2.0 of the platform in February 2017. We continue to add new features and additional functionality to this platform each year. These new features will enable our platform to facilitate the contracting, workflow, and delivery of direct content as well as provide for invoicing, collaborating and direct payments for our SaaS customers. We incurred and capitalized software development costs of $174,379, $471,219, and 452,571 in our balance sheet during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Our team believes that constant innovation is the only way to achieve long-term growth and our intention is to focus the majority of our engineering resources on the IZEAx platform for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to invest in the creation of new technology additions that complement our core offerings. 
Competition 
We face competition from multiple companies in the influencer and content marketing categories. Direct and indirect competitors in the influencer marketing space include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, BlogHer, TapInfluence and Collective Bias. We also face competition in the content marketing space from companies such as Contently, NewsCred and Scripted. In addition, there are a number of traditional advertising agencies, public relations firms and niche consultancies that provide content development and conduct manual influencer outreach programs.
5

Competition could result in significant price competition, declining margins and reductions in advertising revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services with IZEAx, we may compete with a greater number of other companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
We also compete with traditional advertising media such as direct mail, television, radio, cable and print for a share of marketers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. 
Proprietary Rights
Proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. To evolve and secure our proprietary rights, we rely on intellectual property and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned 31 domestic trademark registrations in the United States, 15 foreign registrations on the International Register, and had 4 total pending applications (3 in the United States and 1 foreign). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we abandoned 13 U.S. applications and inactive trademarks. As of December 31, 2017, we also owned approximately 470 domain names related to the various aspects of IZEA’s products and services.
We actively protect our intellectual property rights, but have encountered challenges following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014) and Intellectual Ventures I LLC vs. Symantec Corp. (Fed. Cir. 2016), which changed the patent environment for software-based applications. As a result, given the difficulty in overcoming U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejections of certain of our pending patent applications, management decided not to actively pursue, at this time, patent protection for our software-based applications. We met with similar resistance in seeking patent protection for our software-based applications internationally. However, we retain our pending foreign patent application in Brazil. 
We cannot provide any assurance that our proprietary rights with respect to our products or services will be viable or have value in the future since the validity, enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect us from the infringement or misappropriation of such rights by others.
Further, in recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly in the software and Internet-related industries. We can and have been subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and could divert management's attention from operating our business. If we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted by regulators or in the courts in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, creator privacy, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other 
6

communications, consumer protection, the provision of various online payment services, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not entirely clear how existing laws which govern issues such as property ownership, taxation, export or import matters and personal privacy apply to the Internet, as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platforms or may even attempt to completely block access to our platforms. Accordingly, adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data. Many U.S. states have passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personally identifiable data. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection. In addition, data protection laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States can be more restrictive than those within the United States, and the interpretation and application of these laws are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change and/or abandon certain of our then-existing data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for linking to third-party websites that contain materials that infringe copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
We, as an e-commerce service provider are subject to FTC and various state rules and regulations on advertising and marketing on the Internet. In certain cases, we are retained by marketers to manage their advertising campaigns through our platforms, thereby increasing our exposure as not only the service provider but also the medium through which advertisements are broadcast. In addition to those requirements, the marketers, creators, and agencies that use our platforms are subject to specific guidance and regulations regarding online advertising, such as the FTC's Dot Com Disclosures - Information about Online Advertising, the FTC’s Enforcement Policy Statement on Deceptively Formatted Advertisements, issued in 2015, and the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (known as the Guides) that were adopted in 2009, updated and reissued by the FTC in 2013, and further clarified in 2015. Each of the foregoing are sub-categories that have been taken up by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”) to prevent “unfair or deceptive acts and practices” within advertising. These new Guides, for example, significantly extend the scope of potential liability associated with the use of testimonials and endorsements, including injecting endorsement requirements into advertising methods such as blogging, posting on Instagram, tweeting, and other online posting of sponsored advertisements by a creator. In particular, the Guides provide that creators must always clearly and conspicuously disclose the material connection between the creator and the marketer, such as if they received consideration for blogging or posting about a particular product, service, brand or the like, whether the consideration comprises something tangible (i.e. cash, discounts, objects that are provided to them at no cost, even for testing purposes) or intangible (such as accolades and more prominent future blogging or posting opportunities). In addition, the creator must not make claims about the product or service he or she is discussing that go beyond what the marketer could say about the product or service. The Guides further provide that the marketer should ensure that creators speaking on its behalf are provided guidance and training needed to ensure their claims, statements and representations are truthful, transparent and properly substantiated, and monitor the activities of creators speaking on its behalf. In the event a creator, blogger, agency or marketer should fail to comply with the Dot Com Disclosures, the Guides or any other FTC rule, regulation or policy, which may be manifest by making deceptive, misleading or unsubstantiated claims and representations, failing to disclose a sponsorship relationship or otherwise, then various parties related to the advertising campaign (including the service provider of the platform over which the campaign is managed) may be subject to liability as a result of such non-compliance. In the event it was found that we (or one of our marketer customers) failed to comply with the FTC Act or state advertising rules, it could result in the potential imposition of equitable redress or penalties that could include monetary damages, a modification of certain business practices, or an order to cease certain aspects of our operations.
More generally, if there is negative consumer perception and mistrust of the practice of compensating creators to endorse the marketers' specific products, then marketers may become less interested in using influencer marketing platforms like ours as a means for advertising which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business and financial results.

We follow the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive with regard to data we collect from users located in the European Union and we are currently monitoring changes required by the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), to ensure that we are compliant with relevant requirements when and to the extent they are implemented. The GDPR updates and modernizes the principles of the 1995 Data Protection Directive and significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance. The European Union data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the data controller's or data processor's total worldwide global turnover for 
7

the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. We believe that the regulation should not have a material impact on our business or the way our technologies operate. However, interpretations of the GDPR may vary, especially with respect to the conditions for collection of a valid "non-ambiguous" consent, and thus there can be no assurance that this will be the case. The regulation will be enforced after a two-year transition period beginning May 25, 2018.
We are committed to promoting ethical social sponsorship practices and have established terms of service for users of our platforms, which refer to the FTC Guides and include one or more of the following:
Mandatory Disclosure. We mandate disclosure of the sponsored relationship between the marketer and creator. A sponsorship cannot be published through the platform unless a phrase or paragraph disclosing the sponsored relationship is included. For example, a creator is required to select one of a number of disclosure phrases such as “sponsored,” “advertisement” or “ad” prior to the publication of a tweet or a post. Other social sponsorship forms may be monitored through a Disclosure Audit tool that monitors posts on an ongoing basis to make sure they continue to include disclosure after the initial posts are approved. Failure to disclose the sponsored relationship is a violation of our terms of service, which may result in the withholding of payment for the sponsorship and the creator being removed from our network.
Freedom of Choice. Creators are free to choose which sponsorships to publish. Our platforms do not auto-inject a marketer's message into an influencer's social media network.
Authentic Voice. We encourage honesty of opinion in the selection of sponsorships by a creator and similarly we encourage marketers to create opportunities that allow the creator to write the sponsorship in their own words, provided that a creator always adheres to our terms of service and code of ethics which includes disclosing their sponsored relationships at all times while using any of the platforms.
Transparency of Identity. Our platforms are designed to be open, safe environment for our marketers, creators and users. In fact, we do not cloak the identities of marketers or creators. Both parties involved in a potential transaction can see each other's profiles and make informed decisions before engaging with each other.
Pre-Publication Marketer Review.  Marketers may choose to review their sponsored content before it is published and to request a change to the sponsored content prior to publication in the case of factual inaccuracies.
Reporting Violations.  We have zero tolerance for violations of our terms of service and encourage the reporting of violations directly to IZEA. If violations are reported, we promptly investigate them and in appropriate cases, marketers, creators and users are removed from our network and prohibited from using our sites. In addition, we take an active role in reporting spam accounts to Twitter and Facebook.
We also believe, and have subsequently included requirements within our terms of service, based on positions taken by certain federal courts and the FTC, that communications and messages disseminated by creators through social media networks are subject to and must comply at all times with CAN-SPAM Act of 2003(Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) requirements.
To date, we have not been materially impacted by the rules governing messaging over social media networks and social sponsorship, including the CAN-SPAM Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. However, we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on us and marketers and creators who use our platforms, nor can we predict the impact of attempts to circumvent our mechanisms that are designed to ensure compliance.
Employees
As of April 13, 2018, we had a total of 125 employees, of which 124 were full-time employees, including 53 in sales and marketing, 27 in campaign fulfillment, 27 in technology and development and 17 in administration and finance. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineers, sales and marketing, account management, and senior management personnel.
