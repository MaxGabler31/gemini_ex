Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Remitly Global,” “Remitly,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Remitly Global, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 
Overview
Remitly was founded in 2011 to transform the lives of immigrants and their families by providing the most trusted financial services on the planet. 
The inspiration behind Remitly came when Matt, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, was living and working in Kenya. There, Matt realized how challenging it was for families to send and receive money to and from their loved ones while overseas – the process was painful, opaque, and expensive. This first-hand look at cross-border remittances was an eye-opener, and Matt became convinced there was a better way. In 2011, Josh and Shivaas, our two other co-founders, joined Matt to start Remitly and began working on the problem. Their goal was to make a difference for immigrant communities by using technology to disrupt traditional cross-border remittances.
Today, Remitly is a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families in over 150 countries around the world. We remain committed to our vision of transforming the lives of immigrants and their families by providing the most trusted financial services on the planet. The long-term, trusted relationships we foster with our customers have enabled us to expand our core cross-border remittance product to over 2,100 corridors worldwide and we are now working to extend our offering to a broader suite of financial services.
Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. They are primarily immigrants from developing countries who have moved away from their families to seek new opportunities and build a better life for themselves and their loved ones. While our customers may be physically distant, they remain closely connected with and deeply committed to their family and friends back home – often sending money home multiple times per month. Through their individual experiences, they help us define how we design and build best-in-class services. Our relentless focus on our customers underpins our commitment to do everything in our power to ensure their hard-earned money reaches their families back home. 
Our Culture
Our culture and values act as a blueprint for how we get things done. As noted above, the one constant, and single most important of these values is customer centricity, which serves as our north star in all that we do. To us, customer centricity means “we are here to listen to, learn from, and serve our customers. Period.” 
Our other core values fall broadly into three categories:
•Our purpose: Aim for the stars, be an owner, hire and develop exceptional people, don’t be afraid to fail and be joyful;
•Building relationships: Lead authentically, act with integrity, be constructively direct, and be an empathetic partner; and
•Taking action: Have a bias for action, be data-driven, sweat the details, deliver on promises, and continuously improve.
These values influence our actions every day. Living up to our values builds customer trust, inspires employee engagement, and makes “Promises Delivered” our fundamental ethos.
2021 Key Performance Metrics
The vast majority of our revenue today is generated through our remittance business, where we earn revenue from transaction fees charged to customers and foreign exchange spreads applied to the customer’s principal. In addition to our financial results, we regularly review key business metrics to evaluate our performance. These key business metrics include active customers, send volume, and average revenue per active customer. 
Our 2021 key performance metrics included the following results: 
•Active customers for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased to 2.8 million, from 1.9 million, up 50% year over year.
•Send volume for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to over $20.4 billion, from $12.1 billion, up 70% year over year.
•Average revenue per active customer for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 13% year over year to $47.69.
We regularly review these key business metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in 
Table of Contents

assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of these key business metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, analysts, or investors.
The key business metrics that we use to measure the performance of our business are defined as follows:
•“Active customers” is defined as the number of distinct customers that have successfully completed at least one transaction using Remitly during a given calendar quarter. We identify customers through unique account numbers. 
•“Send volume” is defined as the sum of all customer’s principal, measured in U.S. dollars, related to transactions completed during a given period. The customer’s principal is net of cancellations, does not include transaction fees from customers, and does not include any credits, offers, or bonuses applied to the transaction by us.
•“Average revenue per active customer” is calculated by taking revenue for the quarter, divided by quarterly active customers.
As active customers are measured on a quarterly basis, the data for the full-year periods for active customers and average revenue per active customer is not meaningful, and therefore both metrics are only presented on a quarterly basis herein.
Our Services
Our journey began in digital cross-border remittances, and we continue to evolve and develop a portfolio of broader financial services. We designed and built a mobile-centric suite of products to address our customers’ discrete financial services needs, many of which are not met by legacy institutions. 
Digital Cross-Border Remittances
We provide a digital cross-border remittance product that is accessible via our mobile app or the web. Our customers are able to set up an account and start sending money to international recipients on our platform without visiting physical agents, generally within minutes. Recipients can receive funds in multiple ways using our diversified and global disbursement network. Our customers and their families can also track the status of their transactions in real time. Today, over 90% of our customers engage with us via our mobile app, shifting what traditionally required waiting in line to speak with an agent to the palm of their hands. Providing our customers with a convenient, easy, and safe mobile experience underpins our approach to product development, marketing, and customer success. 
Historically and at the present time, substantially all of our revenue is generated from digital cross-border remittances. 
Remitly for Developers
We serve business customers through Remitly for Developers, our remittance-as-a-service offering that strategically leverages our custom-built global network and compliance and regulatory infrastructure. With Remitly for Developers, businesses and their developers can integrate this network and infrastructure into their existing applications and websites through our APIs, in exchange for fees and foreign exchange markups paid to us by our business customers to utilize our network. This enables them to offer digital cross-border payments to their customers in emerging markets. 
Digital Banking Services
In partnership with Sunrise Banks N.A (“Sunrise”), we launched Passbook, a digital banking service available through a mobile app and uniquely designed for immigrants. Passbook promotes financial access by giving our customers a new way to store, spend and send money in a manner that is secure and compliant. With Passbook, our customers have access to banking services that don’t require them to pay account or international transaction fees, and they can personalize their Visa debit cards. With tailored Know Your Customer (“KYC”) and identity verification processes using our existing technology platform, they can sign up for a Passbook account in under ten minutes. We generate revenue through interchange fees from the bank partners to whom we market these financial services.
Technology 
Our Technology Platform
Our technology platform is purpose-built to power our mobile-centric suite of products, connect our global network, localize our marketing, products and experiences, and drive our data-driven approach. 
Given the scale of our business and the complexity of digital cross-border payments, our technology platform has broad and complex capabilities and, together with our data, gives us a unique advantage in understanding our customers. Our technology platform is comprised of the following:
•Core transaction engine that underpins the entire transaction lifecycle from pricing and foreign currency, to funding, processing, and, ultimately, to disbursement;
•Customer experience engine with corridor-specific user journeys and multilingual self-service or real-time support; 
•Disbursement system for partner integrations that supports a diverse set of delivery methods for recipients in over 135 countries; 
Table of Contents

•Marketing technology stack that enables our marketing team to efficiently operate and improve the quality of our customer experiences by supporting our localization strategies and efficiently capturing and analyzing data to ensure maximum long-term return on our marketing investments; and
•Our electronic KYC, machine learning-based fraud scoring and payment authentication processes that all take place in real-time to give our customers immediate feedback and are in compliance with highly complex and continuously evolving global and local regulations.
Customer Experience
We strive to optimize customer experience and to make each interaction on our mobile app intuitive and as friction-free as possible. New customers who have their information at hand can initiate a transaction in just minutes after setting up their account and adding their recipient’s information. Below are the key steps of a transaction from account log-in to transaction confirmation.
•Account set-up and log-in. Customers can quickly set up an account on our app by entering their relevant personal information and documentation in a way that is designed to be secure. They then link their choice of payment methods including their bank account, credit card or debit card, and certain alternative payment methods. We also employ biometric login to reduce ongoing password friction. Our customers enjoy increased security and a faster way to access their transactions.
•Choose the recipient. Our customers can send to an unlimited number of recipients, and adding new ones is easy. To add a new recipient, the customer simply fills in the key information necessary for them to receive funds. The recipient's details only need to be entered one time, making repeat transactions quick and easy.
•Speed of delivery. In the vast majority of our customers’ transactions, after selecting their recipient, our customers have the flexibility to select the delivery speed within the product. Our express option optimizes for speed by leveraging our customer’s debit or credit card payment methods while our economy option delivers within a few days and allows customers to optimize for price.
•Delivery method. Our global network of partners allows us to offer a rich selection of digital delivery methods, including bank deposits and mobile wallets as well as traditional delivery methods such as cash pickup, where a recipient can conveniently collect the money sent at a nearby location using a picture ID and a transaction reference number. We also offer the convenience of home delivery in certain markets to further extend the accessibility of our customers’ recipients. 
•Transaction confirmation. We provide peace of mind with our Perfect Delivery Promise, which includes a projection of the exact date and time for delivery of funds. In addition, we believe we are the only scaled provider in the remittance market to provide a money back guarantee on timely delivery, a feature we are incredibly proud to stand behind. Both our customer and the recipient receive notifications at key stages of the transaction process, including initiation and completion. Our customers also receive a transparent breakdown of their transaction costs. 
We invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of our customers’ needs, and we continually innovate to deliver value-added products and services through our platform. We therefore have significant resources dedicated to technology and development across multiple teams including product, engineering, design, analytics, compliance, marketing, and customer service. These teams are responsible 
Table of Contents

for the design, development, and testing of our platform and services. We focus the majority of our investment on developing new functionality and further enhancing the usability, reliability, and performance of our platform and services.
Our Network 
Our global network of funding and disbursement partners is at the core of our business. Over the last decade, we have strategically expanded our network in existing corridors to provide our customers with increasing disbursement options and in new corridors as part of our expansion strategy. Our partners, including those that are among the most trusted and recognized brands around the world, create a broad and effective payment acceptance (pay-in) and payment delivery (pay-out) ecosystem for our customers:
•Payment acceptance. We have relationships with top tier banks including Barclays, Chase, HSBC, and Wells Fargo, and leading global payment processors including a direct relationship with Visa. These relationships provide our customers an array of payment (or pay-in) options to fund remittances with a bank account, card-based payment, or alternative payment method.
We can accept and settle transfers from hundreds of millions of consumer bank accounts as well as Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards in the 17 send countries we operate in today. As a digital service, we do not have sending agents who accept cash. We, in turn, do not incur costs or commissions associated with physical agent-based sending and funding. 
•Payment delivery. We have access to over 3,600 global disbursement partners including major banks, cash pick-up and mobile wallet partners. These relationships provide our customers with choice of delivery and enable us to send funds within minutes, or even seconds, to more than 3.7 billion bank accounts, over 670 million mobile wallets and alternative payment methods, and approximately 390,000 cash pickup locations (including retail outlets and banks).
We select our disbursement partners based on our recipients’ preferences, quality of service, brand recognition, and co-branding opportunities. Our disbursement partners make us a trusted source of remittances because our customers are typically already familiar with their chosen disbursement partner and recipients feel comfortable receiving money where they regularly bank or shop. In addition, we only select disbursement partners that meet or exceed: (1) our geographic coverage goals in the markets in which they operate, (2) our robust compliance and regulatory requirements, and (3) our specific operating metrics such as credit worthiness and error rates.
Certain of our funding and disbursement partnerships are multi-faceted. For example, a bank can be a payment processor who helps Remitly facilitate payment acceptance, a settlement bank where Remitly deposits customer funds for payment delivery, or a corporate bank providing certain services such as treasury and cash management. In addition, we have redundancies built into our global network for our various partnerships.
Today, our customers primarily send money from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other countries in Europe, Singapore and Australia. Our customers’ recipients are located in over 135 countries around the world; our largest receive countries include Mexico, the Philippines, and India.
What Sets Us Apart
Our Core Pillars 
Our brand promise is to bring “peace of mind” into everything we do. We focus on bringing trust, reliability, and a fair and transparent price to cross-border remittances and broader financial services.
To deliver on our brand promise, we have a differentiated approach that aligns with the specific needs and interests of our customers and solves the problems immigrant communities often face in making remittances. There are four core elements to our differentiated approach:
•Providing a Simple and Reliable Way of Sending Money with Our Mobile-Centric Suite of Products. Today, over 90% of our customers engage with Remitly on their mobile phones, shifting what traditionally required an in-person interaction, including waiting in line to speak with an agent, to the palm of their hands. Our mobile app currently has a 4.9 iOS App Store rating with more than 650,000 reviewers and a 4.8 Android Google Play rating with more than 325,000 reviewers. We have achieved this level of engagement and these high ratings by designing mobile-centric products that make the customer experience simple and convenient and give our customers complete peace of mind. 
Our mobile app for cross-border remittances provides an easy-to-use, end-to-end process. In just a few minutes, customers are able to set up and send money for the first time with Remitly, and repeat transactions become easier with just five taps. Our customers and their families can also track the status of their transactions in real time. This mobile-centric experience enables us to engage beyond the initial transaction, generating strong repeat usage and high customer loyalty. 
•Conveniently Putting Money Safely in the Hands of Our Customers’ Families, Wherever They Are, by Relying on Our Global Network. Our global network of funding and disbursement partnerships enables us to complete money transfers in over 2,100 corridors without the need to deploy local operations in each country. We are able to do this while complying with global and local licensing and regulatory requirements. A corridor represents the pairing of a send country, from which a customer can send a remittance, with a specific receive country to which such remittance can be sent.
Table of Contents

We have partner relationships with global banks and leading payment providers to give our customers an array of payment (or pay-in) options, including with a bank account, card-based payments and alternative payment methods. Our disbursement network provides our customers with various digital and traditional delivery methods and enables us to send (or payout) funds within minutes to more than 3.7 billion bank accounts, over 670 million mobile wallets, and approximately 390,000 cash pickup locations. These partner relationships help drive a better customer experience, including faster transfers, higher acceptance rates, and enhanced reliability.
•Creating Trusted and Personalized Experiences with Our Localization Expertise at Scale. We believe our expertise in localizing our marketing, products, and customer support at scale is a key differentiator and enables us to provide customers with a personalized experience that drives peace of mind. Localization can mean many things. To us, it means speaking with our customers in their preferred language, reaching them through the media channels they frequent, and being culturally relevant through their journey. While our business is global, we recognize the importance of a culturally relevant experience being delivered to our customers and their families in the many countries we serve. We strive to deliver marketing, product, and support experiences that connect with them in meaningful ways. For example, we tailor our customer experience with 14 native languages, and we provide peace of mind with our global customer support team. Additionally, for disbursement of funds, we partner with local brands that are among the most trusted and recognized by our customers and their families.
•Using Our Data-Driven Approach to Better Serve Our Customers and Provide More Value. We have a data-driven approach to how we grow our business, prioritize our investments, and manage our operations. Because our customers initiate transfers digitally, we capture and leverage a body of transaction-related data that provides insight into customer behavior and customer experience. This data and the analytics we perform inform our marketing investments and product development prioritization. In addition, we leverage our data platform and proprietary models to improve our compliance systems and manage pricing, treasury, fraud risk, and customer support. 
Strategy
We operate in a large and fragmented market. Based on estimates from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the market for global money transfers was estimated to be approximately $1.6 trillion in total migrant remittance volume in 2021 (including both formal and informal person-to-person channels), and has been growing at over a 5% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, with digital volumes significantly outpacing the rest of the market. In our core serviceable available market, remittance flows to developing countries were expected to reach $589 billion in 2021, according to the World Bank in November 2021. To contextualize the size and importance of this market, according to the United Nations, global remittances are over two times larger than the amount of official development assistance. 
As of December 31, 2021, we captured approximately 1% of the total migrant remittance inflow volume. We believe that we can capture a larger share of this market. We also believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to significantly expand our total addressable market by leveraging our trusted brand to offer a broader set of financial services to the 280 million global immigrants and their families.
Our approach to achieving these goals has been rooted from Day 1 in customer centricity, which means deeply understanding our customers’ unique and local needs to provide them with a differentiated experience in remittances and broader financial services. Strategically managing the business from this perspective has been key to our success since the very beginning and forms the frame for the remainder of our strategy, which includes the following focus areas:
•Gain share in existing corridors. 
◦Grow our customer base. We plan on expanding our marketing efforts across existing corridors to increase brand awareness with customers and highlight the value of our products and services. We believe this will attract new customers to try Remitly. As we grow our customer base, we expect to benefit from increased operating leverage in the business and more data and insight to enhance our models.
◦Increase customer engagement and drive repeat use. The majority of our customers use our products and services multiple times per month. To further strengthen our customer relationships and brand loyalty, we will continue to enhance our products and services and develop new features to tailor and personalize our customers’ experiences, as we continue to learn what our customers need, in order to optimize our pricing and delivery options. We will also continue to establish new disbursement partnerships and add new payment methods to enhance our cross-border payment remittance experience for current and potential customers in our existing corridors. We expect these initiatives will attract new customers and retain existing customers while leading to larger and more frequent transactions across our growing customer base.
•Expand to new corridors and partner networks. While our global network spans across more than 2,100 corridors around the world, we have plans to increase our reach to thousands of additional corridors. We see an opportunity to generate value by expanding our remittance services more broadly in this way. We expect to leverage our data-driven approach to optimize our pricing, product features, marketing strategies, and customer economics as we expand and grow in these new geographies. Additionally, we expect to leverage our localization expertise and our technology platform to grow the number of disbursement, payment and other partners in our global network and increase the number of direct integrations with such partners. 
•Continue expanding into broader financial services. We believe there are enormous opportunities to create a more inclusive financial system that not only encompasses, but caters to the needs of immigrants. We are pursuing these opportunities in two ways. 
Table of Contents

First, we are using the insights we gain about immigrant customers through our data-driven platform to develop broader financial services and service expansions, such as Passbook and Remitly For Developers. We will continue to invest in our platform in this way, expanding our product and service offerings and our overall technological lead to actualize our opportunities in this area. For example, our Passbook app started with deposit services, and we also plan to build new products and features within the app to provide solutions to a broader array of our customers’ financial services needs.
Second, we will also continue to leverage our global network and infrastructure. We believe that empowering businesses to build on top of our leading distribution and compliance infrastructure, such as through Remitly For Developers, attracts a new set of potential customers and expands economic opportunities in developing markets.
•Pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions. While our main growth strategy has historically been organic, we may selectively pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions to accelerate our growth objectives or to enhance our competitive position within existing and new products and markets. For example, in 2021, we extended our partnership with Visa by integrating Visa Direct within our global network, providing our customers with real-time cross-border payments options to more countries around the world. We also acquired a software engineering practice and concluded a second strategic partnership with Coinbase in 2021.
Competition
We operate in a large and highly fragmented market. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience competition from a number of companies, including those who are well-established and may have greater resources, and those who may become meaningful competitors in the future. Our diverse array of competitors generally falls into the following categories:
•Incumbent providers with a scaled legacy footprint. Traditional providers with large networks of brick-and-mortar locations and agents around the world that have been slow to adopt digital solutions. 
•Traditional banks. Traditional bank networks that offer a wide variety of financial services, including international remittances, but have limited disbursement options and may have burdensome KYC processes that do not cater to immigrant populations. 
•Digital-first cross-border payment providers. Digital-first providers of payments, money transfer and remittance products that aim to be convenient, transparent and affordable, with varying corridor-related focuses, such as developed-to-developing or developed-to-developed markets. 
•Emerging players focused on broader financial services. Online-only banks, cryptocurrency players, and other emerging players typically offer a subset of the financial services offered by traditional banks, and generally place a greater emphasis on convenience and user experience. 
•Informal person-to-person channels. Bringing cash home when immigrants travel, trusting others to deliver cash back home, established networks of “IOUs” based on documentation or passwords, and other systems of trust-based cash transfers that evade tracking and regulation.
Digital-first companies are increasingly gaining market share from legacy providers and traditional banks. We believe that the principal competitive factors across experience, product, network and technology include:
•Experience:
◦A trusted relationship with customers and their families
◦A simple and convenient customer experience 
◦Appealing to customers and their families on a hyper-local level
•Product:
◦Fair and transparent product pricing
◦Speed and certainty of transactions
◦Adjacent suite of digital-first financial services
◦Global and local customer service
•Network:
◦Breadth of global network, including a vast array of easy-to-access disbursement options
◦Ability to accept alternative payment methods
•Technology:
◦Technological differentiation through service availability, performance, scalability, and reliability
◦Efficient fraud, compliance, and regulatory management
◦Ability to innovate
By focusing on the unique needs of immigrants and having a relentless customer focus, we believe that we have built a differentiated and compelling value proposition, and that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.

Specifically, we believe that our mobile-centric suite of products, our vast global network, our localization expertise at scale, and our data driven approach create sustainable differentiation against competitors. 
Regulatory Environment 
Our business is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and international laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and conduct our activities, including (1) the jurisdictions from which our customers initiate transactions, the majority of which include the United States, Canada, European Economic Area (“EEA”), and the United Kingdom and/or (2) the jurisdictions in which recipients receive disbursements, the majority of which include Mexico, the Philippines, India and other developing countries. These laws and regulations include strict legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, data use, theft and misappropriation and other illicit activity. In addition, such requirements include laws and regulations regarding money transmission licensing, financial services, consumer disclosure and protection, foreign exchange, currency controls, unclaimed property, privacy, and cyber security. The laws and regulations applicable to our business in any given jurisdiction are extensive, complex, frequently changing, increasing in scope, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Legal and Compliance Risks.”
The description of a subset of these laws and regulations that follows is designed to be a summary and is not exhaustive. We have developed and implemented a compliance program, including our anti-money laundering program, comprised of policies and procedures designed to comply with such laws and regulations as they apply to our business. We also monitor these areas closely to continue to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current and evolving laws and regulations. 
Anti-Money Laundering. In the United States, our business is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as well as similar state laws and regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires companies engaged in money transmission to develop and maintain risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity, and collect and maintain personal information about consumers and all transaction records. These requirements may also apply to our distribution partners and sub-partners. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has interpreted the BSA to require money transmission companies to conduct due diligence and risk-based monitoring of their distribution partners. 
Similar anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations apply to our business internationally, including in the countries where we operate and those where we are licensed (Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore). These include laws and regulations to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, including obligations to collect and maintain information about our users, recordkeeping, reporting and due diligence, and supervision of agents and subagents similar to, and in some cases exceeding, those required under the BSA. We are also, to a lesser extent, impacted by laws and regulations in the other countries in which our disbursement partners operate.
As a money services business, we maintain a stringent AML compliance program that includes internal policies and controls, designation of AML compliance officers for each of our regulated subsidiaries, ongoing employee training and monitoring programs, and annual independent reviews. 
Sanctions. Our business must also comply with economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) in the United States, the Government of Canada and other sanctions authorities in those jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations prohibit or restrict transactions in, to or from certain countries, regions or governments, as well as with certain individuals and entities such as traffickers in illegal goods or services, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these economic and trade sanctions programs. These measures include, without limitation, screening certain transactions and customer information against OFAC and other international government watch-lists, blocking funds of OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (“SDNs”) and other persons and entities designated as prohibited persons by international sanctions authorities, including the U.S. Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty’s Treasury, and other relevant sanctions authorities, and preparing and submitting blocking and other reports as required by relevant authorities. 
Anti-Bribery. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) in the United States, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in Canada (“CFPOA”), the U.K. Bribery Act in the United Kingdom and similar laws in the other jurisdictions in which we or our disbursement partners operate, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of influencing official action or otherwise gaining an unfair business advantage, such as obtaining or retaining business. We maintain a compliance program designed to ensure our compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations.
Money Transmission and Stored Value Licensing or Registration. We are subject to licensing and registration requirements in relation to our money transmission and stored value issuance activities on a state by state and federal basis in the United States and in almost every other jurisdiction from which our customers initiate transactions, including the United States, Canada, the EEA, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore.
In the United States, we hold licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in 48 states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum net worth requirements, customer disclosure requirements, regulatory approval of directors and senior management of the licensed entity, anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, cybersecurity program requirements, and examination by state regulatory agencies. In connection with certain licenses we hold in the United States, there are also different shareholding thresholds (as low as 10% or more of the total equity in us) that may require a shareholder to obtain regulatory approval prior to exceeding such thresholds.
Table of Contents

Outside the United States, our money transmission business is subject to regulation in almost all of the countries and territories in which we offer those services. We are licensed or registered to operate our money transfer services in key jurisdictions including Canada, Ireland (that serves the EEA via the EU passporting process), the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore. This list is not exhaustive, as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that may assert jurisdiction over our international business activities.
Under these licensing regimes and associated regulations and supervision, we are subject to requirements such as capital and safeguarding rules, certain consumer protection requirements, IT, and operational security risk management requirements, outsourcing oversight requirements, and periodic regulatory examinations. In certain countries, we are able to serve our customers through the use of disbursement partners instead of obtaining our own license. These entities are typically locally licensed businesses or regulated banks whom we believe are compliant with local laws.
Unclaimed Property. We must also comply with unclaimed property laws in the United States and in other countries where we or our disbursement partners operate. These laws require us to remit to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers. We hold property subject to unclaimed property laws and we have an ongoing program designed to help us comply with these laws. We are subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices. 
Consumer Disclosure and Consumer Protection. We are subject to laws, regulations and disclosure requirements relating to consumer protection in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations, where such laws and regulations are enforced by numerous government agencies. In the U.S., the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) implements, examines compliance with, and enforces federal consumer protection laws governing financial products and services, including the Remittance Transfer Rule. The Remittance Transfer Rule requirements include (1) a disclosure requirement to provide consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced pre-transaction written disclosures; (2) an obligation to resolve certain errors, including errors that may be outside our control; and (3) an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a customer’s request. The CFPB has substantial rule-making and enforcement authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a financial product or service. As a larger participant in the market for international money transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. 
Indirect Regulatory Requirements. As a marketing agent for Sunrise for Passbook, a debit card-linked demand deposit account service offered and issued by Sunrise, we are indirectly subject to the oversight of the banking regulators of Sunrise and responsible for implementing certain aspects of Sunrise's AML program with respect to the Passbook service. We are also subject to U.S. state banking law that prohibits non-banks, including state-licensed money transmitters, from holding themselves out as banks, providing banking services, or marketing, advertising, or soliciting customers in any manner suggesting that we are a bank or engaged in banking services.
Certain of our Remitly For Developers customers may be subject to various regulations and compliance obligations, including those that relate to cryptocurrency, that do not apply directly to us but impact the services that we provide to our customers. In addition, based on our relationships with our disbursement partners, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by our disbursement partners' regulators.
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property and proprietary rights (“IP Rights”) are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish, maintain and protect our IP Rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. However, these laws, agreements, and procedures provide only limited protection. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned six U.S. registered trademarks, two pending U.S. trademark applications, 65 foreign registered trademarks and 61 pending foreign trademark applications covering the mark REMITLY, our collapsed Clasped Hand logo, REMITLY (+ Clasped Hand Logo), PASSBOOK BY REMITLY, and Hui Mei Yi (Remitly in Chinese characters). We are pursuing additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Additionally, we own common law trademark rights in the above-referenced marks as well as the REMITLY PROMISES DELIVERED (+ Clasped Hand Logo) and PASSBOOK BY REMITLY (+ Clasped Hand Logo) mark in the United States and certain other jurisdictions where common law rights are recognized. We also own several domain names, including www.remitly.com.
We monitor our trademarks and service marks through watch services which notify us when applications for potentially conflicting marks have been filed in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We also enforce our trademarks, service marks, trade names and domain names against infringing third-party trademarks, trade names and domain names by sending cease and desist letters, filing complaints, and commencing administrative, and other legal proceedings in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Although we take steps to protect our trademarks, service marks, trade names and domain names, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient to prevent others from using or seeking to register our trademarks, service marks, trade names and domain names. Additionally, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop services that compete with ours. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies or services that are competitive with ours or that infringe on, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our IP Rights. Policing the unauthorized use of our IP Rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any administrative or legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming, and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated.

We also rely upon a substantial amount of intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our services.
Although we rely on IP Rights, as well as contractual protections, in our business, we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our IP Rights through appropriate technological restrictions, such as physical and electronic security measures. It is also our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. The contractual provisions that we enter into with employees, consultants, disbursement partners, vendors, and customers, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. We also cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology or that our invention assignment agreements will be self-executing.
See Part I, Item 1. Business, in the section titled “Risk Factors—Intellectual Property, Technology, Privacy and Security Risks” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our IP Rights. 
Privacy and Cybersecurity
We collect, use, receive, store, transmit, disclose, and process a wide variety of data and information (including personal information and sensitive personal information) for various purposes in our business. This aspect of our business is subject to numerous industry standards, laws, rules and regulations in the United States and globally. Regulation and proposed regulation in this area has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to do so. Our data handling is also subject to contractual obligations.
In addition to numerous privacy and data protection laws already in place, U.S. states are increasingly adopting laws imposing comprehensive privacy and data protection obligations, which may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than foreign, federal, or other state laws, and such laws may differ from or conflict with each other.
In the U.S., various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became operative on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), recently was approved by California voters in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, and may create new obligations for us beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement commencing July 1, 2023. 
Internationally, many countries have established their own data privacy and security legal framework with which we, our customers and/or partners may need to comply. For example, in Europe, the GDPR took effect on May 25, 2018 and contains numerous requirements and changes from previously existing European law, including more robust obligations on data controllers and processors and more fulsome documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies. As a result of our presence in Europe and our service offering in the European Union, we are subject to the GDPR, which imposes stringent data protection and cybersecurity requirements, and could increase the risk of non-compliance and the costs of providing our services in a compliant manner. A breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, fines and sanctions, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action-type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to a “third country,” including the United States. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices.
Additionally, since December 31, 2020, we have been required to comply with both the GDPR and the Data Protection Act, with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million (£17 million) or 4% of global revenues. It is unclear how data transfers between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other jurisdictions will be treated, and the role of the United Kingdom’s supervisory authority is also unclear. 
There are a number of pending legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. We expect that our efforts to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA and other regulatory and legislative requirements will continue to require substantial investments, including investments in compliance processes and technical infrastructure. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing cybersecurity requirements, including requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. 
Additionally, the GLBA (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain

nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
Financial technology companies such as us are prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or to disrupt our ability to provide access to our products and services. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly phishing attacks), vendor errors, and general hacking have become more prevalent in the industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable accounts or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other objectionable ends. Cyber-attacks may cause interruptions to our platform, degrade the user experience, cause users to lose confidence and trust in our platform, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect company data or the information that we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve.
In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose information in order to gain access to our data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We are engaged in ongoing privacy and cybersecurity compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with the requirements of privacy and cybersecurity laws, and other industry standards, and regulatory and legislative requirements. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain and inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or obligations, or practices of the features of our services. This could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Human Capital
Our Team. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 1,800 full-time equivalent employees either working out of our headquarters in Seattle, Washington, at one of our seven other office locations around the world, or remotely. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe the positive relationship between our customers, our team members and our mission-oriented culture differentiates us and is a key driver of our business success. Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to deliver on our brand promise to customers and serve our other stakeholders. We are focused on supporting our employees from recruitment and onboarding, to ongoing development, and have implemented programs designed to support their development, engagement, and wellness. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) is deeply rooted in our purpose and mission at Remitly. Our focus every day is to tirelessly deliver for our customers, many of whom may be underrepresented in the countries they've migrated to and have historically been left out of traditional financial systems. Effectively serving millions of customers sending money home to their families in over 135 different countries requires teams of committed individuals who demonstrate a deep level of empathy, genuine curiosity, value varied lived experiences, perspectives and backgrounds and appreciate the different ways we all think, process, present, and operate. Remitly’s working environment and culture are designed to unlock our employees’ best thinking and inspire impact from our diverse teams. All of this is made clear by the way we live our cultural values, as we engage with each other, our customers and the immigrant communities we serve all over the world. 
To ensure we create an inclusive culture that embraces the diversity of our employees, we have invested in resources and created programs that encourage continuous learning and constructive dialogue at all levels of our organization, such as executive members co-hosting multiple DEI monthly meetings with our Vice President of Environment Social Governance; creating working groups of senior leaders, managers, and individual contributors focused on improving policies and practices to improve employee development, belonging and hiring; supporting 11 employee resource groups; offering inclusive interview training; and investing in tools that deliver weekly DEI-related learning content to employees. 
Employee Engagement and Retention Employee voice and engagement is a cornerstone to how we create a culture of belonging that allows all of us to do our best work to deliver for our customers every day. This includes administering periodic employee engagement surveys, pulse surveys, feedback sessions, office hours, and 1:1s, and applying our cultural values as a common language for feedback and candidate assessment. Our cultural values are also used to coach and celebrate our teammates, and are a central aspect of our onboarding, performance management, and development processes, and help us to attract, inspire, and retain a diverse, world-class team.
Learning and Development. We encourage our employees to aim high and continuously improve not only on the products and services we tirelessly deliver to our customers, but also invest in themselves. We provide our employees with ongoing professional development, educational resources and leadership opportunities, reimbursements for continued education and conference attendance, access to online educational content, mentorship programs, lunch and learn programming, reimbursed travel to our corridor countries, and customer empathy programs and workshops. 
Benefits and Compensation. We strive to offer market-competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain employees for the long-term. Equity ownership is a key element of our total compensation program, allowing employees to share in our successes and aligning their interests with our long-term goals. We believe that providing employees with equity ownership in our company is fundamental to employee engagement and to our employees feeling valued and recognized for their contributions to our company and our mission. We award promotions and performance equity grants based on an employee’s customer and business impact and their demonstration of our values. To ensure fair and equitable pay, we benchmark our employee compensation with external sources and internally inspect for pay parity twice yearly during performance cycles.

We strive to provide comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the unique needs of our employees, including benefits such as medical, dental, and vision insurance, a health savings account with company contribution, family and medical leave, flexible work schedules, paid holidays and flexible vacation, as well as mental health services access to coaching and counseling support, and support for infertility. We offer benefits through Maven so all employees on any path to parenthood have 24/7 access to virtual care, ranging from prenatal support and family planning, to delivery, postpartum, and pediatrics that support diverse family structures. Remitly also participates in the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) so our teammates who identify as Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People have access to the care they need. We sponsor a 401(k) plan that includes a matching contribution and offer financial coaching through a third-party provider, and, upon completion of our initial public offering in September 2021, we adopted an employee stock purchase plan to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock with accumulated payroll deductions at a discount.
Employee Wellness. Employee safety and well-being is paramount to us ever more so in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We provide productivity and collaboration tools and resources for employees working remotely, including training and toolkits to help leaders effectively lead and manage remote teams. In addition to expanding our mental health benefits to not only our employees, but also up to 3 dependents in every employee’s household, we also created informal routines that include Wellness Wednesdays and virtual Kitchen Conversations to promote employee connection and wellness through the pandemic. We also provided stipends and a virtual ergonomic assessment program to help employees set up home workspaces. 
COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we announced in March 2020 that most of our employees would have the flexibility to work from home. Since then, some of our employees have returned to working from the office and we expect a portion of employees will continue to work from our offices subject to international and U.S. federal, state and local guidelines. We will also support others working from home on a permanent basis. 
Corporate Philanthropy
When immigrant communities have access to financial tools and resources, they change the future for themselves and their loved ones. They also transform the local economies where they live and work, as well as the countries where they send money. Through Remitly’s charitable giving programs, we plan to invest in and support the organizations and coalitions who are committed to improving economic, financial and social inclusion of immigrants and their families. We have also joined Pledge 1%, a global movement that encourages and empowers companies of all sizes and stages to donate 1% of their staff time, product, profit, and/or equity to social good. Our major corporate philanthropy programs include the following:
Pledge 1%. Our Pledge 1% commitment publicly acknowledges our intent to give back and increase social impact, in order to sustainably fund a portion of our corporate social responsibility goals and further our mission to expand financial inclusion for immigrants. As such, in July 2021, our board of directors approved the reservation of up to 1,819,609 shares of our common stock (which was approximately 1.0% of our fully-diluted capitalization as of June 30, 2021) that we may issue to or for the benefit of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation or a similar charitable organization pursuant to our Pledge 1% commitment in equal installments over ten years. On September 10, 2021, we executed the stock donation agreement, where we committed to issue 181,961 shares as the first installment of our Pledge 1% commitment to Remitly Philanthropy Fund, a donor advised fund that is administered on our behalf by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Inc. On September 28, 2021, the Company donated 181,961 shares of its common stock to Remitly Philanthropy Fund, pursuant to the stock donation agreement. We also have a multifaceted social good program that aligns with our partnership with Pledge 1%. This includes:
Corporate and Employee Giving. In 2021, we funded over $110,000 in financial assistance through our Remitly Scholars Program that helps students at the University of the Philippines pay for school fees, books, food, school supplies and other resources they might need to successfully graduate from college. In addition, in the past year, our employees have collectively donated nearly $125,000 to support immigrant communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic globally and anti-racist movements that have supported Black, Asian and Latino communities in the United States.
Product Deployment. When natural disasters and other crises hit, especially in the global south where many of our customers' families reside, we support our customers who need to send money home quickly by providing fee waivers so more of their remittances can be deployed to address immediate needs. 
Volunteering. In 2021, we focused on virtual volunteering and engagement and delivered several Employee Action Guides that provide resources for employees to volunteer virtually or engage safely in-person. Employees volunteered as mentors and career coaches, offering time and experience to students entering into the technology field. The Action Guides also provide employees with self-paced learning and mental health resources that can be shared with their online and offline networks. 
Civic Engagement. In addition to volunteering, we encourage our employees to use their voice through learning about the civic process, register to vote and learn about how to engage with community leaders to influence change. We hosted workshops to help employees learn about civic engagement and community issues.
