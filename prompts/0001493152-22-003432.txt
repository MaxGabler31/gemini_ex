ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Regulatory Overview - Legal and Operational Risks
 
Kun Peng International Ltd. (“KPIL”) is not a Chinese operating company but rather a Nevada holding company with operations in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) conducted by various subsidiaries and through contractual agreements with a variable interest entity (“VIE”) (King Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd, hereinafter referred to as “King Eagle VIE”), as discussed in greater detail below, which structure involves unique risks to shareholders and investors including but not limited to the following:

● | PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, value added telecommunications and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, certain of our operations and businesses in the PRC are conducted through contractual arrangements with King Eagle VIE which give us effective control over and enable us to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from these business operations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | While we have been advised by our PRC counsel that the ownership structures of our PRC subsidiary and the King Eagle VIE in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect; that the contractual arrangements are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect but have not been tested in court, KPIL faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect the enforceability of the VIE Agreements, King Eagle VIE’s financial performance and the value of a shareholders KPIL’s shares.

● | Although the PRC’s Ministry of Commerce and its National Development and Reform Commission have announced new edicts regarding the use of VIEs for new overseas offerings, they have indicated that such new requirements will not affect the foreign ownership of companies already listed overseas. Nonetheless there can be no assurance that such new rules and regulations will not be applied retroactively which may have a substantial impact on KPIL’s business and consequently on the value of KPIL’s securities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Shareholders do not have a direct equity ownership interest in King Eagle VIE but control and receive the economic benefits of its respective business operations in China through the VIE Agreements. Therefore, should the Chinese government disallow or limit the use of the VIE, it could result in a material change in the value of your share ownership including that your shares could significantly decline in value or become worthless. 
● | Because all of our operations are conducted in the PRC through our wholly owned subsidiaries, the Chinese government may exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of your shares. 
● | Regulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection and more stringent laws and regulations may be introduced in China. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. However, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data and there can be no assurance that in the future our operations may not be subject to these regulations which could have a significant material impact on our financial performance and value of our securities. 
● | KPIL’s PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends is based upon their distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to their respective shareholders only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of each of their registered capitals. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. 
● | To address persistent capital outflows and the RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People’s Bank of China, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiaries’ dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. 
● | In addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced under treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%. However, if the relevant tax authorities determine that our transactions or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5% withholding rate will apply to dividends received by our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiaries. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our PRC subsidiaries.

Corporate History and Structure
 
Kun Peng International Ltd. (formerly known as CX Network Group, Inc.)
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 3, 2010, under the name of “mLight Tech, Inc.” (“MLGT”). On July 11, 2017, MLGT merged with and into CX Network Group, Inc., a company incorporated in Nevada on July 25, 2005, with the Company as the surviving corporation pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated July 3, 2017.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Company’s corporate existence is governed by the laws of the State of Nevada and the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company (the “Domicile Change”), and each outstanding share of MLGT’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share was converted into 0.0667 outstanding share of common stock of CXKJ, par value $0.0001 per share at a one-for-fifteen reverse split ratio (the “Reverse Stock Split”) which resulted in reclassification of capital from par value to capital in excess of par value. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, we had 217,300,000 shares of common stock of MLGT issued and outstanding. Immediately upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, we had 14,486,670 shares of common stock of CXKJ issued and outstanding.

The Company’s common stock, which presently trades on the OTC Pink Market under the trading symbol “CXKJ” will change as a result of the name change. Also, as a result of the name change the Company will obtain a new CUSIP number. We have submitted the requisite documents and other information to the Financial Information Regulatory Association, Inc. (“FINRA”) to process the name change and we will make a subsequent announcement at such time as we are assigned a new trading symbol.
 
On March 20, 2018, KPIL, Chuangxiang Holdings Inc., a company incorporated om February 4. 2016, under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“CX Cayman”), and Continent Investment Management Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Continent”), and Golden Fish Capital Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Golden Fish”, together with “Continent”, the “CX Cayman Stockholders”) entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which KPIL acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of CX Cayman in exchange for 5,350,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of KPIL (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, CX Cayman became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Immediately prior to entering into the Share Exchange Agreement with CX Cayman stockholders of CX Cayman, we were a shell company with no significant asset or operation. As a result of the Share Exchange, we operate through our PRC affiliated entity, namely Chuangxiang Network Technology (Shenzhen) Limited, located in Shenzhen, China. CX Cayman does not have any substantive operations other than holding CX HK, which in return holding CX Network, who controls Shenzhen CX through certain contractual arrangements.

Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, Spin-Off Subsidiary buyers will receive all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Spin-Off Subsidiary at a purchase price of $1 at the closing. As a result, Spin-Off Subsidiary buyers will become the sole equity owner of Spin-Off Subsidiary and the Company will have no further interest in Spin-Off Subsidiary.
 
On May 17, 2021, we entered into the Share Cancellation Agreement with a stockholder, Wenhai Xia, to cancel an aggregate of 15,535,309 shares of the Company’s Common Stock owned by the Stockholder.
 
On May 17, 2021, we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with KP International Holdings and holders of all outstanding capital stock of KP International Holdings, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of KP International Holdings, and in exchange, we issued to five former shareholders of KP International Holdings an aggregate of 34,158,391 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result of the reverse acquisition closed on May 17, 2021, KP International Holdings became our wholly owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of KP International Holdings became the holders of approximately 85% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis. For accounting purpose, the transaction with KP International Holdings was treated as a reserve acquisition, with KP International Holdings as the acquirer and KPIL (formerly CX Network) as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the Reverse Acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of KP International Holdings and its subsidiaries and consolidated entities.

Contractual Arrangements
 
While we do not have any equity interest in our consolidated affiliated entities, we have been and are expected to continue to be dependent on them to operate our business as long as there is limitation or prohibition in the interpretation and application by local governments of regulations concerning foreign investments in companies such as our consolidated affiliated entities.

While we currently do not anticipate any changes to PRC laws in the near future that may impact our ability to carry out our business in China, no assurances can be made in this regard. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Changes in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.” For a detailed description of the risks associated with our corporate structure and the contractual arrangements that support our corporate structure, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Commercial Relationship with VIE(s)”.

Since the global health issue and pandemic, people have increased their health and nutrition consciousness. King Eagle (China) believes preventive care is the most effective investment in health. Based on the statistics performed by Euromonitor, China Health Care Association, Prospective Industry Research Institute, the market size of health care products in China is as follows:
 

In the most recent years, e-commerce has developed rapidly in the PRC and management believes that we are in a new era of e-commerce with additional characteristics of sharing economy, offline support and social interaction evolving. We believe the rise of social e-commerce will positively impact the development of our health care business.
 
To promote the awareness of preventive care to the vast population of the people in the PRC, we intend to serve our customers through our mobile (King Eagle Mall) and physical (Smart Kiosk) platforms.
 King Eagle Mall
 
We developed and launched a mobile social e-commerce platform, King Eagle Mall, which promotes preventive health care products and services as our core business. It adopts the S2B2C business model and integrates many major health care products and services.

12
--


The three cores and six features that we are developing through the King Eagle Mall are:
 
Core 1: Integration of resources in the health care industry
 

Feature 1 | Closed-loop supply chain | Compared with the traditional B2B and B2C marketing models, the mobile application, King Eagle Mall, has a more scientific marketing layout without stocking of inventory and capital investment. All the goods in demand are supported by upstream suppliers. Members can sell goods more flexibly, and the distribution of goods is promoted by the way of direct supply by manufacturers, which meets the needs of customers and promotes the increase in product sales. This complete closed-loop supply chain is more conducive to the rapid development of King Eagle (China) and enhance resource utilization. 
--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature 2 | S2B2C model perfectly provides three-terminal users with the most intuitive service and use value. | S2B2C is an innovative e-commerce model that can drive much greater value innovation than traditional models. This kind of innovation is reflected in S (supplier) and B (platform) working together to provide C (customer) with more thorough services. In other words, S empowers B and supports B to conduct product and service transactions with C, while B and C pass on their needs to S, so that S can better serve B and C, satisfying a wider group and achieving a larger demand channel. 

 
Core 2: Personal health management
 

Feature 3 | Combined with Smart Kiosk to enhance personal care service dimensions | Through our physical platform, Smart Kiosk, we create profiles for each member to record personal health data and rely on big data analysis to prompt all aspects of health-related clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other daily living styles. For example, based on the member’s personal health background and medical history, the kiosk analyzes the health condition of the member and suggests types of health supplements, food, health-related products or health checking tools, etc, that are suitable for the member. 
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature 4 | Connecting to health and wellness experience, improving service height. | Ecological + elderly care + healthy lifestyle experience is an indispensable part of the health industry, and it is also a supply and demand gap that will inevitably appear in industrial development and economic development. For middle and high net worth groups, we provide different types of health and elderly lifestyle experience environments. The Smart Kiosk APP provides full-cycle and full-view high-end services, so that there is a connection between health and living. 

Core 3: Wealth value
 

Feature 5 | Sharing Wealth | Health itself is wealth. King Eagle Mall is not just a comprehensive consumer docking platform, it is also a new channel to provide wealth for upstream supply chain enterprises and terminal members. Through the integrated platform, King Eagle (China) shares healthy lifestyle with its members and meets different health needs of different members. 
--------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature 6 | Quality of Life | To strengthen the concept of healthiness, King Eagle Mall will go deep into every corner of life in the future, providing members with more healthy choices in five aspects: clothing, food, home living, daily necessities, and transportation, and guiding our members to lead a healthier and quality life. 

 
The products focus on health-related products and services. King Eagle Mall is designed to enable health-related products to be sold by us and by third parties. King Eagle Mall’s products are divided into two sectors: self-operated products and strictly selected products which promote preventive health care.

Smart Kiosk
 
We introduced “Smart Kiosk” with the support from the previous stakeholder of King Eagle (China), Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd (“Guoxin Ruilian”), wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Group Corporation Ltd and a related party of Guoxin Zhengye. The construction of Smart kiosk was initiated and administered by Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd. After the completion of the construction of Smart Kiosk, Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd assigned its wholly owned subsidiary, Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd to cooperate with King Eagle VIE in development of Smart Kiosk. The Smart Kiosk is a physical platform which focuses on developing “small shop economy”. It is integrated with the King Eagle Mall which creates a “social, health and physical store” to provide people with a more professional and comprehensive preventive health care products and services. Smart Kiosk is a principal component of our business.
 
The smart service kiosk functions as a physical customer service center and community marketing for attracting customers, providing customer services, promoting our 500+ preventive health care and health related household products and introducing concepts of maintaining a healthy life. 5G internet connection is also available for our customers to connect to our online application, King Eagle Mall, so that our customers can access to King Eagle Mall and place orders of our products. Our plans to establish Smart Kiosks in the City of Zhengzhou, in Henan Province, and in the City of Wuhan, in Hubei Province as well as our intention in the future, to deploy Smart Kiosks in 20 provinces across the PRC have been indefinitely delayed due to COVID-19.
 
On March 31, 2021, King Eagle VIE entered into an agreement with Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd., and was granted the right to operate 50 Smart Kiosks for five years starting in April 2021. King Eagle VIE is also entitled to the profit sharing from the operation of the Smart Kiosks. The operation of the Smart Kiosks can be administered in one of the three models:
 

● | Operation by King Eagle VIE: The operation of Smart Kiosk is solely administered by King Eagle VIE. Advertising, product promotion, human resources, product display and sales strategies are planned, established, and operated by King Eagle VIE. Profit sharing from the operation of Smart Kiosk is allocated between King Eagle VIE and the party who purchases the right-of-use of Smart Kiosks based on the mutually agreed terms. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cooperative operation of health care and health related product suppliers: King Eagle VIE granted the right of use of Smart Kiosks to its product suppliers who sell their health care and health related household products on King Eagle Mall. The profit sharing is allocated between King Eagle VIE and those product suppliers based on the mutually agreed terms. 
● | Franchise operation: Members of King Eagle Mall are granted the right-of-use of Smart Kiosks to run the business with the training, advertising, sales, and marketing strategies provided by King Eagle VIE. Profit sharing is allocated between King Eagle VIE and the members based on the mutually agreed terms.

COVID-19
 
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic as well as the newer Omicron variant has had and will continue to spread nearly all areas around the world. The spread of coronavirus impacted the operation of business and caused delays in the development or construction of business properties due to shut down in the affected areas. Since the shutdown of several areas in the PRC, the approval process of our applications for the construction permits of smart kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and the construction project of smart kiosks was also postponed. We continue to focus our business through our online platform, King Eagle Mall, to mitigate the adverse impacts by COVID-19 and follow up closely with the local governmental agencies for the application for the construction permits of smart kiosks. Although we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the severity of global situation of COVID-19 and we may take actions as may be required by local government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, partners and community.
 
Strategic Relationships to Provide Comprehensive Health Services
 
Preventive health care focuses upon the relationship between genetics, environment, physiology, psychology, and lifestyle, to assist in addressing health and disease. Physical examinations assist in providing personalized solutions to eliminate the cause of the disease and treat and regulate functional changes, so to help patients overcome disease and lead healthier lives.
 
Although King Eagle (China) terminated its Cooperation Agreement with Peking Union Lawke Center for Functional Medicine Co., Limited, it continues to explore potential strategic relations with other health service providers in order to offer its members and customers integrated health conditioning, tracking management, high-level, personalized, and convenient health and health care, testing, consulting, and other services, based on user testing data in the King Eagle Mall and integrated with global physician resources,
 
Through strategic relationships, King Eagle (China) intends to create a “social e-commerce + health + physical store” integration platform, using smart kiosks as the carrier to provide people with more professional and comprehensive health services. Functional medicine starts from the relationship between genetics, environment, physiology, psychology, and lifestyle, studying the decline of human function to pathological changes, and finally finding the root cause of the disease. Functional medicine offers comprehensive physical examinations and provides personalized solutions to the members to minimize their health risks and treat and regulate body functions.

Regulations Regarding Foreign Investment
 
The Catalogue of Industries for Encouraged Foreign Investment (2020 Edition) (the “Encouraging Catalogue”) was jointly promulgated by the NDRC and the MOFCOM on 27 December 2020, and it came into effect on 27 January 2021. The Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2020 Edition) (the”2020 Negative List”) was jointly promulgated on 23 June 2020 and took effect on 23 July 2020. The Encouraging Catalogue and the 2020 Negative List categorizes the industries into three categories, including “encouraged”, “restricted” and “prohibited”. All industries that are not listed under one of “encouraged”, “restricted” or “prohibited” categories are deemed to be “permitted”. The Encouraging Catalogue and the 2020 Negative List are subject to review and update by the Chinese government from time to time.
Regulation Regarding Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC
 
Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, issued by SAFE and effective in July 4, 2014, regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing and conduct round trip investment in China.
 
Circular 37 and other SAFE rules require PRC residents, including both legal and natural persons, to register with the local banks before making capital contribution to any company outside of China (an “offshore SPV”) with onshore or offshore assets and equity interests legally owned by PRC residents. In addition, any PRC individual resident who is the stockholder of an offshore SPV is required to update its registration with the local banks with respect to that offshore SPV in connection with change of basic information of the offshore SPV such as its company name, business term, the shareholding by individual PRC resident, merger, division and with respect to the individual PRC resident in case of any increase or decrease of capital in the offshore SPV, transfer of shares or swap of shares by the individual PRC resident. Failure to comply with the required SAFE registration and updating requirements described above may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV, including increasing the registered capital of payment of dividends and other distributions to, and receiving capital injections from the offshore SPV. Failure to comply with Circular 37 may also subject the relevant PRC residents or the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.
 
Regulations Regarding Foreign Exchange
 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and revised in 1997 and 2008 and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is convertible into other currencies without prior approval from SAFE only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest, and dividends and after complying with certain procedural requirements. The conversion of RMB into other currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside PRC for the purpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from SAFE or its local office. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be made in RMB. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local office. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency proceeds into RMB.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142 which regulates the conversion by a foreign-funded enterprise of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011, in order to clarify the application of Circular 142. Under Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 and Circular 45 could result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines as set out in the relevant foreign exchange control regulations. On July 4, 2014, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4, 2014. However, SAFE Circular 36 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from directly or indirectly using the Renminbi converted from their foreign exchange capitals for purposes beyond its business scope. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 came into force and replace both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 36 allows enterprises established within the pilot areas to use their foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment and removes certain other restrictions provided under Circular 142 for these enterprises. Circular 19 will remove those restrictions for all foreign-invested enterprises established in the PRC. However, both Circular 36 and Circular 19 continue to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using the Renminbi fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.

--


On June 9, 2016, SAFE promulgated Circular 16, which provides an integrated standard for converting foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign exchange capital and foreign debts) on a discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. The Circular 16 reiterates the principle that Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi shall not be provided as loans to its non-affiliated entities, except where it is expressly permitted in the business license.
 
Regulations regarding privacy and data protection
 
Regulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. New laws and regulations that govern new areas of data protection or impose more stringent requirements may be introduced in China. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data.
 
The PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to privacy and data security is evolving. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities in April 2020, which became effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period.
 
On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law defines various types of national security, including technology security and information security.
 
On November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) and will accept public comments until December 13, 2021. The draft Regulations on Network Data Security provide that data processors refer to individuals or organizations that autonomously determine the purpose and the manner of processing data. If a data processor that processes personal data of more than one million users intends to list overseas, it shall apply for a cybersecurity review. In addition, data processors that process important data or are listed overseas shall carry out an annual data security assessment on their own or by engaging a data security services institution, and the data security assessment report for the prior year should be submitted to the local cyberspace affairs administration department before January 31 of each year.

We currently have less than one million registered users on our digital and only require and obtain user information after users register with it. Given that we sell and service products through our digital platform, we may constitute a “data processor,” but the number of our online registered users is far less than one million. As a result, even if enacted, we would not be required to apply for a cybersecurity review under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments). Nevertheless, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) are still being formulated and subject to further changes Although we believe we currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments), the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments), or the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, we face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules and we may in the future be required to perform a data security assessment annually either by ourselves or by retaining a third party data security service provider and submitting such data security assessment report to the local agency every year under the draft Regulations on Network Data Security
 
On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals carrying out data activities, prohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority with any data stored in China without approval from competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses.
 
On August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law which took effect on November 1, 2021. In addition to other rules and principles of personal information processing, the Personal Information Protection Law specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information refers to personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific identity, medical and health, financial account, personal whereabouts, and other information of an individual, as well as any personal information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where strict protection measures are taken, may personal information processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the individual’s rights and interests. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the Personal Information Protection Law, we cannot assure you that we will comply with the Personal Information Protection Law in all respects and regulatory authorities may order us to rectify or terminate our current practice of collecting and processing sensitive personal information.
 
Compliance with the PRC Cybersecurity Law, the PRC National Security Law, the Data Security Law, the Cybersecurity Review Measures, the Personal Information Protection Law, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to negative publicity, which could harm our reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock in the future. PRC regulators, including the Department of Public Security, the MIIT, the SAMR and the CAC, have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection, and are enhancing the protection of privacy and data security by rulemaking and enforcement actions at central and local levels. We expect that these areas will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to penalties, including fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the above and other regulatory requirements or privacy protection-related laws, rules and regulations could result in reputational damages or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumers, or others. These proceedings or actions could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our data and other business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.

Taxation
 
PRC Enterprise Income Tax
 
The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules provide that from January 1, 2008, a uniform income tax rate of 25% is applied equally to domestic enterprises as well as foreign investment enterprises.
 
The EIT Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends and other distributions payable by a PRC resident enterprise to investors who are “non-resident enterprises” (that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant dividend or other distribution is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business). However, pursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income effective on December 8, 2006, the withholding tax rate for dividends paid by a PRC resident enterprise is 5% if the Hong Kong enterprise is determined by the competent tax authority in the PRC to have satisfies the relevant conditions and requirements under the applicable laws ; otherwise, the dividend withholding tax rate is 10%. According to the Notice of the PRC State Administration of Taxation on Issues relating to the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009, and effective on the same day, the corporate recipient of dividends distributed by PRC enterprises must satisfy the direct ownership thresholds at all times during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. However, if a company is deemed to be a pass-through entity rather than a qualified owner of benefits, it cannot enjoy the favorable tax treatments provided in the tax arrangement. In addition, if transactions or arrangements are deemed by the relevant tax authorities to be entered into mainly for the purpose of enjoying favorable tax treatments under the tax arrangement, such favorable tax treatments may be subject to adjustment by the relevant tax authorities in the future.
 
Business Tax and Value-added Tax
 
Pursuant to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and effective on January 1, 1994, as amended on November 10, 2008, and effective January 1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services.
 
In March 2016, the Ministry of Finance and SAT jointly issued the Pilot Program of Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax (“VAT”) in an All-round Manner, or Circular 36, effective from May 2016, according to which PRC tax authorities have started imposing VAT on revenues from various service sectors, including real estate, construction, financial services and insurance, as well as other lifestyle service sectors, replacing the business tax replacing the business tax that co-existed with VAT for over 20 years. According to Provisional Regulations on VAT of the PRC and its detailed rules for the Implementation, organizations and individuals engaging in the sale of goods or processing, repair and assembly services, the sale of services, intangible assets, immovables, and importation of goods in the PRC shall be taxpayers of VAT and shall pay VAT pursuant to these regulations.
 
Business License
 
Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work. Other than regular business licenses that we have already obtained, there is no special license or permit required for us to engage in the current businesses under PRC laws and regulations.
 
Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers the scope of the business in which such company is engaged. Following the Share Exchange, we conduct our business through our control of KP International Holdings. Each of King Eagle (China) and King Eagle VIE holds a business license that covers its present business.

Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a FIE has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
 
After-tax profits/losses with respect to the payment of dividends out of accumulated profits and the annual appropriation of after-tax profits as calculated pursuant to PRC accounting standards and regulations do not result in significant differences as compared to after-tax earnings as presented in our financial statements. However, there are certain differences between PRC accounting standards and regulations and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, arising from different treatment of items such as amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration rising from business combinations.
 
In addition, under the EIT Law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, which became effective on December 8, 2006, and the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which became effective on April 1, 2018, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%, or at a rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiary is considered a “beneficial owner” that is generally engaged in substantial business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion.

Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection
 
On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which became effective as of January 1, 2008, and amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.
 
Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation.
 
On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
 
Our standard employment contract complies with the requirements of the Employment Contract Law and its implementing regulations. We have entered into written employment contracts with all of our employees.
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
 
In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law and Administration Measures on Housing Fund, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds.
