Overview
 
Leader Hill Corporation is headquartered in Shenzhen, China and primarily operates in the industry of business consulting. At present, the only service that has been provided by the Company thus far, has been the research and creation of a ‘feasibility report’. All other additional services are prospective, and have not, as of this point in time, been performed for any clients yet. We believe that we have the capacity to offer any of the below services immediately upon securing an agreement with a client. We assist, and plan to continue to assist, start-up to mid-size companies in the East Asia region, with a focus on mainland China and Hong Kong. Our core services are divided into four categories: company formation, corporate secretarial and administration, accounting and bookkeeping, and general business consulting services.
Company Formation
 
Leader Hill Corporation plans to assist clients with company incorporation and domestication services globally through the expertise of our current management. The Company plans to assist clients with identifying the optimum corporate jurisdiction, in the Company’s opinion, for the client’s incorporation by identifying what, per the Company’s belief, is the optimum corporate structure to legally protect their assets and gain access to worldwide markets, while also legally minimizing local and international taxation. The process of incorporating a company on behalf of a client depends on the jurisdiction in which the company intends to operate in as well as a variety of other factors. Leader Hill’s team plans to discuss, with each client the tax and legal implications per select jurisdictions along with the process involved in incorporating their company. Leader Hill will spend time to ensure client’s onshore or offshore structure provides the following benefits:

a. | Company incorporation in a politically stable jurisdiction; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | Minimization of international tax liabilities; 
c. | Minimal statutory filling obligations; 
d. | Registration of a company offshore offers unrestricted flow of capital and transfer of assets globally; 
e. | Limited liability for company directors; 
f. | A corporate bank account with an international retail or private bank; 
g. | Low share capital requirement; 
h. | Company formation in jurisdiction with professional reputation such as Singapore and Hong Kong (since they are not considered tax havens); 
i. | To hold directors/shareholders meetings anywhere in the world; 
j. | Efficient requirements for audit and maintaining accounting records.

Corporate Secretarial Services
 
We plan to provide corporate secretarial services to our new and existing clients. Clients may need to appoint a Company Secretary to maintain organization and ensure that the Company is following appropriate procedures. We plan to offer assistance with general corporate filings, managing corporate changes, and retrieval of any official corporate documents.
 Our secretarial services may include, but are not strictly limited to:

We plan to utilize single-entry and double-entry bookkeeping (two common bookkeeping methods) and will ask each client for their preference in regards to which method they prefer. We will make sure that all business and financial transactions are recorded in the correct book, from journal entries, general ledger up to the trial balance stage. From these, we will then prepare a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, changes in equity and other miscellaneous figures based on the specifications provided by each client. We will also provide monthly or quarterly financial reports to make sure our clients understand the financial status of their business. Leader Hill Capital plans to provide the following services:

General Business Consulting
 
We also intend to provide general business consulting services. These services include, but are not limited to, assistance with the preparation of written business plans and advisory services relating to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of future clients. We will also assist with the creation of personalized strategies for business development, and we will also provide due diligence with strategic and operational analysis to help our clients make a more informed business decision. Alongside the M&A process, we will assist our clients with developing financial models, overseeing the valuation process and will ensure that the financials of the potential acquisition target are prepared to be audited.
 
Our current revenues generated thus far have solely been attributed to a feasibility report we have provided to a client. The feasibility reports we offer are an opinionated report whereas we discuss the particulars of a client’s company as well as their goals. We then provide an analysis, based upon our own research, as to the industry in which the client operates, an operational model that can help the client company achieve its goals, assist with the valuation of the entity, and provide analysis of prevailing market trends that are pertinent to the client company’s operations, amongst other criteria that can vary on a case by case basis. Our feasibility report can assist a client with multileveled strategies to progress their business(es), which may also include general information about the process of going public. We base our opinions off of industry research and factual sources, although we stipulate that all of our clients should supplement our report with their own research and analysis.
 
Need for Our Services
 
Leader Hill provides corporate support services, on a cost-effective, outsource basis, to start-up companies in the East Asia region, with a focus on mainland China and Hong Kong. We will help our clients remain competitive in their industries and ease their corporate burdens through our multi-faceted business consulting services. We anticipate a growing need of our business in East Asia because of the cost-effectiveness of our services. In today’s complex corporate landscape there is an increasing need for enterprises, in all industries, to maximize their performance and profitability through means that are as cost effective as possible. We believe that our sole officer and director’s business experience and our competitive fees will provide us with a competitive advantage.
Marketing Plan
 
We expect to increase our marketing efforts through our President’s personal networks and industry association channels which have not, at this point in time, been fully identified. Additionally, we intend to bolster our professional reputation and image by showcasing our knowledge and industry expertise via marketing campaigns through various forms of media. We have undefined plans to initially market our services through webinars, the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information offerings. Furthermore, we plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. A targeted campaign is intended to be made to focus on start-ups and small to mid-size businesses in various industries.

Competition
 
The business consulting industry is very competitive and fragmented in the market niche in which our Company operates. There are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market. A significant number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we possess. Additionally, we face substantial competition for potential clients and for technical and professional personnel from providers of similar specialties, which range from giant national companies headquartered on Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China to affiliates of some of the largest accounting firms, business consulting firms in East Asia.
 
We believe that existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive pricing and performance characteristics. In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to meet competition or maintain prices, which would likely sacrifice market share. Sales and overall profitability could be reduced in either case.
 
Future Plans
 
Our future plans include expanding the appeal of our services to the East Asia market, although we do not have any distinct timeline in which we will begin conducting these plans save for the fact that we plan to hire more employees to support our operations. To achieve this we will continue to progress our marketing campaign through social media and we plan to hire new employees to support increased online interaction with potential customers. We also plan to advertise online through advertisements that a user may be able to click on to learn more about us and/or our products. We believe we will need to hire an additional 4-5 employees to implement the aforementioned plan to increase our marketing presence. In the future we will continuously evaluate the possibility of expanding our service offerings to meet the needs of potential new clients and offer an expanded range of services to any potential clients we may consummate agreements with in the future.
 
For the remainder of the fiscal year the Company has plans to promote its services through existing contacts and via in person conferences where the Company may be able to interact with and meet with potential new clients. The Company is actively, and for the remainder of the fiscal year, will be researching upcoming business conferences that it may be able to attend to promote its services.
 
In addition to the above the Company is also actively, and will continue the rest of the year, to focus on the creation of a Company website to detail the services the Company offers. The Company believes this will increase exposure to potential new clients. Currently, the website is in development, and may undergo further changes, but can be found at the web address: www.leaderhill.com.
 
Employees
 
As of November 30, 2018, we have one employee, our President, Seah Chia Yee. Currently, Mr. Seah has the flexibility to work on our business up to 30 hours per week, but is prepared to devote more time if necessary. The Company intends to employ 10 employees by the end of 2018, with 3 employees designated to management and administration, 1 employee to marketing, and 6 professionals to providing corporate consulting and support services. It is the intention of the Company to focus on hiring employees who hold relevant professional degrees and above average Mandarin proficiency.
