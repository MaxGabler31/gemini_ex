Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage, cancer-selective gene therapy company focused on developing first-in-class, broadly-applicable product candidates designed to activate a patient’s immune system against their own cancer from within. Our cancer-selective gene therapy platform is built on retroviral replicating vectors, or RRVs, which are designed to selectively deliver therapeutic genes into the DNA of cancer cells. Our gene therapy approach is designed to fight cancer through immunotherapeutic mechanisms of action without the autoimmune toxicities commonly experienced with other immunotherapies. Our founding vision is “No One Should Die Of Cancer” because we believe the immune system can be safely activated to fight the patient’s cancer.
 We are developing our lead product candidate, Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) & Toca FC (flucytosine), initially for the treatment of recurrent high grade glioma, or HGG, a brain cancer with limited treatment options, low survival rates and, therefore, a significant unmet medical need. We are conducting a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with recurrent HGG, which is designed to serve as a registrational trial. In February 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with recurrent HGG and in June 2017 the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted Toca 511 Priority Medicines, or PRIME, Designation for the treatment of patients with glioma. Breakthrough Therapy Designation indicates that preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapy. PRIME Designation indicates that there is a potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. We also have Fast Track Designation (which may lead to expedited regulatory review of new products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need) from the FDA for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of recurrent HGG and Orphan-Drug Designation (a designation for a product that treats a rare disease or condition and which, if the product receives the first FDA approval for that disease or condition, may result in a period of regulatory exclusivity, subject to some exceptions) for the treatment of HGG.  The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA has designated both flucytosine and vocimagene amiretrorepvec as orphan medicinal products indicated for the treatment of glioma. The EMA provides several benefits to drug developers for developing drugs for orphan diseases.
 We have conducted three ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trials involving 127 recurrent HGG patients. In these trials, we investigated three modes of Toca 511 delivery: injection into the cavity wall after surgical resection of the recurred tumor (n=56), direct intratumoral injection without resection (n=54), and intravenous administration followed, approximately one to two weeks later, by resection with further local vector delivery at the time of resection (n=17). Administration of Toca 511 was followed with cycles of Toca FC. In these trials, we observed potential benefits, including durable objective responses, extended overall survival compared to historical controls and a favorable safety profile. We did not reach a dose-limiting toxicity in any of these trials. Based on these Phase 1 clinical trial results, we are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial which is designed to serve as a potential registrational trial in patients with first or second recurrent HGG undergoing resection.
 As of the data cutoff of August 2017, of the 56 patients enrolled in the ascending-dose resection injection Phase 1 trial, 53 were efficacy evaluable and of those, six patients had a complete response and remain in response. Five of these patients with a complete response were within a subset of 23 patients that mirrors the entry criteria, clinical setting and dosing for patients in our Phase 3 clinical trial. Responses were assessed by independent radiology review of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, brain scans. Median duration of response had not been reached after a median follow-up of 35.1 months (range: 9.2 to 44.9 months) which compares favorably to a range of durable responses of 2.79 to 9.62 months in a clinical trial of a drug used as standard of care for recurrent HGG. An association between durable response and overall survival is suggested as all responders remain alive following study entry (range: 21.4 to 52.2 months). As of the data cutoff of August 2017, the subset of 23 patients in our Phase 1 resection injection trial that mirrors the Toca 5 Phase 3 patient population (similar entry criteria, clinical setting and dosing) had a median survival of 14.4 months, with an approximately six-month improvement in median overall survival relative to results from clinical trials of drugs used as standard of care for recurrent HGG. In addition:
  
• | Five of 23 patients had a durable complete response, bringing the durable response rate (objective responses lasting at least 24 weeks) to 21.7%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Median duration of response had not been reached after a median follow up of 35.7 months (range: 14.1 to 44.9 months).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable disease (lasting at least eight weeks) was observed in five additional patients, bringing the clinical benefit rate to 43.5% (10/23 patients).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Landmark overall survival, or OS, rates at two and three years (OS24, OS36) was 34.8% and 26.1%, respectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Increases in immunologic activity were observed with Toca 511 & Toca FC treatment, including elevations of replicating CD4 (often referred to as “helper” T cells) and CD8 (often referred to as “killer” T cells) T cells in the blood, for patients in some cohorts in the resection injection Phase 1 trial.

Based on preclinical data, we believe Toca 511 & Toca FC may have therapeutic benefit in multiple other solid tumor cancers, and we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial in July 2016 of intravenous treatment of metastatic cancers that include colorectal, pancreatic, breast, lung and melanoma cancers, all of which can spread to the brain and other organs. In the Phase 1b trial, Toca 511 will be administered by intravenous injection followed by (1) intratumoral injection following biopsy or (2) injection into the resection cavity wall following planned resection in the case of recurrent HGG or brain metastases. In our completed intravenous clinical trial of Toca 511 for the treatment of recurrent HGG, Toca 511 crossed the blood brain barrier and was detected in brain tumors. In our metastatic cancer trial we plan to evaluate safety, presence of Toca 511 genes in tumors, immunologic activity in the blood and tumor such as changes in CD4 and CD8 T cells and clinical activity such as objective tumor response and clinical benefit. We also plan, in this clinical trial, to evaluate Toca 511 & Toca FC in combination with one or more checkpoint inhibitors.
 Based on our findings in preclinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe Toca 511 & Toca FC is a promising candidate for use in newly diagnosed HGG patients in combination with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, we plan to advance clinical development to evaluate safety and efficacy in this setting with Toca 511 & Toca FC being delivered in conjunction with surgery, radiation and temozolomide.
 Our RRV platform is versatile and we believe it has the potential to deliver a wide variety of genes selectively to cancer cells. Our first RRV-based immunotherapy product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, is designed to replicate without cell lysis then directly kill tumor and immune suppressive myeloid cells activating the immune system against cancer through a combination of mechanisms. In addition, we are developing other RRVs to selectively deliver genes to cancer cells against validated immunotherapy targets, such as the checkpoint protein PD-L1. We generated preclinical data supporting the potential anti-cancer benefits of an RRV delivering a gene against PD-L1. In 2018, we plan to conduct IND-enabling studies of our anti-PD-L1 RRV product candidate.
 Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the United States and accounts for nearly one in four deaths. Early cancer treatments relied on relatively non-specific and highly toxic small molecule chemotherapies. Over the last 20 years, a new paradigm of cancer research and treatment has emerged that is focused on more targeted therapies. Most recently this has included the emergence of immunotherapies that can stimulate a patient’s immune system to slow the growth and the spread of, and ideally, eliminate, cancer cells. These therapies have shown the potential to provide dramatic efficacy and to extend survival for cancer patients even in cases in which conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have already been used. In 2013, Science magazine named cancer immunotherapy as the biggest breakthrough of the year. With this breakthrough, global pharmaceutical companies as well as a large number of emerging companies are researching and developing new cancer immunotherapy treatments.
 Despite these advancements, many current immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and T cell receptor, or TCR, T cells, are limited by their autoimmune and other side effects. Combination treatments are common in cancer, but combinations of immune mediated treatments with systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy may be challenging as chemotherapy is often damaging to the immune system. Thus, immunotherapies effective enough to be able to displace systemic chemotherapy are needed. The utility of oncolytic viruses alone as immunotherapy has been challenged by lack of specificity to tumor cells, injury to healthy tissues, lack of targeting to specific brakes on the immune system, and short-term effect due to effective clearance of the virus. Consequently, there remains a significant need for immunotherapies that are effective as well as safe and tolerable.
 In contrast to current immunotherapies, we believe our RRV platform and lead product candidate have the potential to selectively infect cancer cells to stimulate robust and durable anti-cancer immune responses with minimal toxicity. Our RRVs are designed to selectively integrate into the DNA of cancer cells which then serve as factories to produce more of these RRVs by budding. The progeny RRV infect neighboring cancer cells, providing long-term presence of the therapeutic gene or genes. Our novel therapies are designed to break immune tolerance selectively in the tumor microenvironment.
 Toca 511 & Toca FC is designed to break immune tolerance through a combination of mechanisms triggered by the conversion of Toca FC into high levels of 5-FU (5-fluorouracil), an anti-cancer agent, by the therapeutic gene delivered by Toca 511 into the cancer cell. Toca 511 & Toca FC treatment is designed for cycles of sustained production of high levels of 5-FU directly in tumors, which we believe is important for robust and durable anti-cancer immune activation. Cancer cell death releases damage-associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, and tumor-associated antigens, resulting in antigen presentation and activation of T cells. 5-FU is known to kill cancer cells and immune cells when used systemically. When 5-FU is present locally, it kills immune-suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor micro-environment while leaving systemic immune activity clinically intact. The local immune-suppressive myeloid cells include myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, as well as tumor associated macrophages, or TAMs, which are white blood cells recruited and retained by the tumor that contribute to the suppression of normal immune activity against cancer cells. TAMs and MDSCs suppress the number and activity of CD4 and CD8 T cells and work with the lymphocyte-derived suppressor T cells called regulatory T cells, or Tregs. MDSC and TAM destruction by 5-FU is designed to contribute to immune activation against the tumor-associated antigens. We believe the persistence of the therapeutic gene in the cancer cells has allowed for multiple cycles of Toca FC treatment in our trials, which may result in additional killing of cancer cells and immunosuppressive myeloid cells, leading to enhancement of the strength and durability of the immune response with each successive cycle of Toca FC treatment. Also, in a trial with multiple Toca 511 intravenous infusions followed by resection, we observed increased Toca 511 in the tumor compared to single day infusion.

We have retained worldwide rights to the development and commercialization of therapeutic product candidates derived from our RRV platform in all indications. We have licensed rights to, and collaborate with, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., or Siemens, to develop diagnostics related to the clinical development and future commercialization of Toca 511 & Toca FC. We have intellectual property protection in major markets worldwide, including 76 issued and granted patents and 72 patent applications (foreign and domestic) on our technology platform and novel product candidates, which we believe will maintain coverage from issued patents until approximately 2030. Since inception in 2007, we have funded our operations primarily through the sales of our equity securities from which we received $230.2 million in net proceeds. 
 Our Proprietary Technology Platform: Harnessing Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Together to Fight Cancer
 Cancer immunotherapy, also termed immuno-oncology, has recently emerged as an exciting field of cancer therapy with the approval of drugs that aim to enhance anti-cancer immune responses by, for example, overcoming the suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed to evade the immune system. Despite recent advances, current cancer immunotherapies have limitations. They often lead to unwanted and unanticipated autoimmune toxicities. Also, treatment effectiveness may be limited by previous or co-treatment with systemic cytotoxic chemotherapies, which damage the immune system. In addition, knocking out a particular brake on the immune system may not be relevant to a particular clinical setting or the tumor may simply not be immunogenic enough to become a target for immune clearance.
Early promising cancer gene therapies designed to provoke antitumor immune responses predominantly focused on enhancing the activation of the immune system by delivering genes for cytokines. Most of the first generation non-replicating cancer gene therapy viral vectors, however, were limited in their ability to enter and persist in a sufficient number of cancer cells to generate robust and durable anti-cancer immune responses consistently. Second generation cancer gene therapy vectors are replicating and, in the case of immunotherapies, have primarily consisted of oncolytic viruses, which lyse infected cells and activate the immune system against the virus, leading to its rapid clearance.
 We believe our investigational gene therapy platform and therapeutic genes represent innovative and differentiated approaches in cancer-selective immunotherapy which have the potential to drive a safe, powerful and durable immune response against cancer, without triggering autoimmunity. We chose to utilize RRVs as the basis of our gene therapy platform for cancer-selective immunotherapy because they exhibit several characteristics that we believe allow us to optimize the safety, delivery and persistence of our therapeutic genes in cancer cells. These characteristics include that they:
  
• | replicate readily and persist in the immune-defective environment of cancer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are controlled in healthy tissue by normal immune mechanisms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | only infect dividing cells such as cancer cells;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | bud from, rather than lyse, infected cancer cells, reducing anti-RRV immune activation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | infect most cancer types; and
--+------------------------------


• | can cross the blood tumor barrier.
--+-----------------------------------

 Our lead product candidate is a cancer-selective immunotherapy comprised of an investigational biologic, Toca 511, and an investigational small molecule, Toca FC, that are designed to be used together. Toca 511 is an injectable RRV that encodes a prodrug activator enzyme, cytosine deaminase, or CD. Its selective delivery to cancer cells means that the infected cancer cells selectively carry the CD gene and produce CD. Toca FC is an investigational orally administered prodrug, 5-FC, that is inactive as an anti-cancer drug. We believe Toca 511 & Toca FC is a promising choice for the following reasons:
  
• | CD is able to convert the anti-fungal drug, 5-FC, into the broadly applicable anti-cancer drug, 5-FU, in the cancer microenvironment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CD provides additional anti-cancer selectivity, as humans do not have this gene;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the short half-life of 5-FU limits its direct killing to the localized area of the tumor micro-environment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | local 5-FU has powerful effects on increasing survival in immune competent animals after only a few cycles of 5-FC; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MDSCs and TAMs are very sensitive to 5-FU-mediated killing, which may reduce immune tolerance to the cancer.

Our Pipeline
 
Our Strategy
 Our focus is to develop and commercialize first-in-class cancer-selective immunotherapies using our proprietary gene therapy platform. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Advancing Toca 511 & Toca FC rapidly through clinical development and regulatory approval in recurrent HGG. We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with recurrent HGG. If we achieve our primary endpoint, overall survival, and/or secondary endpoints, such as durable response rate, we plan to discuss submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, based on this data with the FDA. We believe such data could serve as the basis for regulatory approval. In February 2017, the FDA granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with recurrent HGG and in June 2017 the EMA granted Toca 511 PRIME Designation for the treatment of patients with glioma. In October 2017, following discussions with the FDA, we redesigned our Phase 2/3 clinical trial to be a single Phase 3 clinical trial, thereby including the 187 patients that were previously enrolled in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial in the total of 380 patients expected to enroll in the redesigned trial. The primary endpoint of the redesigned trial is OS. The primary endpoint assumes a median OS of 9.8 months for the control arm versus 14.3 months for the Toca 511 & Toca FC arm. A total of 257 events will provide the redesigned trial with 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.685. The redesigned trial includes planned interim analyses at 50% and 75% of events, estimated to occur in the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019, respectively. As a result of this transition to a seamless Phase 3 clinical trial design, a previously planned data analysis of the Phase 2 portion of the original Phase 2/3 trial will no longer occur. We also have completed three ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trials in recurrent HGG with varying modes of delivery of the Toca 511 vector and a Phase 1b clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic colorectal, pancreatic, breast, lung and melanoma cancers. In addition, based on our findings in preclinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe Toca 511 & Toca FC is a promising candidate for use in newly diagnosed HGG patients in combination with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, we plan to advance clinical development in the first half of 2018 to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in this setting. We are also developing other RRVs to selectively deliver genes to cancer cells against validated immunotherapy targets, such as the checkpoint protein PD-L1.

• | Expanding the therapeutic use of Toca 511 & Toca FC into newly diagnosed HGG and other solid cancer indications. In July 2016, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial in metastatic cancers including colorectal, pancreatic, breast, lung and melanoma. In 2018, we plan to advance our clinical development plan evaluating Toca 511 & Toca FC in newly diagnosed HGG patients. We believe Toca 511 & Toca FC has potential broad applicability in the treatment of solid cancers and, because of its safety and efficacy profile in clinical trials to date, it could serve as the foundational therapy in a variety of combination treatments, if successfully developed and approved. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercializing Toca 511 & Toca FC in key markets. If approved, we plan to build the capabilities to commercialize Toca 511 & Toca FC through medical science liaisons and a specialty sales force in key markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing strategic partnerships to expand the commercial opportunity for, and accelerate the development of, our product candidates. We may choose to selectively partner our lead product candidate or our future product candidates in territories or therapeutic areas where a partner could bring additional resources and expertise; however, we plan to retain development and commercialization rights in key markets to maximize strategic flexibility. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging our RRV platform and core competencies to continue discovering and developing a broad pipeline of novel cancer-selective immunotherapies. We believe there is a significant opportunity to develop additional

immunotherapy product candidates utilizing our RRV platform. Our scientists have broad expertise in the field of gene therapy, especially cancer-selective gene therapy and immunotherapy. We intend to leverage our platform and expertise to discover and develop a broad pipeline of cancer-selective immunotherapies to help patients fight their cancers without the severe side effect profile typical of cancer treatments.

 Immunotherapy and the Emergence of Cancer-Selective Immunotherapy
 Background on Cancer and Immunotherapy
 Cancer results from damage to the genes of the cell, sometimes exacerbated by underlying genetic defects such as those in oncogene regulation, DNA repair and immune competence. When cancerous cells acquire novel proteins, called tumor-associated antigens, the immune system is believed to act as a surveillance system that can seek and destroy these mutated cells. However, over time, the cancer cell mutation process results in the activation of certain genes and/or the inactivation of others, leading to the ability of the cancer cells to hide from the immune system and grow, eventually becoming malignant and having the ability to invade and destroy healthy tissue. The process of cancer becoming able to hide from the immune system is referred to as developing immune tolerance to the cancer antigens.
 To achieve immune tolerance, cancer tissue modifies the immune system by dampening or inactivating key immune mechanisms to thereby allow the cancer to hide from or diminish the immune system. An important example of the mechanism of local immune suppression is the attraction, retention and expansion of immune-suppressive myeloid cells such as MDSCs and TAMs, which are suppressors of immune cell killing of cancer cells both directly and through their support of Tregs. Also, in HGG and other tumors, the cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells often deploy proteins on their cell surface such as PD-L1 to activate the programmed death-1, or PD-1, proteins on the surface of lymphocytes creating a brake on the immune system. The tumor can also produce increased amounts of IDO-1 proteins, which both metabolize and drastically reduce tryptophan, an amino acid important in immune activation, and produce catabolites that are immune-suppressive. The cancer cells may also release cytokines such as TGF-beta which lead to local immune suppression.
 In order for a patient to conquer his or her cancer, the patient typically needs treatment that can overcome most or all of these immune tolerance mechanisms. Once tolerance is broken and the patient’s immune system can attack and destroy the cancer, it precipitates a prolonged process of immune activation and the development of a robust and durable immune response.
 Immunotherapy is an emerging field of cancer treatment that aims to activate the immune system, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells and their resulting tumors have developed. Approaches in immunotherapy generally have one of two desired effects on the immune system: “putting the foot on the gas,” which stimulates the immune system by therapies including vaccine-, cytokine-, antibody-, cellular- and adjuvant-based approaches; and “removing the brakes,” which removes the inhibition of the immune system, and currently mainly consists of monoclonal antibodies targeted against ligands and receptors that tumor cells use to suppress the immune system, such as PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4. To date, these approaches have been demonstrated to activate the immune system to varying degrees, leading to anti-cancer benefits, but have often caused moderate to severe autoimmunity against healthy tissue, in many cases leading to discontinuation of treatment, persistent toxicity or even death.
 Our Approach to Immunotherapy
 Due to the novel mechanisms of action and favorable safety profile in clinical studies to date, we believe our RRVs represent an important advancement in the field of immunotherapy. Our approach is designed to enhance immune responses against cancer cells and, in the case of our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, reduce immune-suppressive myeloid cell inhibition of the immune system. Also, we believe our RRV platform has the potential to be safely combined with conventional therapies and complement emerging checkpoint inhibitors and other approaches to cancer immunotherapy.
Our RRV Platform
 We have developed a first-in-class gene therapy platform, based on a genus of retroviruses called gamma retroviruses, designed to selectively deliver therapeutic genes to cancer cells. Native gamma-retroviruses, which were originally isolated from cancer cells, possess three useful properties as a gene therapy vector for human cancers: they have been demonstrated to be reasonably benign in primates; they only infect dividing cells and selectively infect cancer cells in vivo; and they have a small, simple genome structure that allows straightforward vector construction.
 Our RRVs are not known human pathogens as they only exhibit minimal virulence gene activity. Virulence genes ordinarily result in widespread infection of healthy cells. Gamma retroviruses have evolved in a way that makes infection, replication and spread in immune deficient cancer cells more permissive than infection of healthy cells and tissues. Specifically, RRVs and their progeny do not directly kill the cells they infect during spread. Instead they bud from infected cells, which is less likely to stimulate an immune 
 6

response to the virus. In contrast, oncolytic viral infection and cell lysis typically cause marked inflammation, leading to rapid viral clearance.
 Although RRVs can spread in tumors, they usually cannot replicate and spread in healthy tissues in the body due to antiviral immune system activity. In healthy cells, gamma retroviruses are typically controlled by powerful cellular resistance factors whose production can be driven by Type 1 interferons, a subgroup of interferon proteins that help regulate the activity of the immune system to kill cancer cells and virally-infected cells. In contrast, cancer cells usually have defective Type 1 interferon signaling pathways, possibly from selective pressure from Type 1 interferons in the cancer microenvironment, potentially leading to lower levels of antiretroviral resistance factors. Our RRVs predominantly rely on immune deficiencies of cancer cells and tumors, combined with its non-inflammatory nature, to replicate and spread throughout the tumor and we believe have a good balance between attenuation and replication efficiency. In another mechanism of specificity, RRVs do not encode nuclear localization signals which, in certain viruses such as lentiviruses, facilitate virus entry into the nucleus of non-dividing cells to allow productive infection. Without nuclear localization signals, RRVs only enter the nuclei of dividing cells, such as cancer cells, during the time the nuclear membrane opens to create two daughter cells. Hence, RRVs have inherent selectivity to cancer and we have demonstrated this selectivity in vivo as shown below in a glioma growing in a mouse brain.
 Further, in humans, as shown in the images below, in patients with HGG treated with Toca 511 and then Toca FC, in subsequently re-resected tumors, we confirmed the presence of CD protein (stained brown in left image) in tumor cells but not in nearby normal brain cells (stained blue in right image). 
 
Our novel RRV platform is designed to be versatile. In preclinical testing, we have stably delivered several different therapeutic genes, and we can create new vectors using a well-defined process to insert one or more therapeutic genes into our RRVs. We have also engineered RRVs to enhance their suitability for therapeutic purposes. For example, we converted therapeutic genes of viral or fungal origin to use mammalian codons resulting in enhanced genomic stability as the RRV replicates and increased protein production in infected cells. We also modified the native vector by replacing the highly restrictive native envelope gene with a more permissive envelope gene which allows for entry of our RRV into most cancer cells through a widely available phosphate transport channel. 
In addition to developing our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, we are employing strategies to deliver genes which can reduce the production of specific proteins. For example, we built RRVs designed to inhibit the “brakes” on the immune system, from PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, by inhibiting PD-L1 protein function in the cancer cells. Specifically, we have built RRVs with genes for anti-PD-L1 single chain antibodies and are evaluating them in our anti-PD-L1 preclinical program.
 Our safety data with gamma retroviruses, preclinically and in humans, suggest that our RRV technology is worth exploring in combination with many conventional and newly developed cancer treatments. 
 Our Lead Product Candidate: Toca 511 & Toca FC
 Our lead product candidate is a combination of an investigational biologic, Toca 511, and an investigational small molecule drug, Toca FC, designed to be used together. Toca 511 is a proprietary injectable RRV that encodes a prodrug activator enzyme, CD. CD is derived from yeast, and humans do not naturally have this gene. Its selective delivery to cancer cells means that the infected cancer cells selectively carry the CD gene and produce CD protein. Toca FC is an orally administered, proprietary extended-release version of 5-FC, a prodrug that is inactive as an anti-cancer drug. In humans, the orally administered Toca FC is absorbed and carried 
 7

through the bloodstream, crosses the blood brain barrier and diffuses into the cancer cells. In animal models, we have shown that 5-FC is converted into the active anti-cancer drug, 5-FU, at high concentrations in Toca 511-infected cancer cells that are producing CD protein. 5-FU is a well-established anti-cancer agent that interferes with RNA and DNA metabolism and is used in many conventional chemotherapy settings.
 
Toca 511 contains an optimized yeast-derived CD gene downstream of structural RRV genes which code viral proteins (gag, pol, env). Regulatory genes flank the coding genes on either side.
 In addition to the direct killing of Toca 511-infected cancer cells, 5-FU can kill neighboring uninfected cancer cells and immune-suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor. In our preclinical studies, following direct killing of these cells, our therapy activated the immune system against tumors. Toca 511 & Toca FC treatment is designed for cycles of sustained production of high levels of 5-FU directly in tumors, which we believe is important for robust and durable anti-cancer immune activation.
 Toca 511 & Toca FC has a dual mechanism of action. Our treatment regimen is designed to transform tumors into chemotherapy factories of 5-FU, which kills infected cancer cells and neighboring dividing tumor cells, triggering activation of the immune system against tumor-associated antigens with systemic benefits. In humans, Toca 511 is administered by one of several routes and is allowed to selectively spread through the cancer cells for up to two months. After Toca 511 spreads, Toca FC is administered cyclically, for approximately one week of every four to eight weeks. In re-resected tumors from some patients in our trials, we observed CD protein in the tumor (by immunohistochemistry) but not in contiguous normal brain tissue. We also documented Toca 511 RNA and DNA, including the CD gene, selectively in the tumors. The CD protein produced in the tumor is designed to convert the 5-FC into 5-FU and achieve high intratumoral concentrations. As 5-FU is rapidly inactivated after diffusing from the tumor it has a short half- life and therefore low systemic activity and limited side effects.
 Some patients, whose tumors appeared larger during serial MRI brain scans, had resections. In some of these cases, the re-resected tumor had large areas of necrosis, or tumor death, and dense lymphocytic infiltrates in some remaining areas of cancer, under higher magnification. Enlargement of a tumor during an inflammatory response as part of the killing process, is called pseudo-progression.
 Through a combination of mechanisms and multiple cycles of tumor antigen presentation during Toca FC treatment cycles, tolerance to current and evolving cancer tumor-associated antigens is designed to be broken, leading to lymphocyte infiltration, immune activation, gradual killing and gradual shrinkage of the tumor, sometimes completely, over many months or years.
 In summary, the CD gene we are delivering in our lead product candidate is designed to produce a unique protein which, in combination with oral Toca FC, generates high concentrations of an anti-cancer drug selectively in the tumor, leading to killing of cancer and immune suppressor cells and thereby activating the immune system against the cancer cells.
 Clinical Development of Toca 511 & Toca FC
 Toca 511 & Toca FC in Recurrent High Grade Glioma
 Our initial proposed indication, recurrent HGG, also referred to as malignant glioma, is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer and often strikes in the prime of life. The two most common forms of HGG are glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, and anaplastic astrocytoma or AA, which are grade 4 and grade 3 tumors, respectively. The total number of new diagnoses of HGG expected in 2017 is about 180,000 worldwide and about 16,000 in the United States, with new diagnoses of GBM estimated to 
 8

be approximately 12,500 in 2017 in the United States. Recurrent HGG represents a major unmet medical need. HGG recurs in most patients, even after maximal treatment.
 Historical survival data for HGG trials is limited, though there are many published studies for GBM. Patients with newly diagnosed GBM who receive maximal therapy had a median survival of 14.6, 16.1 or 16.8 months according to three Phase 3 clinical trials published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Current standard of care therapy for patients with newly diagnosed GBM includes surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and is similar in all major markets. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States reports the one-, five-, and 10-year survival rates for patients with GBM as 39.7%, 5.5%, and 2.9% from diagnosis respectively, making it one of the most lethal among all cancers.
 Recurrent HGG is typically treated with oral chemotherapy drugs, such as lomustine or temozolomide, bevacizumab, radiation or further surgery with or without carmustine wafer (marketed as Gliadel wafer by Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC). Survival in our initial proposed indication, recurrent HGG, is shorter than newly diagnosed GBM with reported median overall survival approximately half of that in newly diagnosed patients. There are relatively few trials which report on recurrent HGG (inclusive of both grade 4 and 3). One trial published by Brem in The Lancet reported median overall survival of a carmustine wafer cohort to be 7.2 months. Reported median survival for patients in multicenter clinical trials with recurrent GBM ranges from 7.6 months, from a summary analysis of Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by the North American Brain Tumor Consortium, to 8.4 months, based on a weighted-average from recent lomustine trials. Clinical trials evaluating the anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab have shown median overall survival of 8.0 to 10.0 months in what we believe are particularly favorable patient groups because of the number of first recurrent patients and restrictions on tumor size. Neither surgery nor bevacizumab have been found to prolong survival of patients with recurrent GBM. Historically, partial response, or PR, (tumor shrinkage by 50%) rates for chemotherapy for recurrent HGG are low, typically ranging from 0% to 8.9%. Complete responses, or CR, (disappearance of the tumor) to chemotherapy are extremely rare, typically occurring in less than 1% of patients treated. We chose recurrent HGG as our initial proposed indication because of the significant unmet medical need, together with our goal to minimize time to regulatory approval.
 Our ascending Phase 1 clinical trials and ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial are being conducted pursuant to an IND we submitted to the FDA in September 2009. This IND currently covers the indications of recurrent HGG, newly-diagnosed HGG and metastatic solid tumors. In the future, we may also focus on hematological malignancies.
 Ascending Dose Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 We have three ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trials in recurrent HGG with varying modes of delivery of the Toca 511 vector: injection into the cavity wall after surgical resection of the recurred tumor, direct transcranial intratumoral injection without resection, and intravenous administration followed, approximately one to two weeks later, by resection with further local vector delivery at the time of resection. These clinical trials of Toca 511 & Toca FC are in patients whose tumors have recurred following surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We have treated 127 recurrent HGG patients in these clinical trials in which we observed potential benefits, including extended overall survival and a favorable safety profile. The median overall survival of patients in the resection injection study exceeds historical controls across a variety of previously reported clinical trials and shows a trend towards a dose response. Furthermore, an independent radiology review, or IRR, identified tumor shrinkage in some patients, including several complete and partial responses. 
 The primary goal of these three Phase 1 clinical trials was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Toca 511 & Toca FC. Although all trials were designed to identify the highest safe and well-tolerated dose of Toca 511 & Toca FC, called the maximum tolerated dose, criteria for dose-limiting toxicities were never reached. The most common adverse events associated with Toca 511 are fatigue, headache, and convulsion. For Toca FC, the most common treatment related adverse events are fatigue, diarrhea and nausea. The majority of toxicities are Grades 1-2. The maximum feasible dose of Toca 511 & Toca FC was determined, allowing us to move forward to our Phase 3 clinical trial. The maximum feasible dose of Toca 511 was chosen to be 4 mL delivered by forty 0.1 mL injections with a blunt tip, narrow bore needle and a side port for infusion, which is the highest practical number of injections which can be administered at the time of resection. The secondary goal of each of these three Phase 1 clinical trials is to evaluate the efficacy of Toca 511 & Toca FC, including tumor response observed by MRI and patient survival. These clinical trials also allow us to evaluate the presence of Toca 511 in tumors and tumor pathology at subsequent resection and to measure CD4 and CD8 T cell levels before and following treatment. In addition, we are conducting a continuation trial to follow long term safety and survival in patients from all three of these clinical trials.
 Resection Injection Trial
 In February 2012, we initiated a Phase 1 multicenter ascending dose clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with recurrent HGG who are suitable for resection. As of the data cutoff of August 2017, of the 56 patients enrolled in the ascending-dose resection injection Phase 1 trial, 53 were efficacy evaluable and of those a subset of 23 patients mirrors the entry criteria, clinical setting and dosing for patients in our Phase 3 clinical trial.

In this trial, following tumor resection, Toca 511 was administered by multiple small injections directly into the mixture of brain and cancer tissue surrounding the resection cavity. These injections target the tumor which has been left behind after surgery since the infiltration of the cancer into functional brain regions precludes complete resection. Pursuant to the protocol, the patient begins a seven- to 14-day course of oral Toca FC five to eight weeks following the administration of Toca 511 and repeats this Toca FC cycle every four to eight weeks thereafter. When the recommended Phase 2 dose was determined, cohorts evaluating lomustine or bevacizumab combined with Toca 511 & Toca FC were enrolled to provide safety data for the use of Toca 511 & Toca FC treatment in combination with standard HGG treatment in patients who appeared to be progressing in the ongoing trials. To date, no safety issues have been observed in these expansion cohorts. This clinical trial has completed enrollment, with 56 patients. There were 53 efficacy evaluable patients who received both Toca 511 and Toca FC. Based upon a data cutoff of September 18, 2015, a manuscript was published in Science Translational Medicine (Cloughesy et al. 2016). 
 Of the 56 patients enrolled, 43 were evaluable for response with both IRR and clinical assessment performed. There were 23 patients of the 56 who would have met the entry criteria for the ongoing Phase 3 study. As shown in the table below, in these 23 patients with HGG first or second recurrence treated in the Higher Dose Cohort (as defined below), when compared with baseline MRIs taken just prior to the start of Toca FC dosing (four to eight weeks after surgery), five CRs were identified by an IRR, providing further support for Toca 511 & Toca FC efficacy. All of these patients were continuing to respond as of their last MRI review as of a data cutoff in August 2017 and only received Toca 511 and Toca FC cancer treatment after resection. The CRs were determined based on the Macdonald criteria, including, for CR, complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable tumor. Total clinical benefit includes CRs, PRs and stable disease, or SD. As shown in the table below, five of six responses occurred in patients treated in the Higher Dose Cohort, suggesting a potential dose-response effect. Specifically, in this Phase 1 dose escalation resection trial, across all cohorts, including combination cohorts, no responses were seen in the lowest three Toca 511 doses (1.4 x 107, 3.8 x 108 and 1.5 x 108 Therapeutic Units, or TU). The next four dose increments, referred to as the Higher Dose Cohort, all had durable (defined as greater than 6 months) objective responses (4.8 x 108 TU with two CRs; 1.2 or 1.5 x 109 TU with three CRs; and 4.8 x 109 TU with one CR). We selected to use the Toca 511 dose of ~1 x 109 TU for the registration-directed Toca 5 clinical trial.

In the table below, clinical data for each of the 23 patients is represented by a blue bar, with the x-axis measuring months of survival. Change in patient tumor status (i.e., PD, SD, PR, or CR) are represented along the bar, with the status at the end representing “best response” during the treatment. The green stars indicate the six patients who remain alive at the latest data cutoff. The responses, which occur approximately six to 19 months after Toca 511 administration, are consistent with immunologic response and all responders who remain alive have received no therapy other than Toca 511 & Toca FC since enrolling in the trial. Median duration of response had not been reached after a median follow up of 35.7 months (range 14.1 to 44.9 months).
 Resection Study: Long-Term Survival in Higher Dose Cohort
 


The median overall survival of patients in this resection injection study (in which an ascending range of doses of Toca 511 were injected into the wall of the resection cavity after resection of the tumor) exceeds historical controls across a variety of previously reported clinical trials. Forty-three patients had a median overall survival of 12.4 months that was approximately five months longer relative to a weighted-average of results from clinical trials of drugs used as standard of care for recurrent HGG, including 7.2 months in the active arm of a randomized surgical recurrent HGG trial for the carmustine wafer. In a subset of 30 patients in our resection injection trial who received higher doses of Toca 511, median overall survival was higher, 14.4 months. Furthermore, in the subset of 23 patients in this trial that mirror the entry criteria, clinical setting and dosing for patients in our Phase 3 clinical trial, median overall survival was 13.2 months, an approximate six-month improvement in median overall survival relative to a weighted average of clinical trials of drugs used as standard of care (lomustine or bevacizumab) for recurrent HGG. Finally, in our patients with recurrent GBM at first or second recurrence in our resection injection trial (27 patients), median overall survival was 13.6 months, comparing favorably to the median survival of 7.1 months in the external control study of recurrent GBM patients treated with lomustine. We saw a plateau of survival in the Higher Dose Cohort, with a 40% survival probability at two years (data cutoff of September 18, 2015). Data from our resection injection study was reported in Science Translational Medicine (Cloughesy et al. 2016).

 Furthermore, an independent radiology review of MRI brain scans from our Phase 1 clinical trials identified tumor shrinkage in some patients, including several CRs. All patients in the resection injection trial with objective responses remain with durable response as of August 2017, for a median of 35.7 months, which represents approximately four times longer duration of response relative to responses from a clinical trial of lomustine which showed an estimated median duration of response of approximately six months (range of response duration was 2.79 to 9.62 months).

 This survival data, evidence of tumor response, as well as a reported safety profile of mild and moderate toxicity, encouraged us to plan our registration-directed Toca 5 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in this same setting, enrolling patients with recurrent HGG who were planning for further resection of their tumor. Also, we chose the resection setting for the Toca 5 clinical trial because we believe that resection of the bulk of the tumor and then injection into the residual tumor left behind in the cavity wall provides a longer opportunity for the treatment to activate the immune system against the growing tumor.
 We also tested for changes in CD4 and CD8 T cells in blood during the study, allowing us to evaluate both the safety and activity of our treatment on the immune system. Average increases of 34.0% in total CD4 (p=0.019) and 12.4% in total CD8 (p=0.277) were observed between the visit prior to Toca FC administration and the end of study, suggesting immune activation after Toca 511 & Toca FC treatment (n=43). The p value is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance. The smaller the p value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p value is less than or equal to 0.05, the outcome is statistically significant. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy generally relies on a p value of less than or equal to 0.05. Supporting data was obtained from a subsequent cohort in this trial, and in this case, there were significant increases in activated CD8+ T cells (p=0.015) within the CD8 population from patients (n=6 patients, 39 samples) showing clinical benefit (SD, CR) between pre- and post-treatment measurements, but not from patients with progressive disease (n=7 patients, 48 samples). A sustained increase in activated CD4+ T cells (p=0.16) was also observed within the CD4 population from patients showing clinical benefit. In these examples, immune cell testing occurred at baseline and at time points after one or more cycles of Toca FC.
 Resection Injection Trial Compared to Lomustine External Control
 Patients with GBM at first and second recurrence in our resection injection trial (n=27) were compared to an external control of lomustine-treated patients from a previously-conducted non-surgical Phase 3 clinical trial (database for control arm obtained from the trial sponsor). Surgery is not known to prolong survival in recurrent GBM. Both our resection injection trial and the external control lomustine trial were reasonably contemporaneous (our trial: 2012-2015; lomustine trial: 2006-2010). The characteristics of the patients in these trials were comparable: the external control had a slightly younger population, more patients in first recurrence and a lower percentage of patients requiring corticosteroids at baseline; and our resection injection trial had a higher percentage of patients with a Karnofsky performance status score of 90-100. The Karnofsky score is a 0-100 scale generally used by physicians to quantify a cancer patient’s general well-being and activities of daily life; 100 is “perfect” health and 0 is death. The median overall survival for patients with first or second recurrent GBM in our resection injection trial was 13.6 months (95% CI 11.1, 20) compared to 7.1 months (95% CI 6.01, 8.80) for patients in the external control lomustine trial. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.45 (95% CI 0.27, 0.77; p=0.0028), meaning that with Toca 511 & Toca FC the risk of death was reduced by 55% compared to lomustine. Although the data is not generated from a single randomized trial, use of statistical analysis of the external comparison is only for the purpose of providing context to some of the data collected in our Phase 1 resection injection trial. In the overall survival setting, the hazard ratio is the ratio of the hazard rate (probability of dying during a certain unit time) between two groups. The separation of the survival curves was early and continued through 30 months with overall survival at six months of 96.0% vs. 61.8% (p<0.001). Lomustine is one of the active control treatments for our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.

Intratumoral Injection Trial
 In August 2010, we initiated a Phase 1 multicenter ascending dose clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC to be administered via intratumoral injection in patients with recurrent HGG. A total of 54 patients were enrolled and treated in this study.
 Patients were treated in ascending dose cohorts using two different intratumoral delivery methods. The first method utilized a biopsy needle under stereotactic guidance to concentrate Toca 511 delivery to one location at the advancing edge of the tumor. The second method utilized intraoperative MRI, delivering Toca 511 spread mostly throughout the center of the tumor using convection enhanced delivery over several hours, referred to as non-biopsy needle. Pursuant to the protocol, the patient began a seven-day course of oral Toca FC four weeks following Toca 511 injection and repeats the cycle of Toca FC every five to seven weeks thereafter.
 Delivery of Toca 511 with a biopsy needle in this trial showed a median overall survival of 13.8 months, while delivery via non-biopsy needle showed 9.2 months. Delivery with biopsy needle exceeded the range of 7.1 to 8.5 months, the survival data for currently-approved therapies discussed above. The benefit of biopsy needle delivery compared to non-biopsy needle delivery is statistically significant (p value = 0.0249; indicating that there is a 97.5% probability that the observations are not due to chance alone). In a multivariate analysis controlling for other prognostic factors such as number of recurrences and tumor grade, the delivery method remains statistically significant.

The IRR results as of our data transfer in August 2017 revealed a clinical benefit rate of 32.1%, with 16 of 53 patients (30.2%) showing stable disease. Two patients with stable disease were shown to have an unconfirmed PR (50% tumor shrinkage without subsequent confirmation by MRI). One patient had a confirmed PR, with duration of 7.8 months.
 Intravenous Administration Followed by Resection Injection Trial in 17 Patients
 In February 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 multicenter ascending dose clinical trial in patients with recurrent HGG who are scheduled for resection. Toca 511 was administered initially intravenously on one, three or five consecutive days followed by resection of the tumor with further Toca 511 administration using multiple small injections directly into the mixture of brain and cancer tissue surrounding the resection cavity. Samples of the resected tumor were evaluated for evidence of the presence of Toca 511. Pursuant to the protocol, the patient began a seven day course of oral Toca FC five to seven weeks following the administration of Toca 511 at resection and repeats the cycle of Toca FC every three to five weeks thereafter.
 Following the intravenous delivery of Toca 511, CD protein is detectable and quantifiable in resected HGG tumor tissue. Furthermore, the study shows that Toca 511 can infect and spread in “hot” and “cold” tumors with activity independent of high levels of immunosuppressive T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Median overall survival in the intravenous study was 13.6 months as of April 2017 data cut, consistent with other ascending dose studies (e.g. 14.4 months median overall survival in the resection study). Toca 511 & Toca FC appeared to be well-tolerated with few Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events. An independent radiology review showed one patient with complete radiologic disappearance of all lesions. The results of the intravenous study support evaluation of the regimen in other solid tumors.
 Biomarkers
 As part of our exploration of mutation profiles that may serve as a biomarker for patients with a higher likelihood of long-term benefit, we observed that objective responses occurred in patients with IDH1 mutant (mt) and IDH1 wild type (wt) tumors. Approximately 15% of the population with HGG is believed to have the IDH1 mutation. Across the Phase 1 clinical trial program, and as of August 2017, the three patients with known IDH1 mutations at first recurrence had CRs (two in the resection study and one patient in the intravenous study with a radiologic CR) and all these IDH1 mutation patients are alive (range of survival 12.2 to 35.3 months), suggesting a potential association of IDH1 mutation to survival.
Pooled Safety Data
 Toca 511 & Toca FC has been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. There has been little difference in adverse events among the three Phase 1 clinical trials in recurrent HGG other than a few adverse events unrelated to Toca 511 in the post-operative period of the resection clinical trial. For this reason we chose to pool safety data across the three ascending Phase 1 clinical trials. As shown in the table below, in 127 patients who received Toca 511, treatment-related adverse events were reported in 32.3% of patients and these events were predominantly low grade (25.2%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (11.8%), headache (5.5%) and convulsion (4.7%). Also shown below, in 122 patients who received Toca FC, treatment-related adverse events were reported in 44.3% of patients and these events were predominantly low grade (41.0%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (22.1%), diarrhea (13.9%), and nausea (9.8%). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 6.3% of patients treated with Toca 511 and 2.4% of patients treated with Toca FC (which included pulmonary embolism, diarrhea and intracranial hemorrhage). Hematologic toxicity was infrequent and also low grade. We monitored blood samples for viral RNA and DNA and found that quantitative levels were cleared within two weeks to four months of administration. Also, we analyzed tumor and blood samples for viral insertion sites and demonstrated an absence of clonality, supporting viral safety. We also monitor Toca FC blood levels for the first treatment cycle and whenever the dose is increased. This helps us to adjust dosing upwards in patients with Toca FC blood levels below the target range. The favorable toxicity profile of Toca 511 & Toca FC suggests that combination with other modalities such as chemotherapy or radiation should yield little incremental toxicity.

Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 In November 2015, we initiated the Phase 2 portion of a randomized, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC against the current standard of care in recurrent HGG. In this clinical trial we are using doses of Toca 511 and Toca FC of 4 mL and 220 mg/kg/day, respectively, equivalent to the doses used in the Higher Dose Cohort of our Phase 1 resection injection trial. Enrollment criteria for patients in this clinical trial includes first or second recurrence of HGG, no prior treatment with bevacizumab for recurrent HGG, and a tumor size of less than or equal to five centimeters. We completed enrollment with 187 patients in the Phase 2 portion of this trial as of February 2017. Investigators may choose chemotherapy (lomustine or temozolomide) or antiangiogenic therapy (bevacizumab) for the control arm. We expect that the arms of the trial will be comparable through stratification at the time of 1:1 randomization based on performance status, geographic region and IDH1 mutation status. The primary endpoint for the trial is overall survival. The expected median overall survival for the control arm is 8.5 months based on the assumption that approximately 25% of patients will receive bevacizumab and the remainder will receive chemotherapy in the control arm. In this trial we are evaluating evidence for immunologic mechanisms of disease control and we will perform a detailed molecular analysis of RNA expression, IDH phenotypes and MGMT methylation status in resected tumors. We will continue to monitor blood for viral RNA, DNA and for Toca FC levels. This clinical trial is being conducted in the United States, Canada, Israel and South Korea. The principal investigator in the United States is Timothy Cloughesy, M.D., director of the neuro-oncology program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Because overall survival is the primary endpoint, we did not request a Special Protocol Assessment from the FDA. At our Type B meeting with the FDA in March 2015, we and the FDA discussed the design of the trial and we subsequently finalized the protocol based upon the FDA’s feedback. We also discussed the possibility of providing the data from the Phase 2 portion of this clinical trial to the FDA prior to initiation of the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The FDA indicated that they would be willing to meet with us in an end of Phase 2 meeting to review the data if the results appear compelling.
 In February 2017, the FDA granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of recurrent HGG. In June 2017, the EMA granted Toca 511 PRIME Designation for the treatment of patients with glioma. 
 15

Our PRIME and Breakthrough Therapy Designation application was based on data from three Phase 1 ascending-dose clinical trials involving 127 patients with recurrent brain cancer. The clinical data included results published in Science Translational Medicine, including safety data, patient survival data and data regarding durable, complete or partial tumor shrinkage as determined by independent radiology review. In addition, preclinical information was provided to the FDA supporting a novel immunological mechanism of action involving the depletion of immune-suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation indicates that preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapy Designation intensifies FDA involvement to ensure an efficient drug development program and is an organizational commitment from the FDA to involve its senior managers.
 In October 2017, based on our communications with the FDA under Breakthrough Therapy Designation, we modified the original two-step trial design (Phase 2 followed by Phase 3) into a seamless, Phase 3 pivotal trial, also known as the Toca 5 trial.
 Intravenous Clinical Trial
 In July 2016, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial in various types of metastatic solid cancer, including colorectal, pancreatic, breast, lung and melanoma to confirm the selective tumor transduction with the CD gene and CD protein expression following Toca 511 delivery already documented in HGG with intravenous delivery. New diagnoses of these cancers are estimated to exceed 700,000 per year in the United States and 5.4 million per year worldwide. In our metastatic cancer trial we plan to evaluate safety, presence of Toca 511 genes in tumors of patients with widely-disseminated disease, immunologic activity in blood and tumor such as changes in CD4, CD8 and immune-suppressive myeloid cells, and clinical activity such as tumor response and clinical benefit. We also plan, in this clinical trial, to evaluate Toca 511 & Toca FC in combination with one or more checkpoint inhibitors. Toca 511 will be administered by intravenous injection followed by (1) intratumoral injection following biopsy or (2) injection into the resection cavity wall following planned resection in the case of recurrent HGG or brain metastases.
Planned Clinical Trials
 In 2018, we plan to advance our clinical development plan evaluating Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with newly diagnosed HGG. The primary goals of this study will be to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Toca 511 delivered at the time of resection and Toca FC subsequently delivered in conjunction with radiation and temozolomide.
 Preclinical Studies of Toca 511 and 5-FC
 We believe our preclinical studies support the clinical development of Toca 511 & Toca FC in brain cancers both as a stand-alone regimen and in combination with current treatments. During preclinical testing of Toca 511 we observed that treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC had two powerful mechanisms of action: direct killing of cancer cells and activation of the immune system against the cancer cells. 5-FC, which we use in our preclinical studies, is the active component of the Toca FC tablets we use in humans. 
 Preclinical Studies in Other Cancer Types
 Our pipeline of proprietary programs has the potential to be applicable to a wide variety of cancers. For example, we have demonstrated biodistribution, tumor shrinkage, and long-term survival in colorectal, breast and bladder cancers in preclinical studies, in addition to our brain cancer models with an RRV containing CD and 5-FC.
 Based on preclinical data, we believe Toca 511 & Toca FC has the potential to be effective in treating most cancer types. First, most human cancer cell lines that have been tested are permissive for Toca 511 and sensitive to Toca 511 and 5-FC at clinically relevant concentrations of 5-FC. Also, we have conducted in vivo studies in numerous cancer types, and the studies show that Toca 511 spreads through tumors, including after intravenous infusions into animals with highly-metastatic cancers. For example, in a metastatic colorectal cancer model with numerous lesions in the liver (below left), an RRV containing the GFP gene shows that intravenous administration of RRV is selectively present in the tumor tissue and leaves normal liver uninfected. Tumor metastases are identified by luciferase-based bioluminescence which closely overlays with the location of RRV expressing GFP (below right).

 In this animal model, as in animals with the same colorectal cancer metastases (above) in the brain, Toca 511 and 5-FC caused tumor shrinkage, long-term survival and the generation of anti-tumor immunity sufficient to prevent re-challenge. The treated mice had an apparent 56% cure rate and such animals showed a dramatic decrease in the number of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment and, overall, generated an anti-tumor immune response based on their ability to reject reimplanted tumors. Our treatment mechanism of action of immune activation against cancer is further supported by the ability to provide long-term survival to animals with cancer that receive lymphocytes from animals previously treated with Toca 511 and 5-FC.
 We believe these cell culture and additional animal studies support the view that Toca 511 & Toca FC is generally active against cancer and drives our decision to evaluate this treatment against various types of cancers in clinical trials.
 Manufacturing
 Our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, consists of a biological component and a drug component, which are separately manufactured and are both covered by our proprietary intellectual property. The process for Toca 511 manufacturing and testing has been developed internally and we believe that the process itself and the expertise to design and implement this process as well as the testing are significant assets. The process and the vector composition are covered by patents, patent applications and trade secrets. The process for Toca FC (extended release 5-FC) was also designed internally. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both of these manufacturing processes to produce our final product for clinical use, as currently we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. In addition we utilize contract testing organizations, or CTOs, for the establishment and performance of validated product release assays for Toca 511 & Toca FC material. For Toca FC and Toca 511, we require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and all other applicable laws and regulations. We plan to release material with appropriately qualified assays by our CTOs, who we require to operate under cGMP. We will retain final responsibility for product release and maintain an appropriate quality assurance capability to meet this need. We will continue to rely on CMOs and CTOs to manufacture and perform release testing, respectively, of our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with manufacturers and testing laboratories that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates and testing methods.
 We use a viral producer cell line to create Toca 511 and currently rely on a sole-source CMO to manufacture Toca 511. We believe that our current manufacturing capacity for Toca 511 will be sufficient to support our ongoing and planned clinical trials. We plan to use this CMO for commercial manufacturing and plan to establish a second CMO to support our commercial supply needs.
 Manufacturing for Toca FC generally encompasses both the chemical synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and its formulation and fill/finish of the final product. We currently utilize a single CMO in the United States for the production of the API and a single CMO for the manufacture of the final drug product tablets. We expect these preparations to supply sufficient Toca FC drug substance to complete the planned clinical trials. We believe we have the manufacturing capacity to supply the drug product tablets for our ongoing and planned clinical trials. We plan to use the current API and formulation CMOs for commercial supply.
 We currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing capacity to manufacture Toca 511 or Toca FC.
 License and Collaboration Agreements
 Laboratory Services and License Agreement with Siemens
 In November 2011, we entered into a laboratory services and license agreement with Siemens, which we amended in June 2015, pursuant to which we agreed to engage Siemens (i) to develop and perform certain in vitro diagnostic assays in connection with the 
 17

cancer therapy trials of Toca 511 & Toca FC, (ii) concurrently and/or thereafter, to further develop, obtain FDA approval for, and perform one or more of such in vitro diagnostic assays as drug monitoring diagnostics for Toca 511 & Toca FC as Toca 511 & Toca FC receives marketing approval from the FDA, and (iii) following FDA approval of such in vitro diagnostic assay as a monitoring diagnostic, to perform such in vitro diagnostic monitoring assays as necessary in connection with post-marketing clinical trials of Toca 511 & Toca FC and, if appropriate, as commercial diagnostic tests. We granted Siemens the licensed intellectual property covered by the agreement on an exclusive and non-exclusive basis, depending on Siemens’ use of such intellectual property.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Siemens paid us an initial upfront payment of $0.5 million. Additionally, beginning with the first commercial sale of a product that has received approval for clinical use under the agreement, Siemens will pay us a royalty in the 10-20 percent range of net assay revenue with respect to approved designated assay products and net sales revenue with respect to approved in vitro diagnostic products, until the fifth anniversary of such commercial sale, subject to certain reductions. Beginning with the first commercial sale of Toca 511 or Toca FC, we will pay a royalty to Siemens in the low single-digit percentage range on net product sales of Toca 511 & Toca FC for sales up to the mid-nine-digit dollar range per year, until the fifth anniversary of such commercial sale.
 The term of this agreement will continue until the expiration of all payment obligations. The agreement provides that it may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach remains uncured for 45 days, or in the event the other party files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, is adjudicated as bankrupt or insolvent after all appeals are exhausted, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or fails to discharge or have dismissed within 60 days an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it. If market approval is rejected by the FDA, Siemens must provide us with prompt written notice. Should the parties be unable to reach mutual agreement regarding regulatory strategy within 20 business days of such notice, then either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice to the other party. Siemens may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days prior written notice to us, provided that, notwithstanding such termination, Siemens must continue to provide the laboratory services for any of our trials the protocol for which has been submitted to FDA until the conclusion of such pre-approval trial. Siemens may also terminate the agreement if, after using commercially reasonable efforts, certain assay specifications are not achieved. If Siemens terminates the agreement for breach of contract by us, the licenses granted to Siemens will survive such termination and will become non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable, provided that Siemens will have the right to terminate any such license at any time upon written notice to us. If the agreement expires, or if the agreement is terminated by us for breach of contract by Siemens or for failure to reach an agreement on regulatory strategy, the restriction in the license granted to activities outside of the territory will terminate, and we will have the right to pursue development and commercialization of companion diagnostics for products with one or more other partners in the territory, and to grant to such other partners sublicenses of our rights under the agreement. If the agreement is terminated by either party for failure to reach an agreement on regulatory strategy, or by Siemens by 90 days written notice, for a minimum of 45 days after the later of (i) the termination date or (ii) completion of any required post-termination laboratory services and delivery to us of all results thereof, Siemens must retain any stocks of qualified reagents for the assays that remain as of Siemens’ completion of such laboratory services, and, upon our request made at any time during such 45-day period, Siemens must deliver such remaining stocks to us, provided that we shall have executed documentation reasonably satisfactory to Siemens acknowledging that the use of such reagents is restricted to investigational use pursuant to our IND, and any other use permitted by, and in compliance with, applicable laws, regulatory guidelines and regulatory approvals.
 License Agreement with USC
 In October 2007, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Southern California, or USC, pursuant to which we received a worldwide, exclusive license to, among other things, manufacture and market products utilizing inventions related to our RRV platform and other key technology.
 Under the terms of the agreement, we paid an initial license fee to USC in the low six-digit dollar range and issued to USC shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the low single-digit percent range of all the number of shares of common stock issued at the time shares were issued to our six founders prior to the date of the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we owe USC a royalty in the low single-digit percent range of our and our sub-licensee’s net sales of products covered by the agreement. In addition, we owe USC an additional royalty in the low single-digit percent range of revenue from our sub-licensees. Once our and our sub-licensees net sales reach an amount in the mid-seven digit dollar range, the minimum annual royalty payment due to USC will be in the low six-digit dollar range. Our royalty obligations continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patent covering a licensed product in such country.
 The term of this agreement will continue until all of our royalty payment obligations have expired unless terminated earlier. The agreement provides that it may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach remains uncured for 45 days. We may terminate the agreement without cause upon 45 days’ advance written notice to USC. USC may also terminate the agreement upon notice to us upon (i) the declaration by a court of competent jurisdiction that we are bankrupt and our assets are to be liquidated pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (ii) upon the filing or institution by us of bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership proceedings under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; 
 18

(iii) upon an assignment of a substantial portion of our assets for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) in the event a receiver or custodian is appointed in bankruptcy for all or substantially all of our business; provided, however, that in the case of any involuntary proceeding, such right to terminate shall only become effective if the proceeding is not dismissed within 120 days after the filing thereof. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights granted to or provided by each party to the other shall automatically and irrevocably revert to the granting party.
 Grants
 In August 2017, we were awarded a $2.0 million grant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Orphan Products Development to support our Phase 3 clinical trial, or OOPD Grant. Under the grant agreement, we will be reimbursed for qualifying expenses over a four-year period subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory progress of the trial. At December 31, 2017, we had received $0.5 million relating to the OOPD Grant.
We have also received grants from the following entities: National Institutes of Health, Voices Against Brain Cancer, Musella Foundation, Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, Inc., National Brain Tumor Society, American Brain Tumor Association, Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Research Foundation, and Internal Revenue Service — Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project Program.
 Sales and Marketing
 We currently own exclusive worldwide development and commercial rights to our therapeutic product candidates and underlying viral technology platforms. We plan to build at the appropriate time a commercial infrastructure targeting oncologists, neuro-oncologists and neurosurgeons and related clinicians and health care workers in leading and regional cancer centers in the United States.
 We anticipate that our commercial infrastructure will be built around a “high-touch” model to maximize patient access to our products. In addition to an internal team of dedicated medical sales, marketing, medical affairs, reimbursement, and commercial operations personnel we anticipate leveraging external capabilities such as contract pharmacy services. It is possible that a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy program, or REMS, will be required for our products.
 For our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC for HGG, we have established a base of scientific familiarity with leading physicians in the United States, EU, Canada, South Korea, Israel and Japan. If we obtain regulatory approval, we expect that the base of familiarity we have built with leading international brain cancer centers during the conduct of our clinical trials, including the Toca 5 trial, will help drive market acceptance of our product. We believe that the majority of patients undergoing treatment for HGG in the United States are treated at approximately 60 brain cancer centers in the United States, many of which have participated in our clinical trials. Therefore, we believe a highly specialized, relatively small, medically-focused sales force, in addition to medical science liasons, will be sufficient to support the commercialization of our product.
 Outside the United States, we may build our own commercial infrastructure or consider opportunities to enter into out-licensing or co-promotion agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates outside the United States.
 We currently have very limited sales and marketing or distribution capabilities or in-house personnel specializing in these functions.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties.
 We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through Orphan-Drug Designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 We have obtained Orphan-Drug Designation for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of GBM, which makes the product eligible for a period of orphan drug exclusivity, if approved in this indication, under certain conditions. We believe that approval under a biologics license application, or BLA, will be eligible for 12 years of market exclusivity in the United States, 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe and significant durations in other markets, which would be complementary to any relevant patent exclusivity.
 Through licensing and developing our own portfolio, and as of February 2018, we have rights to thirteen issued patents in the United States, seven of which are assigned to us and six of which are exclusively licensed to us, and 63 issued and granted patents in 
 19

foreign countries, 45 of which are assigned to us and 18 of which are exclusively licensed to us, 11 patent applications in the United States, all of which are assigned to us and 61 patent applications in foreign countries, all of which are assigned to us. We believe that the issued patents will provide coverage on our technology platform and product candidates until approximately 2030. We file intellectual property we believe to be key to our business at a minimum in jurisdictions including the United States, Europe and Japan. Our original core technology was licensed from USC and The Regents of the University of California. Families within the portfolio are directed to our RRV technology platform, the modified CD gene that we use in Toca 511, various other therapeutic modalities and genes for use with RRV, manufacturing methods for RRV, the extended release Toca FC formulation, various combination therapies with Toca 511 & Toca FC and other agents, intravenous administration of RRV and diagnostic assays for detection of RRV.
 We possess significant knowledge relating to the construction, manufacture, development and protection of gene therapy products. Certain intellectual property we aim to protect through a trade secret strategy.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. A wide variety of institutions, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies developing products in immunotherapy and in our lead indication.
 Companies developing other immunotherapy products generally fall within the following categories:
  
• | diversified pharmaceutical companies developing immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors: AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Celgene Corporation, F. Hoffman-La Roche AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi SA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies aimed at stimulating immune responses: Argos Therapeutics, Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., Incyte Corporation, NantKwest, Inc, New Link Genetic Corporation, Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Stemline Therapeutics Inc., and Trillium Therapeutics Inc.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies developing CAR and TCR T cells include: Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Celgene, Inc.), Kite Pharma, Inc. (acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc.) and Novartis AG; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies developing virus-based technology: Amgen, Inc. (Imlygic (talimogene laherparepvec) approved by the FDA in 2015), Vascular Biogenics Ltd, DNAtrix, Inc., Ziopharm Oncology, Inc., Viralytics Ltd and Istari Oncology, Inc.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Approved treatments for HGG or GBM, a subset of HGG, include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the most widely used being temozolomide. Other approved treatments include the carmustine implant (marketed as Gliadel wafer by Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC), bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin by Genentech, Inc.), and NovoCure Limited’s personal electric field device, marketed as Optune (approved for the treatment of GBM). In addition to approved therapies, we expect that Toca 511 & Toca FC will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including nivolumab and ipilimumab (being developed as monocolonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints, PD-1 and CTLA-4, for the treatment of GBM by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; currently in Phase 3 clinical trials), pembrolizumab (being developed as a monocolonal antibody targeting PD-1 for the treatment of GBM by Merck & Co., Inc.; currently in Phase 2 clinical trials), ABT414 (being developed as a monocolonal antibody targeting EGFR for the treatment of GBM by AbbVie Biotherapeutics Corporation; currently in Phase 2 clinical trials), VB-111 (being developed as an antiangiogenic agent delivered with adenovirus for recurrent GBM by Vascular Biogenics Ltd.; currently in Phase 3 clinical trials under a special protocol assessment), VAL-083 (a bi-functional alkylating agent in development for recurrent GBM by DelMar Pharmaceuticals Inc.; currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials), TPI-207 (a 3 rd generation taxane in combination with bevacizumab in development for recurrent GBM by Cortice Biosciences; currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials), martizomib (an alkylating proteasome inhibitor in development for GBM by Celgene Corporation in collaboration with Triphase Accelerator Corporation; currently in Phase 1 clinical trials), Ad-RTS-HIL-12 with veledimex in development for recurrent GBM by Ziopharm Oncology Inc.; currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, SL-701 (a GBM vaccine in development by Stemline Therapeutics Inc.; currently in Phase 2 clinical trials), PVSRIPO (a modified oncolytic polio virus being developed by Istari Oncology, Inc.), and a CAR T cells (being studied in Phase 1 clinical trials by University of Pennsylvania and City of Hope against EGFRvIII and interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2, respectively).
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.
 20

Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the competitive factors that will determine the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety, pricing and reimbursement, and convenience of our product candidates.
 Government Regulation
 Our most advanced product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, is subject to regulation as a combination product in the U.S., which means that it is comprised of both a drug product and a biologic product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different Centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our Toca 511 & Toca FC product candidate, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product, which means that the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, has primary jurisdiction over premarket development. We have had formal communication with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, acknowledging that CBER will be the lead review agency while CDER will be a consulting agency for the Toca FC product component. Accordingly, we are investigating Toca 511 & Toca FC pursuant to a single IND and we plan to seek approval of the combination product through a single BLA. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate marketing authorization for Toca FC, the small molecule drug component of the combination.
 Combination products comprised of biological products, such as gene therapy products, and small molecule drugs, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising, and other promotional practices involving combination products. In the United States, before clinical testing of such combination products, we must submit an IND to the FDA, which reviews the clinical protocol, and the IND must become effective before clinical studies may begin. In some instances, we must also submit our protocols to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, before initiating clinical testing of gene therapy products. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of combination products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Within the FDA, CBER regulates gene therapy products. CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols, including informed consent documents. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing patients involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.
 Ethical, social, and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing, and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies, or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 21

U.S. Combination Products Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product, including our Toca 511 & Toca FC combination product candidate, may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the components of the combination product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of certain preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation has to be submitted to and the clinical trial registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. Current NIH guidelines specify that RAC review of human gene transfer protocols should be limited to cases in which an oversight body, such as an Institutional Biosafety Committee or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, determines that a protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review, and has been determined to meet certain additional criteria. The OBA will notify the FDA and the sponsor of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public.
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, patient selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical 
 22

trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent, which must be signed by each clinical trial patient or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving biological product candidates also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to be ethically administered to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients; gene therapy is usually administered to patients in Phase 1 trials. This is also true in situations where toxicity can only be judged in patients with disease. An evaluation for preliminary evidence of efficacy can be performed at this time. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases, and to generate hypotheses for the dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate further dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe patients for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events with agents such as those we are developing for a period of up to 15 years, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of clinical trial patients.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for expedited reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the sponsor, or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigational product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the components of a combination product as well as finalize processes for manufacturing the components in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the components of a combination product candidate do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of an investigational biologic product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory, and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan Designation has been granted. Currently we have Orphan-Drug Designation for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of GBM. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes annual program fees on prescription drugs or biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the application also includes a non-orphan indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to an initial filing review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in substantial compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites, to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GLP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money, and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently from how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to assess further a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of original standard BLAs within 10 months of the 60 day filing date and 90% of original priority BLAs within six months of the 60 day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are 
 24

subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Orphan-Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan-Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. We have been granted Orphan-Drug Designation by the FDA for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of GBM, which is a subset of HGG, the indication that we are initially pursuing. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. There can be no assurance that we will receive Orphan-Drug Designation for additional indications or for any additional product candidates.
 If a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. The Committee of Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA has designated both flucytosine and vocimagene amiretrorepvec as orphan medicinal products indicated for the treatment of glioma. Orphan designation provides for a full waiver of Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance fees in conjunction with small-medium enterprise.  Also included is a waiver of the fee for a marketing authorization application, and a 10-year market exclusivity upon approval which protects from market competition for similar medicines with similar indications.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has four programs in place intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics intended to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions: Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation.
 The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing a new product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Fast Track Designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. We have received Fast Track Designation of Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of patients with recurrent HGG, to improve their overall survival.
 A new product can receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all of the features of Fast Track Designation in addition to more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient development program, organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for priority review. Specifically, FDA intends to expedite the development and review of a Breakthrough Therapy by, where appropriate, intensively involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review. Where appropriate, FDA also intends to assign a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program. The FDA notes that a compressed drug development program still must generate adequate data to demonstrate that the drug or biologic meets the statutory standard for approval. Omitting components of the development program that are necessary for such a determination can significantly delay, or even preclude, marketing approval.
 25

The FDA has granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of recurrent HGG. Our Breakthrough Therapy Designation application was based on data from three Phase 1 ascending-dose clinical trials involving 126 patients with recurrent brain cancer. The clinical data included results published in Science Translational Medicine, including safety data, patient survival data and data regarding durable, complete or partial tumor shrinkage as determined by independent radiology review. In addition, preclinical information was provided to the FDA supporting a novel immunological mechanism of action involving the depletion of immune-suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation indicates that preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapy Designation intensifies FDA involvement to ensure an efficient drug development program and is an organizational commitment from the FDA to involve its senior managers. We have up to six months after receiving the Breakthrough Therapy Designation to request an Initial Comprehensive Multidisciplinary meeting to discuss the drug development program. This initial meeting is a Type B meeting, used to discuss the overarching, high-level plan for drug development. The discussion will include topics such as planned clinical trials and endpoints, any resizing or adaptations to the trials, plans for expediting the manufacturing development strategy and studies that potentially could be completed after approval. When Breakthrough Therapy Designation has been granted, the FDA is encouraged to meet regularly with the sponsor and subsequent meetings are considered Type B meetings and are established based on the needs of the program.
 The FDA may grant Accelerated Approval to a product candidate for a serious or life-threatening condition upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct adequate and well-controlled additional post-approval trials to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, PRIME Designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development process.
 An application for a product candidate may be eligible to obtain Priority Review Designation if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.  Priority Review Designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the review process.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Maintaining post-approval compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of combination products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production and distribution of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to combination products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of combination products.
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of 
 26

government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register the establishments where the approved products are made with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. As of December 2017 there have been nine biosimilar products approved by the FDA. Two biosimilars have been approved to treat cancer.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 The BPCIA includes, among other provisions:
  
• | A 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of the reference product, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A four-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of the reference product, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An exclusivity period for certain biological products that have been approved through the 351(k) pathway as interchangeable biosimilars;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The BPCIA also establishes procedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical trial.
 27

Additional U.S. Regulation
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, among other things, our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, may affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, the Office of Inspector General, DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. These federal and state laws, which may not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include, among others, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, transparency laws, privacy laws and regulation regarding providing drug samples, sales and marketing activities and our relationships with customers and payors as follows.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, recommending, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, recommendation or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 28

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services, reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes requirements on certain types of entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, such as mandatory contractual terms, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, annually report to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved products to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In many of the markets where we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the United States, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain product approval. A number of gene therapy products have been approved over the past year by the FDA. Although CMS subsequently approved its first method of coverage and reimbursement for one such product, the methodology has been subject to challenge by members of Congress. Often private payers follow the coverage and reimbursement decisions of the Medicare program, and it is difficult to predict how CMS may decide to cover and reimburse our product candidates, once approved, and those determinations are subject to change.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product. Coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process. Additionally, third-party reimbursement may not be available or may not be adequate to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in the European Union, the pricing of biologics is subject to governmental control and other market regulations which could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The Affordable Care Act will impact existing government healthcare programs and may result in the development of new programs.
 Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% starting January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of 
 30

the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. We expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future as the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal year 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further product price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain products under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate product prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic products for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Environmental Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, may affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to influence otherwise a person working in an official capacity.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be subjected to different types of restrictions in different countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the required approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application equivalent to an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may start.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension, or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution in those countries.
