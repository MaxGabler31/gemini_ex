Description of Business
MillerKnoll is a global leader of design. Our brands have led conversations on design for over 100 years, and we continue to drive our industry forward with visionary thinking and a purposeful approach. The Company's principal business consists of the research, design, manufacture, selling and distribution of seating products, office furniture systems, other freestanding furniture elements, textiles, leather, felt, home furnishings and related services. 

The Company's ingenuity and design excellence create award-winning products and services, which have made the Company a leader in the design and development of furniture, furniture systems, textiles, leather, felt and related technology and acoustical solutions. This leadership is exemplified by the innovative concepts introduced by the Company in its broad array of product offerings. 
The Company's products are marketed worldwide by its own sales staff, independent dealers and retailers, via its eCommerce websites, and through its owned Herman Miller, Design Within Reach ("DWR"), HAY, Knoll, and Muuto retail stores and studios. Salespeople work with dealers, the architecture and design community, and directly with end-users. Independent dealerships concentrate on the sale of MillerKnoll products and some complementary product lines of other manufacturers. It is estimated that approximately 58.1% of the Company's sales in the fiscal year ended May 28, 2022, were made to or through independent dealers. The remaining sales were made directly to end-users, including federal, state and local governments and several business organizations by the Company's own sales staff, retail channels, or independent retailers. 
The Company is a recognized leader within its industry for the use, development, and integration of customer-centered technologies that enhance the reliability, speed, and efficiency of our customers' operations. This includes proprietary sales tools, interior design and product specification software, order entry and manufacturing scheduling and production systems, and direct connectivity to the Company's suppliers.
The Company's furniture systems, seating, freestanding furniture, storage, casegoods, textile products, leather, felt, acoustic products and related services are used in (1) institutional environments including offices and related conference, lobby, and lounge areas and general public areas including transportation terminals; (2) health/science environments including hospitals, clinics and other healthcare facilities; (3) industrial and educational settings; and (4) residential and other environments. 
Raw Materials
The Company's manufacturing materials are available from a significant number of sources within North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The costs of certain direct materials used in the Company's manufacturing and assembly operations are sensitive to shifts in commodity market prices. In particular, the costs of steel, plastic, aluminum components and particleboard are sensitive to the market prices of commodities such as raw steel, aluminum, crude oil, lumber and resins. Increases in the market prices for these commodities can have an adverse impact on the Company's profitability. Further information regarding the impact of direct material costs on the Company's financial results is provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this report, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 
Patents and Trademarks
The Company believes its intellectual property rights are an important component supporting the long-term success of its brands and its competitive position, and it strategically applies for, registers, and maintains its intellectual property rights in the United States and a number of foreign countries where such protection is available. These rights include patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets, among other proprietary rights. The Company also maintains a robust intellectual property enforcement program to protect its intellectual property rights against third party infringers.
The Company and its subsidiaries hold many active utility and design patents in the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries. The Company has also registered various trademarks, including the name and stylized “Herman Miller” trademark, the “Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M” trademark, and the name and stylized “Knoll” trademark in the United States and many foreign countries, which it considers to be among its most valuable intellectual property rights.
The Company considers the following trademarks and any associated stylized depictions of the word marks to be among its most important trademarks for distinguishing the Company, its subsidiaries and its goods from those of others: MillerKnollTM, Herman Miller®, Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M®, Knoll®, Maharam®, Geiger®, Design Within Reach®, DWR®, HAY®, naughtone®, Nemschoff®, Aeron®, Mirra®, Embody®, Setu®, Sayl®, Cosm®, Caper®, Eames®, Knoll®, KnollExtra®, Knoll Luxe®, KnollStudio®, KnollTextiles®, Edelman® Leather, Spinneybeck® Leather, Generation by Knoll®, Regeneration by Knoll®, MultiGeneration by Knoll®, Remix®, Holly Hunt®, Vladimir Kagan®, Muuto®, Fully®, Barcelona®, Womb®, as well as trademark registrations for trade dress and common law rights in trade dress for some of the Company’s significant product designs.
Working Capital Practices
Information concerning the Company's working capital levels relative to its sales volume can be found under the Executive Overview section in Item 7 of this report, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Beyond this discussion, the Company does not believe that it or the industry in general has any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding the Company's business.
Customer Base
The Company approximates that no single dealer accounted for more than 2% of the Company's net sales in the fiscal year ended May 28, 2022. The Company estimates that the largest single end-user customer accounted for $114.4 million, $113.0 million and $122.9 million of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. This represents approximately 3% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2022 and 5% in 2021 and 2020. The Company's ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 11% of net sales in fiscal 2022 and 17% and 18% of net sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Backlog of Unfilled Orders
As of May 28, 2022, the Company's backlog of unfilled orders was $932.5 million. At May 29, 2021, the Company's backlog totaled $446.9 million. The increase in backlog was due primarily to the Knoll acquisition, which contributed backlog of $293.3 million as well as from growth in order volume in excess of sales for the remainder of the business. It is expected that substantially all of the orders forming the backlog at May 28, 2022 will be filled during the next fiscal year. Many orders received by the Company are reflected in the backlog for only a short period while other orders request extended delivery dates and are carried in the backlog for up to one year. Accordingly, the backlog at any particular time does not necessarily indicate the level of net sales for a particular succeeding period.
Government Contracts
Other than standard provisions contained in contracts with the United States Government, the Company does not believe that any significant portion of its business is subject to material renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of various government entities. The Company sells to the U.S. Government both through General Services Administration ("GSA") Multiple Award Schedule Contracts and through competitive bids. The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Contract pricing is principally based upon the Company's commercial price list in effect when the contract is initiated, rather than being determined on a cost-plus-basis. The Company is required to receive GSA approval to apply list price increases during the term of the Multiple Award Schedule Contract period.
Competition
All aspects of the Company's business are highly competitive. From an office furniture perspective, the Company competes largely on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery and product pricing. Although the Company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the world, it competes with manufacturers that have significant resources and sales as well as many smaller companies. The Company's most significant competitors are Haworth, HNI Corporation, Kimball International, Inc., and Steelcase Inc. 
The Company also competes in the home furnishings industry, primarily against national, regional and independent home furnishings retailers who market high-craft furniture to end-user customers and the interior design community. These competitors include companies such as Crate & Barrel Holdings, Inc., Hive Modern, Restoration Hardware, Room & Board, Inc., Wayfair Inc., and Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Similar to its office furniture product offerings, the Company competes primarily on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery and product pricing in this market.
On July 19, 2021, the acquisition of Knoll, Inc. was completed. For further discussion about the acquisition of Knoll, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
Research, Design and Development
The Company believes it draws great competitive strength from its research, design and development programs. Through research, the Company seeks to understand, define and clarify customer needs and problems they are trying to solve. The Company designs innovative products and services that address customer needs and solve their problems. The Company uses both internal and independent research and design resources. Exclusive of royalty payments, the Company spent approximately $71.1 million, $50.8 million and $54.3 million on design and research activities in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Generally, royalties are paid to designers of the Company's products as the products are sold and are included in the Design and research line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Environmental Matters
The Company believes that a business must stand for more than just its products and services and the Company's people around the globe share a commitment to using business as a force for good. 
Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations and execution of the Company's sustainability strategy will increase costs for the Company. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the Company in ways which we cannot predict at this time.
The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. The Company’s commitment to the planet is embedded in its corporate strategy and will continue to develop as the Company outlines next steps in its sustainability strategy. As part of this commitment, the Company focuses on operating its global footprint with minimal impact on the environment and designing products with materials and processes that are safe for both people and the planet.
Human Resources
The Company considers its employees to be another of its major competitive strengths. The Company stresses individual employee participation and incentives, believing that this emphasis has helped attract and retain a competent and motivated workforce. The Company's human resources group provides employee recruitment, education and development, as well as compensation planning and counseling. Additionally, there have been no work stoppages or labor disputes in the Company's history. As of May 28, 2022, approximately 2% of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are employees located in Wisconsin, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Brazil.
As of May 28, 2022, the Company had approximately 11,300 employees, which is approximately 3,100 higher since May 29, 2021 due to the acquisition of Knoll. In addition to its employee workforce, the Company uses temporary labor to meet fluctuating demand in its manufacturing operations.
Diversity and Inclusion
At MillerKnoll, our differences contribute to our success. We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") and creating opportunities for people who come from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, gender identities, LGBTQ+, people with differing abilities, those with military backgrounds, as well as those who are reentering the workforce for a variety of reasons. We are committed to ensuring equity exists for all persons to thrive, and we focus on building diverse leadership across MillerKnoll. We believe that embracing diverse perspectives contributes to an inclusive workplace and strengthens the communities where we live and work. 
We continue to build DEI into our everyday practices by focusing on:
•An ongoing commitment to educate ourselves and integrate cultural competency across the organization
•Recruiting, developing, retaining, and promoting diverse talent through targeted plans that drive better results in this area
•Implementing and taking action on appropriate metrics and measures to hold ourselves accountable to our commitments
Compensation
The Company's policy is to competitively compensate all employees for their contributions to MillerKnoll, Inc. and to appropriately reward and motivate employees to deliver our business goals. We do this, in part, by closely monitoring and benchmarking compensation matters and working to ensure that our programs provide our associates with the right features to provide for their families and prepare for retirement. We provide competitive health and welfare benefits and retirement savings plans (401k), with matching employer contributions. Retention of our talent is exceedingly important and drives how we design our programs.
