 Item 1. Business
 
General
 
Expro Group Holdings N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company (Naamloze Vennootschap) and includes the activities of Expro Group Holdings International Limited, Frank’s International C.V. and their wholly owned subsidiaries (either individually or together, as context requires, “Expro,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”).
 
On March 10, 2021, the Company and New Eagle Holdings Limited, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Expro Group Holdings International Limited (“Legacy Expro”) providing for the merger of Legacy Expro with and into Merger Sub in an all-stock transaction, with Merger Sub surviving the merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The Merger closed on October 1, 2021, and the Company, previously known as Frank’s International N.V. (“Frank’s”), was renamed Expro Group Holdings N.V. The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Legacy Expro being identified as the accounting acquirer. The historical financial statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of only Legacy Expro for all periods prior to the Merger and of the combined company (including activities of Frank’s) for all periods subsequent to the Merger.

Well Management
---------------


Our well management offerings consist of well flow management, subsea well access and well intervention and integrity services:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well flow management: We gather valuable well and reservoir data, with a particular focus on well-site safety and environmental impact. We provide global, comprehensive well flow management systems for the safe production, measurement and sampling of hydrocarbons from a well during the exploration and appraisal phase of a new field; the flowback and clean-up of a new well prior to production; and in-line testing of a well during its production life. We also provide early production facilities to accelerate production; production enhancement packages to enhance reservoir recovery rates through the realization of production that was previously locked within the reservoir; and metering and other well surveillance technologies to monitor and measure flow and other characteristics of wells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Subsea well access: With over 35 years of experience providing a wide range of fit-for-purpose subsea well access solutions, our technology aims to ensure safe well access and optimized production throughout the lifecycle of the well. We provide what we believe to be the most reliable, efficient and cost-effective subsea well access systems for exploration and appraisal, development, intervention and abandonment, including an extensive portfolio of standard and bespoke Subsea Test Tree Assemblies, a rig-deployed Intervention Riser System and a vessel-deployed, wire through water Riserless Well Intervention System. We also provide systems integration and project management services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well intervention and integrity: We provide well intervention solutions to capture well data, ensure well bore integrity and improve production. In addition to our extensive fleet of mechanical and cased hole wireline units, we have recently introduced a number of cost-effective, innovative well intervention services, including CoilHose™, a lightweight, small-footprint solution for wellbore lifting, cleaning and chemical treatments; Octopoda™, for fluid treatments in wellbore annuli; and Galea™, an autonomous well intervention solution. We also possess several other distinct technical capabilities, including non-intrusive metering technologies and wireless telemetry systems for reservoir monitoring.

Human Capital
 
At Expro, people are at the heart of our success and we are united by our Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) and our core values; People, Performance, Partnerships, and Planet. We are committed to living our values through corporate responsibility efforts that help people across the globe live better lives and build sustainable, vibrant, stable communities where highly motivated people can engineer futures. We strive to consistently improve the ways in which we work to keep our employees safe, minimize our impact on the environment and ensure our governance is robust and transparent.
 
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,200 employees worldwide. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements or other similar arrangements in certain international areas in which we operate. At December 31, 2021, approximately 18% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, with 12% being under agreements that expire within one year. We consider our relations with our employees to be positive. In the United States, most employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Outside the United States, the Company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. Based upon the geographic diversification of our employees, we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
At Expro, we strive to be a safe, diverse and inclusive people-focused company that positively impacts local communities and society. Most people recognize the importance of diversity at work and the benefits it can bring to the organization and its people. However, diversity is only half of the story. The other half is inclusion: building a work environment in which people feel valued for who they are, bring their whole selves to work and contribute fully. In an inclusive work environment, people with different backgrounds, religious beliefs, sexual orientations, ethnicity and other differences feel like they belong.
  We strive to ensure the equal treatment of all employees, job applicants and associated personnel regardless of race, color, nationality, ethnic or nation originals, sex, disability, age, religion or belief, or any other factors prohibited by law. We aim to create a work environment free of harassment and bullying, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
  Diversity and inclusiveness are important to our current and future success by providing varied experiences, ideas and insights to inform decisions, identify new approaches and solve business challenges. Our goal is to put the right people forward to do the right work for the right customers, in the right places, attracting, retaining and nurturing a talented and diverse workforce to turn our growth ambitions into reality.
 
Employee Learning and Development
 
We demonstrate our commitment to our values through our employee development initiatives. We invest in our people through learning and development programs that reinforce and update existing skill sets, and which develop employees’ competencies into new and complementary areas of expertise. Employees are empowered to drive their career progression through various learning platforms to facilitate achievement and career progression. A key tenet of our development is our strong performance management culture that enables and informs management development plans and succession planning.
 
We also actively solicit employee feedback and constantly strive to make the Company an employer of choice. We empower employees with an ownership mindset that encourages accountability and creativity – leading to new and better solutions.
 
Employee Welfare and Development
 
We offer opportunities for a challenging career in an energetic and friendly work environment. Providing our workforce with a career path, training, fair pay, and challenging, rewarding work are key tenets of our success. Our benefit packages are tailored to the local market of operation and are designed to attract and retain the best talent in the industry.

Safety
 
Safety is a critical component of our People and Performance core values. Many of our customers have safety standards we must satisfy before we can perform services. We continually monitor and improve our safety performance through the evaluation of safety observations, job and customer surveys, and safety data. The primary measures for our safety performance are the tracking of the Lost Time Injury Frequency rate (“LTIF”) and the Total Recordable Case Frequency rate (“TRCF”). LTIF is a measure of the frequency of injuries that result in lost work time, normalized on the basis of per million man-hours worked. TRCF is a measure of the frequency of recordable workplace injuries, normalized on the basis of per million man-hours worked. A recordable injury includes occupational death, nonfatal occupational illness, and other occupational injuries that involve loss of consciousness, lost time injuries, restriction of work or motion cases, transfer to another job, or medical treatment cases other than first aid.
 
The table below presents the combined worldwide LTIF and TRCF for Legacy Expro and Frank’s for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----+-------------------------+-----
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
LTIF | | 0.46 | | 0.34 | | 0.54
TRCF | | 1.31 | | 1.34 | | 1.78

 
We have comprehensive compliance policies, programs and training that are applied globally to our entire workforce. Employees are required to complete Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) trainings to adhere to safe and responsible work environments. We also standardize our global training processes to ensure all jobs are executed to high standards of safety and quality.
 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 
We pledge to be forthright in all our business interactions and conduct our business to the highest ethical standards. That commitment extends to strict compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and business standards. We have comprehensive compliance programs and policies that are applied globally to our entire workforce. Our ethical foundation is our Code of Conduct, the provisions of which all employees are expected to understand and comply with. Our compliance and ethics policies undergo regular review.
 
We require every employee worldwide to complete an online Code of Conduct training course every year, which addresses conflicts of interest, confidentiality, fair dealing with others, proper use of company assets, compliance with laws, insider trading, maintenance of books and records, zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment in the work environment, as well as reporting of violations. 
 
Suppliers and Raw Materials
 
We acquire component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including foundries, forge shops, and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain equipment utilized within our product lines are only available from a limited number of suppliers.
 
    6 

  

Our ability to source low cost raw materials and components, such as steel castings and forgings, is critical to our ability to manufacture our products competitively. In order to purchase raw materials and components in a cost effective manner, we have sought to develop a broad international sourcing capability and we maintain quality assurance and testing programs to analyze and test these raw materials and components.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own and control a variety of intellectual property, including patents, proprietary information, trade secrets and software tools and applications. We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have a number of pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license as critical or essential to our business as a whole.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of our products and services and otherwise impact our business. For example, the winter months in the North Sea and the monsoon season in South and Southeast Asia can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns may result in higher or lower activity in the fourth quarter of the year based on year-to-date spending relative to their approved annual budgets and higher or lower activity in the first quarter of the year based on whether or not the new year’s budget has been approved.
Customers
 
We derive our revenue from services and product sales to customers primarily in the oil and gas industry. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. One customer in our MENA segment accounted for 16% and 14% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are competitive. We compete with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources greater than ours. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we participate include the technologies and solutions offered, the quality, price and availability of products and services, safety and service quality, operating footprint and responsiveness to customer needs.
 
We believe several factors support our strong competitive position. Our portfolio of technology-enabled products and services fulfill a wide range of our customers’ requirements. We also seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a high level of customer service, by providing innovative products and solutions and by supporting our customers on a global basis. Finally, our quality assurance systems, experienced personnel and track record all support a strong reputation for safe operations, environmental stewardship, compliance with laws and ethical commercial engagement.

Governmental Regulations
 
We are subject to numerous environmental and other governmental and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide.
 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 
 
Our operations are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations governing the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective actions, the required incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, and the imposition of orders or injunctions to prohibit or restrict certain activities or force future compliance.
 
Certain environmental laws may impose joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The trend in environmental regulation is to typically place more stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 
Climate Change
 
Climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and other countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the transport of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.
 
    8 

  

Separately, various governments have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is a non-binding agreement, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. While the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement under the Trump Administration, effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. Under the Paris Agreement, the Biden Administration has committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 - 52% from 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the Unites States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy. With the United States recommitting to the Paris Agreement, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement’s goals.
 
There are also increasing risks of litigation related to climate change effects. Governments and third-parties have brought suit against some fossil fuel companies alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by marketing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. Similar or more demanding cases are occurring in other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, in December 2019, the High Council of the Netherlands ruled that the government of the Netherlands has a legal obligation to decrease the country’s GHG emissions, and in May 2021, the Hague District Court ordered Royal Dutch Shell plc to reduce its worldwide emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. Such litigation has the potential to adversely affect the production of fossil fuels, which in turn could result in reduced demand for our services.
 
Financial risks also exist for fossil fuel producers (and companies that provide products and services to fossil fuel producers) as shareholders who are currently invested in such fossil fuel companies but are concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into other sectors. Banks and institutional lenders that provide financing to fossil fuel companies (and their suppliers and service providers) also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel companies. Additionally, in recent years, the practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts not to provide funding for such companies. Oftentimes this pressure has been public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of production of crude oil and natural gas, which could in turn decrease demand for our services. Our own operations could also face limitations on access to capital as a result of these trends, which could adversely affect our business and results of operation.
 
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services and products. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons, and therefore for our products and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues. Over time, one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice in the oil and gas industry. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production of hydrocarbons. While we may provide supporting products through our cementing product offering, we do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our onshore customers utilize this technique. Certain environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies have suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and have made claims that hydraulic fracturing techniques are harmful to surface water and drinking water resources and may cause earthquakes. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly or indirectly. Additionally, states and local governments may also seek to limit hydraulic fracturing activities through time, place, and manner restrictions on operations or ban the process altogether. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs that restrict hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect, reduce or delay well drilling and completion activities, increase the cost of drilling and production, and thereby reduce demand for our services. There also exists the potential for states and local governments to pursue new or amended laws, regulations, executive actions and other regulatory initiatives that could impose more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including potential restrictions on hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands.
 
    9 

  

Offshore Regulatory and Marine Safety
 
Spurred on by environmental and safety concerns, governing bodies from time to time have pursued moratoria and legislation or regulatory initiatives that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas, including areas where we or our oil and gas exploration and production customers conduct operations such as on the federal Outer Continental Shelf waters in the United States Gulf of Mexico.
Employee Health and Safety
 
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
 
We also operate in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may impose similar legal requirements. Historically, our environmental and worker safety costs to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on us. However, we believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards and, thus, we cannot give any assurance that such costs will not materially adversely affect us in the future.
 
Operating Risk and Insurance
 
We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses.
 
Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery. We generally do not procure or maintain business interruption insurance.
