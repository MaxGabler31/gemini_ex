ITEM 1.            BUSINESS
Overview
Advanced Energy provides highly engineered, mission-critical, precision power conversion, measurement, and control solutions to our global customers. We design, manufacture, sell, and support precision power products that transform, refine, and modify the raw electrical power coming from either the utility or the building facility and convert it into various types of highly controllable, usable power that is predictable, repeatable, and customizable to meet the necessary requirements for powering a wide range of complex equipment. Our power solutions enable innovation in complex semiconductor and thin film plasma processes such as dry etch, strip and deposition, high and low voltage applications such as semiconductor process control, data center computing, networking, telecommunication, medical equipment, life science applications, industrial technology and production, scientific instruments, clean technology production, advanced material production and temperature-critical thermal. We also supply related sensing, controls, and instrumentation products for advanced measurement and calibration of radio frequency (“RF”) power and temperature, and electrostatic instrumentation products for test and measurement applications. Our network of global service support centers provides a recurring revenue opportunity as we offer repair services, conversions, upgrades, refurbishments, and used equipment to companies using our products. 
Our products are sold into the Semiconductor Equipment, Industrial and Medical, Data Center Computing, and Telecom and Networking markets, and we provide revenue data by market vertical to enable tracking of trends. Advanced Energy is organized on a global, functional basis and operates in a single segment structure for power electronics conversion products. 
At the beginning of 2020 we saw the spread of COVID-19, which grew into a global pandemic. Our focus on providing a healthy and safe working environment for our employees led to intermittent shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities to implement new health and safety protocols and additional investments to comply with government guidelines. During 2020 and 2021 there were periods when some of our manufacturing facilities were not operating or were operating at reduced capacity due to government mandates to restrict travel, maintain social distancing, and implement health and safety procedures. Additionally, during 2021, ongoing restrictions related to COVID-19 and disruptions in an already challenged global supply chain limited the availability of certain materials, parts, subcomponents, and subassemblies needed for production, impacting our ability to ship product to meet customer demand and contributing to increased backlog. The shortage of critical components was caused in part by the pandemic-driven rise in consumer demand for technology goods, increased demand for electronic components used in a wide variety of industries, logistics-related disruptions in shipping, capacity limitations at some suppliers due to COVID-19, its variants, labor shortages, and other factors. We expect the challenges associated with this environment to continue into 2022.

Although COVID-19 impacted our revenues and manufacturing efficiency over the last two years, COVID-19 has not materially impacted our liquidity, our ability to access capital, our ability to comply with our debt covenants or the fair value of our assets. Additionally, we believe the accommodations we have made to our work environment, including employees utilizing work-from-home arrangements where necessary, will not impact our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
Looking forward, we expect that customer demand in 2022 will remain strong across our served markets; however, our ability to procure critical components to meet our customers’ needs will continue to be limited by the ongoing constraints in the global supply chain. These supply constraints have led to longer lead times in procuring materials and subcomponents and, in some cases, higher costs and inventory level requirements. We have implemented measures to improve supply of critical materials and components and to mitigate the impact of higher input costs and believe that our higher levels of inventory are well matched to meet our shippable customer demand. However, it is not clear how long this supply chain condition will continue, how quickly it may recover, or the extent to which our mitigating actions will be able to improve supply or to compensate for our higher costs. As such, our forward-looking projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow may be adversely impacted if the situation continues or further deteriorates. Please see the information under the caption "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on the potential impacts of the ongoing constraints in the global supply chain and COVID-19 to the future operations of our business. 
We incorporated in Colorado in 1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1995. Our executive offices are located at 1595 Wynkoop Street, Suite 800, Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (970) 407-6555.

The majority of our markets are not generally subject to significant seasonality; however, these markets are cyclical due to changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. Other factors, such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in the applications we serve can also have an impact on our financial results, both positively and negatively. For more information related to the markets in which we compete and the current environment in those markets, see Business Environment and Trends in Part II, Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MARKET
Growth in the Semiconductor Equipment market is driven by increasing integrated circuit content across many industries, higher demand for processing and storage in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and autonomous vehicles, and the rapid adoption of advanced mobile connectivity solutions, such as 5G, which enhances existing and enables new wireless applications. To address the long-term growing demand for semiconductor devices, the industry continues to invest in production capacities for both leading-edge and trailing-edge nodes, logic devices, the latest memory devices including 3D-NAND, DRAM, and new emerging memories such as MRAM, and back-end test and advanced wafer-level packaging. The industry’s transition to advanced technology nodes in logic and DRAM and to increased layers in 3D-NAND memory devices require an increased number of plasma-based etch and deposition process tools and higher content of our advanced power solutions per tool. As etching and deposition processes become more challenging due to increasing aspect ratios in advanced 3D devices, more advanced RF, and DC technologies are needed. We are meeting these challenges by providing a broader range of more complex RF and DC power solutions. Beyond etch and deposition processes, the growing complexity at the advanced nodes also drive a higher number of other processes across the wafer fab, including inspection, metrology, thermal, ion implantation, and semiconductor test, where Advanced Energy actively participates as a critical technology provider. In addition, our global support services group offers comprehensive local repair service, upgrade, and retrofit offerings to extend the useable life of our customers’ capital equipment for additional technology generations.

​
See Item 1A "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations.

Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our products is primarily performed at our major sites in the PRC, Philippines, and Malaysia. In addition, we perform limited specialty manufacturing for some of our products in the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany, and Denmark. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks related to our manufacturing operations. 

Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to our specifications. We use numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, some key parts may be obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. During 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 impacted the availability of materials, parts, and subcomponents needed for production. In some cases, we paid premiums or expedite fees to obtain critical parts to meet urgent customer needs. In many instances, we passed these additional costs along to our customers. We expect the related supply chain challenges will continue into 2022. However, we seek to reduce costs, lower the risks of production and service interruptions, and mitigate key parts shortages by:

● | selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts using rigorous technical and commercial evaluation of suppliers’ products and business processes including testing their components’ performance, quality, and reliability on our power conversion product at our customers’ and their customers’ processes. The qualification process for our process power products, particularly as it pertains to semiconductor customers, follows semiconductor industry standard practices, such as "copy exact";
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | monitoring the financial condition and overall performance of key suppliers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts, including making last time purchases of key parts when notified by suppliers that they are ending the supply of those parts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | qualifying new parts where possible and in geographies that reduce costs without degradation in quality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | competitively sourcing parts through electronic bidding tools to ensure the lowest total cost is achieved for the parts needed in our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
We seek patent protection for inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research and development. We currently hold 325 U.S. issued patents and 419 foreign issued patents, and we have 429 patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Most patents are active for 20 years, and our patents expire on various dates through 2040. A substantial majority of our patents are related to our process power products and solutions business. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the industrialized countries within Europe and Asia because there are other manufacturers and developers of power conversion and control systems in those countries, as well as customers for those systems for which our intellectual property applies. We leverage our proprietary technology and trade secrets to deliver on our strategy of selling differentiated products for our most important customer solutions.
Litigation may, from time to time, be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. See "We are highly dependent on our intellectual property" in Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological development and changing customer requirements. We face a wide variety of competitors, and no single company dominates any of our markets. Significant competitive factors in our markets include product performance, compatibility with adjacent products, price, quality, reliability, and level of customer service and support.
We encounter substantial competition from foreign and domestic companies for each of our product lines. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In some cases, competitors are smaller than we are, but are well established in specific product niches. Competitors in each of our market verticals include, but are not limited to, the following: 

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition, a focus on local content is causing new competitors to emerge around the world, with strong support from local governments, industry leaders, and investors. Our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to make timely introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, to localize these development and production activities in key world regions close to our customers, and to produce high quality products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with competitive performance characteristics. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to these factors, although we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively in the future.

11



Research and Development
We perform research and development ("R&D") of products to develop new or emerging applications, technological advances to provide higher performance, lower cost, or other attributes that we may expect to advance our customers’ products. We believe that continued development of technological applications, as well as enhancements to existing products and related software to support customer requirements, are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, and we expect these investments to continue.
