 ITEM 1.      Business
 General
 Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company, incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1981, that conducts business through its subsidiaries. Founded in 1937, we are one of the oldest mutual fund complexes in the United States, having introduced the Waddell & Reed Advisors group of mutual funds (the “Advisors Funds”) in 1940. Over time we’ve added additional mutual funds: Ivy Funds (the “Ivy Funds”); Ivy Variable Insurance Portfolios, our variable product offering (“Ivy VIP”); InvestEd Portfolios, our 529 college savings plan (“InvestEd”); Ivy High Income Opportunities Fund, a closed-end mutual fund (“IVH”); the Ivy Global Investors Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable (the “SICAV”) and its Ivy Global Investors sub‑funds (the “IGI Funds”), an undertaking for the collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”); and the Ivy NextShares® exchange-traded managed funds (“Ivy NextShares”) (collectively, the Advisors Funds, Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP, InvestEd, IVH and Ivy NextShares are referred to as the “Funds”). In February 2018, we completed the merger of all Advisors Funds into Ivy Funds with substantially similar objectives and strategies. In May 2018, we started the process of liquidating the IGI Funds, which was substantially complete in 2018.  In addition to the Funds and IGI Funds, our assets under management (“AUM”) include institutional accounts managed by the Company.
 We derive our revenues from providing investment management and advisory services, investment product underwriting and distribution, and shareholder services administration to the Funds, institutional accounts, and the IGI Funds prior to their liquidation. We also provide brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through Waddell & Reed, Inc. (“W&R”), and independent financial advisors associated with W&R (“Advisors”), who provide financial planning and advice to their clients. Investment management and advisory fees and certain underwriting and distribution revenues are based on the level of AUM and assets under administration (“AUA”) and are affected by sales levels, financial market conditions, redemptions and the composition of assets. Our underwriting and distribution revenues consist of fees earned on fee‑based asset allocation programs and related advisory services, asset‑based service and distribution fees promulgated under the 1940 Act (“Rule 12b-1”), distribution fees on certain variable products, and commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products. The products sold have various commission structures and the revenues received from those sales vary based on the type and dollar amount sold. Shareholder service fee revenue includes transfer agency fees, custodian fees from retirement plan accounts, portfolio accounting and administration fees, and is earned based on client AUM or number of client accounts.  Our major expenses are for distribution of our products, compensation related costs, occupancy, general & administrative, and information technology.

 Organization
 We deliver our investment management advisory services through our subsidiary companies, primarily Ivy Investment Management Company (“IICO”), the registered investment adviser for the Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP, InvestEd, and Ivy NextShares; and, prior to completion of the Advisors Funds mergers into Ivy Funds in 2018, Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (“WRIMCO”), a registered investment adviser for the Advisors Funds. WRIMCO merged into IICO, effective December 31, 2018.  
 Our underwriting and distribution services are delivered through our two broker-dealers: W&R and Ivy Distributors, Inc. (“IDI”). W&R is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser that acts as the national distributor and underwriter for shares of InvestEd, other mutual funds, and the former Advisors Funds, and as a distributor of variable annuities and other insurance products issued by our business partners. IDI is the distributor and underwriter for the Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP and Ivy Nextshares.
 Waddell & Reed Services Company (“WRSCO”) provides transfer agency and accounting services to the Funds. Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc., W&R, WRIMCO, WRSCO, IICO and IDI are hereafter collectively referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” unless the context requires otherwise.
 Investment Management Operations
 Our investment management and advisory services provide one of our largest sources of revenues. We earn investment management fee revenues by providing investment management and advisory services pursuant to investment management agreements with the Funds. While the specific terms of the agreements vary, the basic terms are similar. The agreements provide that we render overall investment management services to each of the Funds, subject to the oversight of each Fund’s board of trustees and in accordance with each Fund’s investment objectives and policies. The agreements permit us to enter into separate agreements for shareholder services or accounting services with each respective Fund.
 Each Fund’s board of trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund or the Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “ICA”) (“disinterested members”) and the Fund’s shareholders must approve the investment management agreement between the respective Fund and the Company. These agreements may continue in effect from year to year if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the Fund’s board, including a majority of the disinterested members, or (ii) the vote of a majority of both the shareholders of the Fund and the disinterested members of each Fund’s board, each vote being cast in person at a meeting called for such purpose. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined by the ICA or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and may be terminated without penalty by any Fund by giving us 60 days’ written notice if the termination has been approved by a majority of the Fund’s trustees or the Fund’s shareholders. We may terminate an investment management agreement without penalty on 120 days’ written notice.
 In addition to performing investment management services for the Funds, we act as an investment adviser for institutional and other private investors and we provide subadvisory services to other investment companies.  We also acted as investment advisor to the IGI Funds prior to their liquidation. Such services are provided pursuant to various written agreements, and our fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM.
 Our investment management team begins each business day in a collaborative discussion that fosters idea sharing, yet reinforces individual accountability. Through all market cycles, we remain dedicated to the following investment principles:

· | Rigorous fundamental research—an enduring investment culture that dedicates itself to analyzing companies on our own rather than relying exclusively on widely available research produced by others.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Collaboration and accountability—a balance of collaboration and individual accountability, which ensures the sharing and analysis of investment ideas among investment professionals while empowering portfolio managers to shape their portfolios individually.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on growing and protecting client assets—a sound approach that seeks to capture asset appreciation when market conditions are favorable and strives to manage risk during difficult market periods.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These three principles shape our investment philosophy and money management approach. For over 80 years, our investment organization has delivered consistently competitive investment performance. Through bull and bear markets, our investment professionals have not strayed from what works—fundamental research and a time‑tested investment process. We believe long-term clients turn to us because they appreciate that our investment approach continues to identify and create opportunities for wealth creation.
 Our investment management team is comprised of 89 professionals, including 32 portfolio managers who average 23 years of industry experience and 16 years of tenure with our firm. We have significant experience in virtually all major asset classes, several specialized asset classes and a range of investment styles. We continue to move towards team-based portfolio management on our funds, and have fortified our research team with additional investment analysts, while continuing to foster a collaborative culture across our investment management professionals. We also engage subadvisors who bring additional expertise in specific asset classes, when appropriate.
 Investment Management Products
 Our mutual funds provide a wide variety of investment options. We are the exclusive underwriter and distributor of 83 registered mutual fund portfolios in the Funds, which includes 14 investment styles. During the first quarter of 2018, the remaining Advisors Funds merged into Ivy Funds with substantially similar objectives and strategies. During 2018, six Ivy Funds and one Ivy VIP fund merged into Ivy Funds and an Ivy VIP fund, respectively, with generally similar investment objectives. Variable products, Ivy VIP and InvestEd are offered primarily through Advisors in the broker-dealer channel; in some circumstances, certain of those funds are also offered through the unaffiliated channel. The Ivy Funds are offered through both our unaffiliated channel and broker-dealer channel. The Funds’ AUM are included in either our unaffiliated channel or our broker-dealer channel depending on which channel marketed the client account or is the broker of record. As of December 31, 2018, we had $65.8 billion in AUM.
 Broker-Dealer Products and Services
 Since 1937, W&R has been committed to our client’s financial goals.  W&R offers a variety of sophisticated and personalized financial planning services to address virtually any client goal, objective or situation including retirement planning, education planning, addressing survivor needs, asset allocation, estate planning, business planning, income tax planning, disability and long-term care.  In 2017, W&R introduced a new, industry-leading financial planning platform centered around technology provided by eMoney Advisor.  This platform enables Advisors to better serve their client’s financial planning needs and provides clients with access to their financial plan, important financial planning documents and a holistic view of their entire financial situation all through a convenient wealth management portal.  
 W&R offers clients full-service brokerage services as well as a variety of fee‑based asset allocation programs, including Managed Allocation Portfolio (“MAP”), MAP Choice, MAP Flex, MAPSelect, MAPLatitude and Strategic Portfolio Allocation (“SPA”). These programs utilize a variety of underlying investment options including mutual funds, individual stocks and bonds and exchange traded funds. During 2017, we launched MAPNavigator, an open architecture mutual fund advisory program and enhanced the SPA program, partnering with Wilshire Associates, Inc., an independent consultant, to develop a series of taxable and tax-sensitive investment models consisting of our affiliated Ivy Funds. As of December 31, 2018, clients had $21.2 billion invested in our fee‑based asset allocation programs.
 Through our broker-dealer, we distribute various variable annuity products, some of which offer our affiliated Ivy VIP funds as an investment vehicle. In 2017, IICO enhanced InvestEd by lowering fees and expanding the available investment options. InvestEd offers lower sales charges, reduced minimum initial investment, an increased number of aged-based and static portfolios and individual fund options, along with an expanded range of underlying funds within aged-based and static portfolios. Through our insurance agency subsidiaries, Advisors also offer clients retirement and life insurance products underwritten by our business partners.  We offer unaffiliated mutual fund products, other variable annuity products, and full service brokerage products and services through a third-party clearing broker-dealer. AUA were $51.3 billion at December 31, 2018.

 Distribution Channels
 One of our distinctive qualities is that we distribute our investment products through a balanced distribution network. Our distribution channels cover both retail and institutional unaffiliated sales channels, described below, as well as our affiliated broker-dealer, W&R. Unaffiliated Channel
 In 2018, IDI leadership realigned its distribution model to respond to a changing marketplace and to reinvigorate sales using a more focused approach. The moves centered on two sales channels, National Distribution and Professional Buyers Distribution, in an effort to diversify asset flow and the AUM profile of the Company.
 National Distribution, inclusive of National Accounts and National Wholesale, was enhanced to increase focus and drive fund sales throughout the nationwide broker-dealer network. With the National Accounts team focused on firm home office interactions and the National Wholesale team focused on driving sales at the financial advisor level. This alignment provides a holistic, cohesive and collaborative sales and service approach to our national broker-dealer partners. National Wholesale includes 24 external wholesalers, four of which are exclusively devoted to W&R.
 Professional Buyers Distribution was enhanced to focus on sales and service across the institutional, consultant relations, insurance, registered investment advisor (“RIA”) and defined contribution investment only (“DCIO”) categories. Unifying sales strategies within the Professional Buyers Distribution group brings collaboration, shared knowledge and enhanced service levels to key institutional, retirement, insurance and RIA clients that require specialized interactions and communication.
 The Distribution Operations team supports IDI’s sales and service-related processes including training, business intelligence, client relationship management and sales systems, and practice management. This group also includes IDI’s professional client experience team, which creates key client-facing deliverables utilized by both distribution groups. The Distribution Operations team is designed to help increase the overall knowledge and responsiveness of the entire distribution channel.
 AUM in this channel were $25.0 billion at the end of 2018.
 Broker-Dealer Channel
 Throughout our history, Advisors sold investment products to individuals, families and businesses across the country in geographic markets of all sizes. Advisors assist clients on a wide range of financial issues with a significant focus on helping them plan, generally, for long‑term goals and offer one‑on‑one consultations that emphasize long‑term relationships through continued service. 
 Over the past several years, we have expanded our brokerage platform technology and product offering, while continuing to make investments that allow Advisors to simplify the way they conduct business with clients. We continued to work to transform W&R into a self-sustaining, fully competitive and profitable entity. These efforts include enhancing the compensation program for Advisors, investing in a new advisor technology platform, transitioning advisors currently leasing space in W&R offices to personal branch offices and redesigning services offered to Advisors. These additional enhancements will continue in the future and are designed to increase our ability to retain and competitively recruit experienced Advisors.  
 As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,060 Advisors and 343 licensed advisor associates, for a total of 1,403 individuals associated with W&R who operate out of offices located throughout the United States. We believe, based on industry data, that W&R ranks among the largest independent broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2018, our broker-dealer channel had approximately 380,000 mutual fund clients and AUM of $37.2 billion. Assets under administration (“AUA”) includes both client assets invested in the Funds and in other companies’ products that are distributed through W&R held in brokerage accounts, within our fee-based asset allocation programs, or held directly with the funds.

 Institutional Channel
 We also manage assets in a variety of investment styles for a variety of types of institutions. The largest client type is other asset managers that hire us to act as subadviser for their branded products; they are typically domestic or foreign distributors of investment products who lack scale or the track record to manage internally, or choose to market multi‑manager styles. Our diverse client list includes pension funds, Taft‑Hartley plans and endowments. AUM in the institutional channel were $3.7 billion at December 31, 2018. Service Agreements
 We earn service fee revenues by providing various services to the Funds and their shareholders. Pursuant to shareholder servicing agreements, we perform shareholder servicing functions for which the Funds pay us a monthly fee, including: maintaining shareholder accounts; issuing, transferring and redeeming shares; distributing dividends and paying redemptions; furnishing information related to the Funds; and handling shareholder inquiries. Pursuant to accounting service agreements, we provide the Funds with bookkeeping and accounting services and assistance for which the Funds pay us a monthly fee, including: maintaining the Funds’ records; pricing Fund shares; and preparing prospectuses for existing shareholders, proxy statements and certain other shareholder reports.
 Agreements with the Funds may be adopted or amended with the approval of the disinterested members of each Fund’s board of trustees and have annually renewable terms.
 Competition
 The financial services industry is a highly competitive global industry. According to the Investment Company Institute (the “ICI”), at the end of 2018 there were more than 9,300 open‑end investment companies, more than 500 closed‑end investment companies and more than 1,900 exchange traded funds of varying sizes, investment policies and objectives whose shares are being offered to the public in the United States alone. Factors affecting our business include investment performance, fees, brand recognition, business reputation, quality of service and the continuity of both client relationships and AUM. A majority of mutual fund sales go to funds that are highly rated by a small number of well‑known ranking services that focus on investment performance. Competition is influenced by the achievement of competitive investment management performance, distribution methods, the type and quality of shareholder services, the success of marketing efforts and the ability to develop investment products for certain market segments to meet the changing needs of investors.
 We compete with other mutual fund management, distribution and service companies that distribute their fund shares through a variety of methods, including affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces, broker-dealers and direct sales to the public of shares offered at a low or no sales charge. Many larger mutual fund complexes have significant advertising budgets and established relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks, which enable these fund complexes to reach broad client bases. Many investment management firms and unaffiliated advisors offer services and products similar to ours. We also compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, commercial banks and other financial institutions and businesses offering other financial products in all aspects of their businesses. 
 The distribution of mutual funds and other investment products has experienced significant developments in recent years, which have intensified the competitive environment. These developments include the introduction of new products, the rationalization of the number of products offered on third party platforms, increasingly complex distribution systems with multiple classes of shares, the development of investors’ ability to invest online, the introduction of sophisticated technological platforms used by financial advisors to sell and service mutual funds for their clients, the introduction of separately managed accounts—previously available only to institutional investors—to individuals, and growth in the number of mutual funds offered.  In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive investment strategies, which have taken market share from active managers like ourselves.  While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for active management.
 We believe we effectively compete across multiple dimensions of the asset management and broker-dealer businesses. First, we market our products, primarily the Ivy Funds family, to unaffiliated broker-dealers and advisors and compete against other asset managers offering mutual fund products. Competition is impacted by sales techniques, personal relationships and skills, and the quality of financial planning products and services offered. We compete against a broad range of asset managers that are both larger and smaller than our firm, but we believe that the breadth and depth

of our products position us to compete in this environment. Second, we believe our business model targets clients seeking personal assistance from financial advisors or planners. The market for financial advice is extremely broad and fragmented. Advisors compete with large and small broker-dealers, unaffiliated advisors, registered investment advisers, financial institutions, insurance representatives and others. Finally, we compete in the institutional marketplace, working with consultants who select asset managers for various opportunities, as well as working directly with plan sponsors, foundations, endowments, sovereign funds and other asset managers who hire subadvisors. 
 We also face competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees and Advisors. To maximize our ability to compete effectively in our business, we offer competitive compensation. We are advancing our culture by focusing on our Core Values and further investing in our people through areas such as talent management, employee experiences, diversity & inclusion and total rewards.  For Advisors, we enhanced the compensation program, are investing in a new advisor technology platform and have expanded our brokerage platform technology and product offering.
 For additional discussion regarding the impact of competition, please see the Market and Competition risk factors included in Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
 Regulation
 The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and shareholders of registered investment companies. Under such laws and regulations, agencies and organizations that regulate investment advisers, broker-dealers, and transfer agents like us have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser, broker-dealer or transfer agent from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include, but are not limited to, the suspension of individual employees or agents, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, censures, fines and the revocation of investment adviser and other registrations.
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, which imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including, among other things, fiduciary duties, record‑keeping and reporting requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations, as well as general anti‑fraud prohibitions. Investment advisers are subject to periodic examination by the SEC, and the SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration.
 The Funds are registered as investment companies with the SEC under the ICA, and various filings are made with states under applicable state rules and regulations. The ICA regulates the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser and prohibits or severely restricts principal transactions and joint transactions. Various regulations cover certain investment strategies that may be used by the Funds for hedging and/or speculative purposes. To the extent the Funds purchase futures contracts, options on futures contracts, swaps and foreign currency contracts above certain de minimis thresholds established by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), they are subject to the commodities and futures regulations of the CFTC.
 We derive a large portion of our revenues from investment management agreements. Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements terminate automatically if assigned without the client’s consent. Under the ICA, investment advisory agreements with registered investment companies, such as the Funds, terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments, as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur, under certain circumstances, upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in the Company.
 The Company is also subject to federal and state laws affecting corporate governance, including the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC. Our report on internal controls over financial reporting for 2018 is included in Part I, Item 9A.
 As a publicly traded company, we are also subject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), the exchange on which our stock is listed, including the corporate governance listing standards approved by the SEC.

 Two of our subsidiaries, W&R and IDI, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and the states. Much of the broker-dealer regulation has been delegated by the SEC to self‑regulatory organizations, principally the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), which is the primary regulator of our broker-dealer activities. These self‑regulatory organizations adopt rules (subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the industry and conduct periodic examinations of our operations over which they have jurisdiction. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, the use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure, record‑keeping, and the conduct of directors, officers, employees and associated persons. Violation of applicable regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm, its officers or employees.
 W&R and IDI are each subject to certain net capital requirements pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3‑1 of the Exchange Act (the “Net Capital Rule”) specifies the minimum level of net capital a registered broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that part of its assets be kept in a relatively liquid form. The Net Capital Rule is designed to ensure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Any failure to maintain the required minimum net capital may subject us to suspension or revocation of our registration or other limitations on our activity by the SEC, and suspension or expulsion by FINRA or other regulatory bodies, and ultimately could require the broker-dealer’s liquidation. The maintenance of minimum net capital requirements may also limit our ability to pay dividends. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, net capital for W&R and IDI exceeded all minimum requirements.
 Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, W&R is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”). IDI is exempt from the membership requirements and is not a member of the SIPC. The SIPC provides protection against lost, stolen or missing securities (but not loss in value due to a rise or fall in market prices) for clients in the event of the failure of a broker-dealer. Accounts are protected up to $500,000 per client with a limit of $250,000 for cash balances. However, since the Funds, and not our broker-dealer subsidiaries, maintain client accounts, SIPC protection would not cover mutual fund shareholders whose accounts are maintained directly with the Funds, but would apply to brokerage accounts held on our brokerage platform.
 Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti‑Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, imposes significant anti‑money laundering requirements on all financial institutions, including domestic banks and domestic operations of foreign banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants and investment companies.
 The Company and Advisors in our broker-dealer channel are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent they are considered “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to certain clients.  Although in 2018 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated regulations adopted by the U.S. Department of Labor that, among other things, treated as fiduciaries any person who provides investment advice or recommendations to employee benefit plans, plan fiduciaries, plan participants, plan beneficiaries, IRAs or IRA owners, other regulators have enacted or proposed other fiduciary standards that could require modifications to our distribution activities and may impact our ability to service clients or engage in certain types of distribution or other business activities. 
 Our businesses may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable to us as an investment adviser, broker-dealer or transfer agent, but also by law and regulations of general application. For example, the volume of our principal investment advisory business in a given time period could be affected by, among other things, existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies (including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board), and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities.
 Our business is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations. For additional discussion regarding the impact of current and proposed legal or regulatory requirements, please see the Legal, Regulatory and Tax risk factors included in Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
