     Item 1.    Business 
      General 
        USANA Health Sciences is one of the largest publicly held direct-selling nutrition, personal health and wellness companies in the world. In 2017, we generated $1.047 billion in net sales from more than 565,000 active Customers worldwide. We were founded in 1992 by Myron W. Wentz, Ph.D. and since that time we have developed and manufactured high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products with a primary focus on promoting long-term health and reducing the risk of chronic degenerative disease. In so doing, we are committed to continuous product innovation and sound scientific research. We have operations in 20 markets worldwide, where we distribute and sell our 
 4

   products by way of direct selling. We have chosen the direct selling distribution method as we believe it is the most conducive to meeting our vision as a company, which is improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. Our net sales in fiscal year 2017 were $1.047 billion, of which 88.4% were in markets outside of the United States. As a U.S.-based multi-national company with an expanding international presence, our operating results are sensitive to currency fluctuations, as well as economic and political conditions in markets throughout the world. Additionally, we are subject to the various laws and regulations in the United States, China, and the other markets in which we operate with respect to the products that we sell and to our method of distribution. 
         Our customer base comprises two types of customers: "Associates" and "Preferred Customers" referred to together as "active Customers." Associates share in our company vision by acting as independent distributors of our products in addition to purchasing our products for their personal use. Preferred Customers purchase our products strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products. As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 565,000 active Customers worldwide. For purposes of this report, we only count as active Customers those Associates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period. 
         This portion of our Annual Report on Form 10-K provides detailed information about who we are, what we do and where we are headed. Unless otherwise specified, current information reported in this Form 10-K is as of or for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017. We also discuss the development of our company and the geographic areas where we do business. 
         Throughout this Form 10-K, unless specified otherwise, references to "we," "our," "us" and "the company" refer to the consolidated company. References to "dollars" and "$" are to United States dollars. 
         We meet the information-reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by filing periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports and statementsinformation about our company's business, financial results and other mattersare available at:
 

 the SEC websitewww.sec.gov; 
 the SEC's Public Conference Room, 100 F St. N.E., Washington, D.C., 20549, (800) SEC-0330; and 
 our website (without charge)www.usanahealthsciences.com. 

         When we file the information electronically with the SEC, it also is posted to our website. 
       Current Focus and Recent Developments 
        We have implemented the following strategies and initiatives to increase the number of Associates and Preferred Customers who use our products throughout the world and, thereby, further our company vision: 


 Personalization:  Over the last few years, we have focused heavily on
personalizing and improving our customers' experience with USANA. Personalization will continue to be one of our key strategies as we continue to further personalize each of our product lines. 



In
2017, we introduced Celavive®, our innovative skincare system formulated with the USANA Incelligence Technology®. Celavive® offers a comprehensive skin care
regimen benefiting multiple skin care types and ethnicities, with upgraded science and more noticeable user benefits. We offered limited pre-launch availability of Celavive® in 2017 to
create an opportunity 


 5

   

for
important pre-market user experience and time for our Associates to create Celavive® business plans leading up to 2018. These pre-launches occurred during the third and fourth quarters
of 2017, and successfully created excitement and product demand among our customers. We launched the Celavive® line in select markets in January 2018, and we will continue to
systematically roll it out to more markets around the world throughout 2018. Our 2018 objective is to position Celavive® to generate incremental sales to a new customer demographic for
USANA and grow our skin care line from approximately 6% of net sales to an estimated 10% of net sales by the end of fiscal 2018. Following the launch and roll out of Celavive®, we plan to
phase out our historical Sensé skin care line. 
In
August 2016, we introduced one of the greatest product innovations in our history with the launch of our proprietary InCelligence Technology®. InCelligence is
patent-pending technology that is designed to support the body's natural ability to nourish, protect and renew itself. On our InCelligence platform, we also launched our new flagship
multivitamin, CellSentials. 


 Market-Specific Strategies:  We continued to pursue market-specific
strategies to facilitate growth and strengthen our business around the world. 



During
2017, we offered a variety of product promotions in specific markets around the world, which were successful in generating both (1) additional demand for our products from our existing
customer base; and (2) incremental customer growth in certain markets. We will continue to offer strategically-timed product promotions going forward, along with short-term incentives and
promotions we have offered successfully in the past. 
In
2017, we continued our strategy to increase brand-recognition aimed at making it easier for our Associates to introduce USANA to customers. For example, we renewed our relationship with
Dr. Mehmet Oz as a Trusted Partner and Sponsor of The Dr. Oz Show. Although this partnership is focused on our North America region, it is
intended to increase awareness and recognition of the USANA brand in our other regions as well. Under this partnership, USANA products are regularly featured on The
Dr. Oz Show and viewers of the show are able to purchase USANA products via a direct link on The Dr. Oz Show
website. 
In
2017, we also continued to emphasize our international brand ambassador and athlete sponsorship program known as "Team USANA" with additional athlete sponsorships around the world. Under this
program, USANA is designated as the exclusive supplement provider for over 1,000 elite athletes around the world. These athletes compete at the highest levels of their sport and represent the USANA
brand. 


 Product Innovation, Information Technology and Infrastructure:  In 2017, we
continued our investments in product innovation, information technology and infrastructure to further our company vision, continue to improve our customers' experience with us, and facilitate future
growth as a larger company. These investments led to the successful execution of a number of strategies during 2017, including our Celavive® product launch. In 2018, we will continue to
invest in these areas to drive our initiatives. Our investments in these areas in 2018 will affect our results of operations as additional selling, general and administrative (or "SG&A") expense and
capital expenditures for the year ending December 29, 2018. 



In
2018, we will continue to develop our information technology infrastructure across the enterprise, including the introduction of a new social sharing platform. This platform will allow our
Associates to more fully utilize social media to promote USANA products and interact directly with customers and potential customers. In particular, we are utilizing our social selling platform in
connection with the launch of Celavive® around the world. 


 International Development and Expansion:  Given the significant opportunity
that exists for us in China, we will continue to focus significant time and resources to grow our business in this 

 6

   

market.
We also believe that significant growth opportunities exist in new international markets and our management team will continue to evaluate other markets for USANA's business. 
In
2017 we announced that we will be expanding sales and operations into four additional European countries beginning in mid-2018: Romania, Germany, Italy and Spain. This will increase our global
footprint from 20 to 24 markets. To properly leverage and maximize anticipated growth in these markets, we will use local management supported by our European regional headquarters in Paris, France.
To strategically maximize consumer demand and increase market performance, we have already made products available for purchase to Preferred Customers on a not-for-resale basis in these markets. 
Fiscal
2016 was the first full-year of operations for USANA in Indonesia and we continue to believe that this market offers a promising long-term growth opportunity for us. 


 Preferred Customer Growth Initiatives:  During 2017, we executed several
initiatives to generate customer growth through enhancing our Preferred Customer program. 

During
the first quarter of 2017, we offered a Preferred Customer Invitation Program to our Associates in the United States. Under this plan, we invited active Associates in the United States, who met
certain criteria, to become Preferred Customers. We gather a variety of internal data on our active Associates, including product purchase history, sales volume history, compensation history, and
attendance history at meetings and other events. This and other data strongly suggests that we have a significant population of individuals who initially join USANA as Associates but are interested
only in purchasing and consuming our products. The invitation plan allowed these Associates to reconsider their classification with USANA and elect to become a Preferred Customer. We plan to offer
this invitation to our active Associates in other markets around the world going forward. In 2018, we will continue to enhance our Preferred Customer program through the development of a rewards and
loyalty program exclusive to Preferred Customers. We believe that a strong Preferred Customer Program allows us to (i) further personalize the USANA experience for our customer base,
(ii) enhance overall customer service, and (iii) pursue a growth opportunity that we have not fully realized in the past.

           The approximate percentage of total product sales represented by our top-selling products for the last three fiscal years is as follows: 

   
 | Year Ended | 
Key Product | 2015 | | 2016 | 2017 |

BiOmega-3 | | 12 | % | 13 | % | 14 | %


        Other top-selling products include our HealthPak 100 and CoQuinone ® 30. 
       Geographic Presence 
        Our products are distributed and sold in 20 markets. We have organized our markets into two geographic regions: (i) Asia Pacific, which includes three sub-regions, and (ii) Americas and Europe, as noted below. 
 Asia Pacific 
         Asia Pacific is organized into three sub-regions: Greater China, Southeast Asia Pacific, and North Asia. Markets included in each of these sub-regions are as follows:
 

 Greater ChinaHong Kong, Taiwan, and China. Our business in China is conducted by BabyCare Holdings, Ltd. ("BabyCare"), our
wholly-owned subsidiary. )
 Southeast Asia PacificAustralia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia. We commenced
operations in Indonesia in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 North AsiaJapan and South Korea 

         Asia Pacific has driven our growth the last several years. Our most recent market expansion in this region include our entry into Indonesia in late 2015. Since our acquisition of BabyCare in 2010, our strategy in Asia Pacific has been centered on generating growth in China. Consequently, our growth in Asia Pacific over the last few years has been led by China, and we believe that China will continue to drive our growth in this region going forward. We also expect our business to grow in most of our other markets in this region. 
   Americas and Europe 
         Americas and Europe is our most mature region. Over the last few years, net sales in this region have decreased on a constant currency basis due to customer declines in several markets within the region including the United States. We continue to implement growth strategies in various markets within this region and remain optimistic about our potential to generate growth in this region, specifically within the United States. 
         Because we have operations in multiple markets, with sales and expenses being generated and incurred in multiple currencies, our reported U.S. dollar sales and earnings can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In general, our operating results are affected positively by a weakening the U.S. dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In 2017, net sales outside of the United States represented approximately 88.4% of consolidated net sales.

      Research and Development 
        We focus our research and development (R&D) efforts on developing and bringing to market high-quality, science-based products that promote long-term health and reduce the risk of chronic degenerative disease. Our research and development activities include developing products that are new to USANA and new to the industry, updating existing USANA brand formulas to keep them current with the latest science, and adapting existing formulas to meet ever-changing regulations in new and existing international markets. The R&D team is also involved in protecting our proprietary position with both exclusive ingredients and patent protection. We filed three new U.S. patent applications on our InCelligence platform and CellSentials formulation in 2016. Additional research support for this technology is underway. In addition, we continue to pursue an ongoing clinical study to further quantify the health benefits of our USANA CellSentials featuring our proprietary InCelligence, cell signaling technology, which was launched in August 2016. Our scientific staff includes experts on human nutrition, cellular biology, biochemistry, genetics, the microbiome, natural product chemistry, and clinical research. These experts continually review the latest published research on nutrition, attend scientific conferences, and work with a number of third-party research institutions and researchers to identify possible new products and opportunities and reformulate our existing products. 
         Our in-house research team has built relationships with scientists at a number of universities and top research institutes, including the University of Washington, the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, the University of Utah, The Foods for Health Institute at The University of California, Davis, and The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, to maintain our leadership in clinical research in nutrition, oxidative stress, glycemic stress, chronic inflammation and health implications of the microbiome. 
         We follow pharmaceutical standards established by the U.S. Pharmacopeia and other pharmacopeias in the development and formulation of our products. Our ingredients are selected to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to: safety, potency, purity, stability, bio-availability, and efficacy. We control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage, and we maintain our quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling. In fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, we expended $6.4 million, $8.8 million, and $9.0 million, respectively, on product research and development activities. Going forward, we expect to increase our spending and resources for research and development in connection with our personalization and product innovation strategies.

         Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
        We conduct manufacturing, production and quality control operations for roughly two-thirds of our nutritional products in-house. We have established and maintain a manufacturing and quality control facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. BabyCare manufactures and produces nearly all of its products in-house and maintains manufacturing and quality control facilities in Beijing, China and Tianjin, China. This section of this report gives you more information about our manufacturing, production and quality control operations. 
 Tablet Manufacturing 
         Our tablet production process uses automatic and semi-automatic equipment and includes the following activities:
 

 auditing and qualifying suppliers of raw materials; 
 acquiring raw materials; 
 analyzing raw material quality; 
 weighing or otherwise measuring raw materials; 
 mixing raw materials into batches; 
 forming mixtures into tablets; 
 coating and sorting the tablets; 
 analyzing tablet quality; 
 packaging finished products; and 
 analyzing finished product quality. 

         We conduct sample testing of raw materials, in-process materials, and finished products for purity, potency, and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications, and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests. We employ a qualified staff of professionals to develop, implement and maintain a quality system designed to assure that our products are manufactured to our internal and applicable regulatory agency specifications. 
         Our Salt Lake City manufacturing facility is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), Health Canada Natural Health Products Directorate, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration ("TGA"), and other governmental agencies, as required. This facility is audited regularly by these and other various organizations and government agencies to assess, among other things, compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMPs") and with labeling claims. Additionally, our Salt Lake City manufacturing facility is certified, through inspection and audits, with the Islamic Foods and Nutrition Counsel of America in compliance with Halal, The Organized Kashrus Laboratories in compliance with Kosher, NSF International in compliance with product testing and GMPs, and the TGA in compliance with the current Therapeutic Goods Act in Australia. 
         The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs and pharmaceutical GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We are audited by the FDA, specifically for dietary supplements, and have been found in full compliance with GMPs for dietary supplements. 
         Our Beijing, China manufacturing facility is registered with the China Food and Drug Administration ("CFDA"), and other governmental agencies, as required. This facility is audited 
 11

   regularly by various organizations and government agencies to assess, among other things, compliance with applicable GMPs, and with labeling claims. 
   Personal Care Manufacturing 
         The production process for personal care products includes identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials, acquiring raw materials, analyzing raw material quality, weighing or otherwise measuring the raw materials, mixing raw materials into batches, analyzing liquid batch quality, packaging finished products, and analyzing finished product quality. We conduct sample testing of raw materials, in-process materials, and finished products for purity, potency, and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications, and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests. 
         At our Salt Lake City facility, we have standard technology for producing batches of personal care items, and we have semi-automatic packaging equipment for packaging end products. We employ qualified staff to develop, implement, and maintain a quality system. Although the FDA has not promulgated GMPs for personal care items, it has issued guidelines for manufacturing personal care products. We voluntarily maintain compliance with the guidance established by the FDA and the Personal Care Products Council. 
   Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers 
         We contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of some of our products, which account for approximately 33% of our product sales. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package these products according to formulations that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in-house product development team. These products include most of our gelatin-capsulated supplements, Rev3 Energy Drink, Probiotic, our powdered drink mixes, and certain of our personal care products including our new Celavive® line. Products manufactured by third-party suppliers at their locations must also pass through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are manufactured in conformance with our specifications. 
   Quality Control/Assurance 
         We have microbiology and analytical chemistry labs in which we conduct quality control processes. In our microbiology laboratory, scientists test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods. In our analytical chemistry laboratory, scientists test for chemical contamination and accurate levels of active ingredients in both raw materials and finished products. Scientists also identify and confirm all raw materials used in the manufacturing process through scientifically valid means. Both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine the shelf life of our products. Our Salt Lake City laboratory staff also performs chemical assays on vitamin and mineral constituents, using U.S. Pharmacopoeia methods and other internally validated methods. In addition to our quality control and clinical laboratories, our headquarters and China facilities also house a laboratory designated for research and development. 
   Raw Materials 
         Most of the raw ingredients that are used in the manufacture of our products are available from a number of suppliers. We have not generally experienced difficulty in obtaining necessary quantities of raw ingredients. When supplies of certain raw materials have tightened, we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials, and believe we will be able to do so in the future, if the need arises. Our raw material suppliers must demonstrate stringent process and quality control before we use their products in our manufacturing process. 
 12

         Distribution and Marketing 
  General 
         We distribute our products internationally through a network marketing system, which is a form of person-to-person direct selling. Under this system, distributors purchase products at wholesale prices from the manufacturer for resale to consumers and for personal consumption. The concept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends, neighbors, relatives, and close acquaintances. We believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person-to-person product education and testimonials, as well as higher levels of customer service, all of which are not as readily available through other distribution channels. 
 Structure of Network Marketing Program 
  Associates.    A person who wishes to sell USANA products must join our independent sales force as an Associate. A person becomes an Associate by completing an application under the sponsorship of an existing Associate. The new Associate then becomes part of the sponsoring Associate's sales organization. New Associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to the USANA policies and procedures. Under the policies and procedures, Associates may not, among other things: (i) use deceptive or unlawful practices to sell USANA products; (ii) make deceptive or unlawful claims or representations concerning our products or Compensation Plan; or (iii) sell competitive products to other USANA Associates or solicit USANA Associates to participate in other network marketing opportunities. Associates who violate these policies are subject to discipline, including potential termination of their purchase and distribution rights. New Associates are required to purchase a starter kit that includes a detailed manual describing our business and products, as well as our policies and procedures. We sell these kits at a nominal price averaging $30 in each of our markets. No other investment is required to become an Associate. 
         Once a person becomes an Associate, she or he may purchase products directly from us at wholesale prices for personal use and resale to customers. Our Associates are also entitled to build sales organizations by attracting and enrolling new Associates and establishing a network of product users. Associates are not required to recruit or sponsor new Associates and we do not compensate Associates for sponsoring or recruiting Associates. The sponsoring of new Associates results in the creation of multiple levels within our network marketing structure. Sponsored Associates are referred to as part of the sales organization of the sponsoring Associate. New Associates may also sponsor new Associates, creating additional levels in their network, but also forming a part of the same sales organization as the original sponsoring Associate. As outlined below, Associates who are interested in earning additional income must successfully sell USANA products and establish a business network in order to qualify for commissions, including bonuses. Subject to payment of a minimal annual account renewal fee, Associates may continue to distribute or consume our products as long as they adhere to our policies and procedures. 
         Individuals who reside in China and who are interested in being part of USANA's organization in China may do so by joining BabyCare. While the process for joining BabyCare is similar to the process for joining USANA, individuals who join BabyCare must initially join as a China Preferred Customer, or CPC. CPCs are similar to Preferred Customers in our other markets, but CPCs also have the right in China to refer other CPCs and receive rebates on future product purchases based on the volume of product purchased by CPCs they have referred. A CPC may become a direct seller or independent distributor (collectively referred to as Associates) in China by electing to do so, signing an Associate agreement, and agreeing to adhere to BabyCare's policies and procedures in China. Much like our operations in other markets, an Associate in China may build a sales organization and receive 
 13

   compensation for product sales in China. Associates in China are compensated under a compensation plan created and implemented by BabyCare specifically for China. 
  Preferred Customers.    We also sell directly to customers who purchase products only for personal use. This program is our "Preferred Customer" program. Preferred Customers may not resell or distribute our products. We believe this program gives us access to a customer market that would otherwise be missed, by targeting consumers who enjoy USANA products, but who prefer not to maintain a distribution relationship with us. Although our policies prohibit Preferred Customers from engaging in retail sales of products, they may enroll as Associates at any time in the future, if they desire. Preferred Customers are not eligible to earn commissions or to participate in our Compensation Plan while they are Preferred Customers. As noted above, our China operations utilize a CPC program, which is based on USANA's Global Preferred Customer program in our other markets with modifications that we have made specifically for our China market. Historically, we have reported CPCs as Associates because of certain attributes associated with the CPC program. However, starting in 2017, we began reporting CPCs as Preferred Customers. 
   Associate Training and Motivation 
         Initial training of Associates about USANA, our products and Compensation Plan, and how to use network marketing, is provided primarily by an Associate's sponsor and others in the Associate's sales organization. We develop and sell training materials and sales tools to assist Associates in building their businesses, and we provide reprints from commercial publications that feature USANA that may be used as sales tools. We also sponsor and conduct regional, national, and international Associate events, as well as intensive leadership training seminars. Attendance at these sessions is voluntary, and we undertake no generalized effort to provide individualized training to Associates, although experience shows that the most effective and successful Associates tend to be those who participate in such training activities. Although we provide leadership training and sales tools, we ultimately rely on our Associates to sell our products, attract new Associates and Preferred Customers to purchase our products, and to educate and train new Associates regarding our products and Compensation Plan. 
 Associate Compensation 
         This section describes our Compensation Plan generally. As noted elsewhere in this report, however, our China operations maintain their own compensation plan, which has been implemented by BabyCare specifically for China. 
         Our Compensation Plan provides several opportunities for Associates to earn compensation, provided they are willing to consistently work at building, training, and retaining their sales organizations to sell USANA products to consumers. The purpose behind each form of compensation under our Compensation Plan is to reward committed Associates for generating product sales either directly or indirectly through their sales organization and network of product consumers. 
         Associates can earn compensation in four ways: 
 

 Commissions.  The primary way an Associate is compensated is through earning
commissions. Associates earn commissions by generating sales volume points, which are a unit of measure of the product sales of their sales organization. Each of our products is assigned a sales
volume point value comprised of a certain percentage of the product price in U.S. dollars. To be eligible to earn commissions, an Associate must sell a certain amount of product each month
("Qualifying Sales"). Qualifying Sales may include products that the Associates either use personally or that they resell to consumers. Associates do not earn commissions on their personal Qualifying
Sales. Associates may earn commissions on their sale of products above the Qualifying Sales as well as the sale of products by Associates in their organization and to Preferred Customers.
Additionally, Associates do not earn commissions for simply recruiting and 

 14

   

enrolling
others in their organization. Commissions are paid only on the sale of products. In most markets, we pay Associates their commissions on a weekly basis. 


 Bonuses.  We offer Associates several bonus opportunities, including our
leadership bonus, elite bonus, and lifetime matching bonus. These bonus opportunities are based on a pay-for-performance philosophy and, therefore, are paid out when the Associate achieves certain
performance measures. 
 Retail Mark-Ups.  As discussed previously, in markets where retail mark-ups
are permitted, our Associates purchase products from us at the Preferred Price and may resell them to consumers at higher retail prices. This allows the Associate to retain the retail mark-up as
another form of compensation. 
 Contests and Promotions.  We regularly sponsor contests and promotions
designed to incentivize Associates to generate sales, grow their sales organization, and increase the number of product users. These promotions are also based on a pay-for-performance philosophy and,
therefore, are only paid upon the achievement of certain objectives. 

         We endeavor to integrate our Compensation Plan seamlessly across all markets where legally permissible, allowing Associates to receive commissions for globalnot merely localproduct sales. This seamless sales organization structure is designed to allow Associates to build a global network by establishing or expanding their sales organization in any of the markets where we operate. We believe our Compensation Plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally, and we intend to continue to integrate new markets, where permitted, into our Compensation Plan. 
       Operating Strengths 
        Our principal objective is to improve the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. We do this through (i) developing and manufacturing high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products that promote long-term health, (ii) personalizing our products to our customers' needs and desires; and (iii) providing an opportunity through network marketing for our Associates who desire to distribute our products and earn supplemental income. Our strategy is to capitalize on our operating strengths, which include: a strong research and development program; significant in-house manufacturing capability; high quality science-based products; an equitable Associate Compensation Plan; a scalable business model; and an experienced management team. 
  Emphasis on Research and Development.    We have a technical team of experienced scientists, including several holding Ph.D. degrees, quality engineers, and regulatory specialists who contribute to our research and development activities. In our research and development laboratories, our scientists and researchers:


 Investigate activities of natural extracts and formulated products in laboratory and clinical settings; 
 Identify and research combinations of nutrients that may be candidates for new products; 
 Develop new nutritional ingredients for use in supplements; 
 Study the metabolic activities of existing and newly identified nutritional ingredients; 
 Enhance existing USANA brand products, as new discoveries in nutrition and skin care are made; 
 Formulate products to meet diverse regulatory requirements across all of our markets; and 
 Investigate processes for improving the production of our formulated products. 

 15

           Our scientists and researchers also conduct double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies, which are intended to further evaluate the efficacy of our products. In addition, we collaborate with outside research organizations to further support various aspects of our research and development efforts. Our in-house research team works closely with scientists at a number of universities and top research institutes, including those listed under the caption "Research and Development" above, to maintain our leadership in clinical research in nutrition, oxidative stress, glycemic stress, chronic inflammation and health implications of the micro-biome. We have also funded clinical research programs at Boston University, the University of Colorado, the University of Utah, the University of Sydney in Australia, The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital (or "TOSH"), and Utah State University. Our R&D team also works closely with the Medical staff at Sanoviv Medical Institute in Rosarito, Mexico to obtain additional perspectives on the use of supplements in a clinical setting and to get feedback on formulas in development. Additionally, our Scientific Advisory Council, comprised of health care professionals and nutritional science experts worldwide, provides us with valuable insights into product applications and efficacy. It is through our internal research and development efforts, as well as our relationships with outside research organizations and health care providers, that we can provide what we believe to be some of the highest quality health products in the industry. 
  In-house Manufacturing.    We manufacture products that account for approximately 67% of our product sales. We believe that our ability to manufacture our own products in-house is a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons:
 

 We can better control the quality of raw materials and finished products; 
 We can more reliably monitor the manufacturing process to better guarantee potency and bioavailability and to reduce the risk of product
contamination; 
 We can better control production schedules to increase the likelihood of maintaining an uninterrupted supply of products for our customers; 
 We are able to produce most of our own prototypes in the research phase of product development; and 
 We are better able to manage the underlying costs associated with manufacturing our products. 

  Science-based Quality Products.    As a result of our emphasis on research and development and our in-house manufacturing capabilities, we have developed a line of high-quality health products that we believe provides health benefits to our customers. Our products have been developed based on a combination of published research, in-house laboratory and third-party clinical studies, and sponsored research. 
         Equitable Associate Compensation Plan and Support.    We are committed to increasing our product sales by providing a competitive compensation plan that attracts and retains Associates who constitute our sales force. We motivate our Associates by paying incentives on a weekly basis. Additionally, our Compensation Plan is, where permissible, a global-seamless plan, meaning that Associates can be compensated each week for their business success in any market in which they have a sales organization where we conduct business. As noted elsewhere in this report, our China operations maintain their own compensation plan, which is structured differently than USANA's plan in other markets. 
         To support our Associates, we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year, where we offer information about our products and our network marketing system. These meetings are designed to assist Associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with some of our Associate leaders and with members of the USANA management team. We also provide low-cost sales tools and resources, which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home-based business for our Associates. For example, we offer a computer-based, interactive 
 16

   presentation tool, called Health and Freedom Solution, which is designed to help our Associates easily explain and share the USANA opportunity, including the benefits of our products and our Compensation Plan. 
         In addition to company-sponsored meetings, sales tools and resources, we maintain a website exclusively for our Associates, where they can access the latest USANA news, obtain training materials, manage their personal information, enroll new customers, shop for products, and register for company-sponsored events. Additionally, through this website, Associates can access other online services to which they may subscribe. For example, we offer an online business management service, which includes a tool that helps Associates track and manage their business activity, a personal webpage to which prospects or retail customers can be directed, and e-cards for advertising. 
         We also believe that recognition is an important factor in supporting and retaining our Associates. We understand that being a successful USANA Associate requires hard work and dedication, and we celebrate key achievements and rank advancements of our Associates. We believe that our recognition programs greatly contribute to our ability to retain our Associates. 
         Business Model.    We believe that our business model provides, among others, the following advantages:
 

 No requirement for a company-employed sales force to sell our products, with a relatively low incremental cost to add a new Associate; 
 Commissions paid to our Associates are tied to sales performance; 
 Accounts receivable are minimal because payment is required at the time an Associate or Preferred Customer purchases product; 
 A stream of recurring revenue from our monthly product subscription program known as "Auto Order," which we utilize in all of our markets (for
the year ended December 30, 2017, this program represented 56% of our product sales volume); and 
 We can typically expand into new international markets with moderate investment because we generally maintain only warehouse facilities,
customer support, and minimal administrative facilities in those international markets. Larger markets, including China however, require more significant local investment. 

  Experienced Management Team.    Our management team includes individuals with expertise in various scientific and managerial disciplines, including nutrition, product research and development, international development, marketing, customer network development, information technology, manufacturing, finance, legal, regulatory, and operations. This team is responsible for supporting growth, research and development, international expansion, strengthening our financial condition, and improving our internal controls. 
       Growth Strategy 
        We seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies: 
  Attract and Retain Customers.    Our active Customers are central to the growth and success of our business. Accordingly, our primary growth strategy focuses on increasing our overall active Customer counts throughout the world, with an emphasis on growing our Preferred Customer business. In that regard, our efforts to enhance our Preferred Customer business described under the "Current Focus and Recent Developments" section above is central to our overall customer growth strategy. We will execute this strategy by applying both world-wide and region-specific initiatives, which include the initiatives set out below. Our management team maintains a close working relationship with our Associate leaders by interacting with them on a regular basis through in-person meetings and phone 
 17

   calls. Further, in addition to our Annual International Convention and our Asia Pacific Convention, we hold several regional events in key growth areas to provide support and training to Associates. We continue to invest in these events and in the marketing of our business to help Associates improve the productivity of their businesses. 
  Personalization.    Our personalization initiative has been a key marketing and operating strategy for us over the last few years and will continue to be a key strategy going forward. This initiative focuses on personalizing and improving our overall business, as well as our customers' experience with USANA. We have already applied personalization to many aspects of our business and have several additional enhancements planned going forward, all of which is further discussed above under "Current Focus and Recent Developments." 
  New Product Introductions.    Our research and development team continually reviews the latest scientific findings related to nutrition, conducts or manages research and clinical trials, reviews new technologies, and attends scientific conferences. If, in that process, we see potential for a new product or ingredient that provides a measurable and important health benefit, and we believe this benefit can be realized by a significant number of our customers, we will generally pursue development of that product. Our research and development focus has been and will continue to be centered on personalization and innovation. To the extent reasonably possible, we intend to personalize our product offering and product delivery systems to our customers' individual needs. At our 2017 International Convention, we introduced our Celavive® product line, which is formulated with our USANA InCelligence Technology®. We began launching Celavive® in select markets in January 2018, and will systematically roll it out to other markets around the world throughout 2018. 
  Successfully Grow each of our Regions through Market Specific Strategies and Incentives.    In light of the strength of our Asia Pacific region and our growing Associate base in Asia, we believe that Greater China continues to be the most significant and imminent growth opportunity for us. Our strategy in this region is focused on generating customer growth in each market, with an emphasis on China. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, BabyCare, is our operating entity in China. BabyCare has been granted licenses to engage in direct selling in four municipalities/provinces: Beijing, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Tianjin. Additionally, in 2016 BabyCare received preliminary approval from the China government to expand its direct selling business into the following eight additional provinces and/or municipalities: Liaoning Province, Shandong Province, Shanxi Province, Sichuan Province, Guangdong Province, Dalian City, Qingdao City, and Shenzhen City. The eight preliminary approvals granted to BabyCare in 2016 require BabyCare to complete certain conditions and reporting requirements before the final direct selling approvals will be issued. BabyCare is in the process of completing these conditions and reporting requirements. Due to the nature of this process, and the discretion maintained by the Chinese government, there is no guarantee that the Chinese government will ultimately grant BabyCare a direct sales license in each area where BabyCare has received a preliminary approval. In 2016, we successfully completed and transitioned manufacturing operations to our new manufacturing facility in Beijing. This facility now houses manufacturing for most of the product sold in China by BabyCare. We have also spent the last few years adding strength and expertise to our management team in China, improving our information systems, technology and infrastructure in China, educating our customers on our product offering and business model in China, and registering additional products for sale by BabyCare in China. We will continue to execute these strategies going forward. 
         We are also confident in our growth potential in our Southeast Asia Pacific region. While the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand have been key growth markets for us historically, we believe we can generate sales and customer growth in other markets within this region. We have implemented strategies for each market in this region, which are intended to drive customer growth in 2018. 
         Our Americas and Europe region is also very important to our business and a significant part of our growth strategy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our sales results in the Americas and Europe 
 18

   region declined in 2017 due to declines in the number of active Customers in each market within the region during the year. In particular, our 2017 sales and customer results in the United States, Canada and Mexico did not meet our expectations. Our objective for this region remains centered on increasing the overall number of customers who consistently use USANA products. To achieve our objective, we plan to execute a number of strategies in this region in 2018, including strategies centered on (i) our new Celavive® product line, (ii) social sharing and selling, (iii) personalization, and (iv) our Preferred Customer initiative. We will also continue to utilize market-specific promotions and incentives in this region. 
  Brand Awareness:    To facilitate customer growth, we plan to continue to promote global awareness of the USANA brand through various strategies, including professional athlete sponsorships and credible associations with individuals and organizations. Examples of this include our sponsorship of the U.S. Ski Team, Speed Skating Canada, and US Speedskating, our partnership with the Women's Tennis Association, and our support of AFC Bournemouth of England's Premier League. We continue to serve as the official health supplement supplier for these teams and organizations and are also increasing our sponsorship of individual athletes who rely on our products and brand. We seek to leverage these relationships to build brand credibility and increase product consumption and loyalty. In addition to our athlete sponsorships, we seek to advertise and collaborate with credible, nationally recognized organizations and individuals to enhance our global brand. In 2017, for example, we renewed our relationship with Dr. Mehmet Oz as a Trusted Partner and Sponsor of The Dr. Oz Show. While branding efforts such as this have a global reach, the primary objective of this initiative is to grow sales and customers in the Americas and Europe. 
         Enter New Markets.    We believe that significant growth opportunities continue to exist in markets where we currently conduct business and in new international markets. We will open four new European countries beginning in mid-2018. These new markets, Romania, Germany, Italy and Spain, will increase our global footprint from 20 to 24 markets worldwide. We select new markets like these following an assessment of several factors, including market size, anticipated demand for USANA products, receptiveness to network marketing, and the market entry process, which includes consideration of possible regulatory restrictions on our products or our network marketing system. We have also begun to register certain products with regulatory and government agencies in other countries in preparation for further international expansion. Wherever possible, we expect to seamlessly integrate the Compensation Plan in each market to allow Associates to receive commissions for globalnot merely localproduct sales. This seamless sales structure is designed to allow an Associate to build a global network by creating a sales organization across national borders. We believe our seamless Compensation Plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally, and we intend, where permitted, to integrate future markets into this Compensation Plan. While we deem new market expansion as a key growth strategy, given the significant opportunity that currently exists in China, we plan to continue to focus the majority of our time and resources on growing that market. 
         Pursue Strategic Acquisitions.    We believe that attractive acquisition opportunities may arise in the future. We intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that would grow our customer base, expand our product lines, enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise, allow vertical integration, or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals. 
       Competition 
        Our industry is very competitive and the barriers to entry are not significant. We compete with manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of nutritional products in many channels, including direct sales, specialty retail stores, wholesale stores, and the internet generally. We also compete with other public and privately owned direct sellers for distributor talent, including for example Amway, Herbalife, and Nu Skin. On both fronts, some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have a 
 19

   longer operating history, higher visibility and name recognition, and greater financial resources than we do. We compete with these entities by emphasizing the strengths of our business, as described in the "Operating Strengths" section above, to our Associates, Preferred Customers and potential customers. 
       Product Returns 
        Product returns have not been a material factor in our business, totaling approximately 0.6%, 0.7%, and 0.7% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Customer satisfaction has always been and will continue to be a hallmark of our business. We believe that we have always offered a generous product return policy. Our standard return policy allows Associates and Preferred Customers to receive a 100% refund on the sales price of any unused and resalable products that are returned up to one year from the date of purchase. This standard policy differs slightly in a few of our international markets due to the regulatory environment in those markets. To avoid manipulation of our Compensation Plan, return of product where the purchase amount exceeds $100 and was not damaged at the time of receipt by the Associate may result in cancellation of an Associate's distributorship. 
       Major Customers 
        Sales are made to independent Associates and Preferred Customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the nature of our business model results in a significant amount of sales to several different Associate leaders and their sales organizations. Although no single Associate accounted for 10% or more of our net sales, the loss of a key Associate leader or that Associate's sales organization could adversely affect our net sales and our overall operating results. 
       Associate Compliance 
        Our reputation depends upon the quality of our products and the integrity of our Associates. We continually monitor and review our Associates' compliance with our policies and procedures as well as the laws and regulations applicable to our business around the world. Part of this review entails an assessment of our Associates' sales activities to ensure that they are actually selling products to consumers. Our policies and procedures require Associates to present our products and the USANA opportunity ethically and honestly. Associates are not permitted to make claims about our products or Compensation Plan that are not consistent with our policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations. The majority of our Associates must use marketing and promotional materials provided by USANA. Associates who have achieved a certain leadership level are permitted, however, to produce their own marketing and promotional materials, but only if such materials are approved by us prior to their use. 
         From time to time, we have Associates who fail to adhere to our policies and procedures. We systematically review reports of alleged Associate misbehavior. Infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to our compliance group, who determine what disciplinary action is warranted in each case. More serious infractions are reported to our Compliance Committee, which includes USANA executives. If we determine that an Associate has violated any of our policies and procedures, we may take a number of disciplinary actions, such as warnings, fines or probation. We may also withdraw or deny awards, suspend privileges, withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied, or take other appropriate actions in our discretion, including termination of the Associate's purchase and distribution rights. 
         Because we believe that Associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business, we are aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. When an Associate fails to comply with our policies and procedures, we may terminate the Associate's purchase and distribution rights. From time to time, we become involved in litigation with Associates whose purchase 
 20

   and distribution rights have been terminated. We consider such litigation to be routine and incidental to our business and we will continue to be aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. 
       Information Technology 
        We believe that the ability to efficiently manage distribution, compensation, manufacturing, inventory, and communication functions through the use of secure, sophisticated, and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success. We continually evaluate changes in the information technology environment to ensure that we are capitalizing on new technologies, keeping pace with regulatory standards, and ensuring that our systems and data are secure. Over the last several years we have meaningfully invested in technology systems and infrastructure to create a better overall customer experience for our customers. 
         Our information technology resources are maintained primarily by our in-house staff to optimally support our customer base and core business processes. Our IT staff manages an array of systems and processes which support our global operations 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Three of our most critical applications include:
 

 A web-based application that provides online services to Associates, such as training sessions and presentations, online shopping, enrollment,
a real-time reporting engine, Company and product information, web-hosting, email, and other tools to help Associates effectively manage their business and sales organizations. 
 A web-based order-entry system that handles order entry, customer information, compensation, Associate business structure, returns, invoices,
and other transactional-based processes. 
 A fully integrated world-wide Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system that handles accounting, human resources, inventory management,
production processes, quality assurance, and reporting requirements in a multinational environment. 

         Our web applications are supported by a clustered environment providing high availability. All production systems are fully backed-up and stored off-site to mitigate the risk of significant interruption of our business in the event of a disaster at the locations of our primary servers. 
       Regulatory Matters 
 General.    In every jurisdiction in which we operate, our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. These regulations exist at various national and local levels and pertain to our products, network marketing program, and other aspects of our business. In this section, we describe the regulations that are applicable to our business. 
         Product Regulation.    Numerous governmental agencies regulate the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, promoting, importing, distributing, and the selling of health supplements, cosmetics, and foods. In the United States, advertisement of our products is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") under the FTC Act and, where such advertising is considered to be product labeling, by the FDA, under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and related regulations. Our products and related manufacturing and packaging activities are also subject to regulation in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 21



        Our largest selling product group includes products that are regulated as dietary supplements under the FDCA. Dietary supplements are also regulated in the United States under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA"), which we believe is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. Some of our powdered drink, food bar, and other nutrition products are regulated as foods under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 ("NLEA"). The NLEA establishes requirements for ingredient and nutritional labeling including product labeling claims. The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs and Pharmaceutical GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We are audited annually by the FDA, specifically for dietary supplements and have been found in full compliance with GMPs for dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement & Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over-the-counter products to notify the FDA when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the United States. We have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years, and we believe that we are in compliance with this law. 
         In general, our personal care products, which are regulated as cosmetic products by the FDA, are not subject to pre-market approval by that agency. Cosmetics, however, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the FDCA. Cosmetics also are subject to specific labeling regulations, including warning statements, if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately substantiated or if the product may be hazardous, as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug, such as sunscreens, are regulated as drugs. Over-the-counter ("OTC") drug products, including cosmetics, may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of the OTC monograph that is applicable to that drug. Drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved New Drug Application ("NDA") before marketing may begin. Under these provisions, if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our OTC drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our OTC drug products, we would be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved NDA or until the time, if ever, that the monograph is amended to include such product. 
         Advertising of our products in the United States is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Under the FTC's Substantiation Doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a "reasonable basis" for all objective product claims before the claims are made. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States. In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplement, weight-management, and cosmetic products. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. We believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States, and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines. However, no assurance can be given that the FTC would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the United States. 
         The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although, to our knowledge, we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no 
 22

   assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States. 
         The manufacturing, labeling, and advertising of our products are also regulated by various governmental agencies outside the United States in each country where they are distributed. In Australia, product registration, labeling and manufacturing is regulated by the TGA. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare regulates these activities. In China, the China Food and Drug Administration ("CFDA") regulates product registration, labeling and manufacturing. Upon entering a new market, prior to commencing operations or marketing products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from that country's Food Administration, Ministry of Health or comparable agency. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of USANA products for the particular market or approval or licensing otherwise may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients in a given market. 
         We must also comply with local product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. For example, China extensively regulates the registration, labeling and marketing of our products. In China, our nutritional products are typically classified as "health functional foods" and our personal care products are typically classified as "non-special use cosmetics." The registration process for health functional foods is complex and generally requires extensive analysis and approval by the CFDA. As a result, it can take several years to register a product as a health functional food in China. While all products currently sold by BabyCare in China have been registered with the CFDA, we continue to work through the registration process for other health functional food products, which we also hope to begin selling through BabyCare in the future. 
         We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
  Network Marketing Regulation.    Various laws and regulations in all of our markets regulate network marketing, or direct selling. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, including statutes, rules, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative orders. Generally, the regulations are directed at: (i) ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within a sales organization is based on product sales rather than on investments in the organization or on other criteria that are not related to sales; and (ii) preventing the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling and network marketing activities. Network marketing regulations are inherently fact-based and often do not include "bright line" rules. In most of our markets, these regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and respective legal authority. Consequently, the regulations, or a regulator's interpretation and enforcement of the regulations, could change at any time. If that were to occur, we may be required to change our business model in the respective market in an effort to comply. 
         In the United States, the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate direct selling or network marketing companies under the FTC Act. The FTC's interpretation of the applicable direct selling laws and regulations has evolved over the last several years as represented in various consent decrees between the FTC and certain direct selling companies relating to a variety of consumer protection issues, including misleading earnings representations by a company's independent distributors, as well as the 
 23

   fairness and legal validity of a company's business model and distributor compensation plan. For instance, in July 2016, the FTC entered into a consent decree with a direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC had alleged that, among other things, the direct selling company's distributors were making misleading representations regarding income and that the company was utilizing an unfair and deceptive compensation plan. Additionally, in September 2016, the FTC entered into a consent decree with another direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC had alleged that the company's distributors were making misleading earnings representations and that the company was utilizing an illegal business model. In each of these settlements, the FTC required the company to pay a significant fine, revise its U.S. business model and compensation plan to comply with various restrictions on how it can compensate independent distributors and to make changes to its marketing practices to avoid misleading income representations. FTC determinations such as these have created ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and regulations applicable to direct selling companies in the U.S. Although these settlements do not represent judicial precedent or have the force of law or a new rule or regulation, FTC officials have indicated that the direct selling industry should look to the principles underlying these consent decrees for guidance in their own businesses. Additionally, several months after these settlements were entered into, the FTC issued non-binding guidance to the direct selling industry, which reinforces many of the principles contained in the consent decrees and provides other operational guidance to direct selling companies. We have analyzed the consent decrees and guidance issued by the FTC and are in the process of both (i) refining aspects of our U.S. business model based on the principles contained in these documents, and (ii) conducting additional analysis to determine if further changes to our model may be necessary. Based on our interpretation and understanding of these principles, we believe that we can demonstrate compliance with the principles contained in the consent decrees and guidance. No assurance can be given; however, that the FTC, if it were to review our U.S. business, would agree with our assessment and not require us to change one or more aspects of our operations in the U.S. in the future. Any action against us in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our operations in the U.S. 
         A significant amount of our business is generated in China. The direct selling industry in China continues to evolve and mature. Consequently, the regulatory environment for our industry is also still developing and maturing in China. The Chinese government has adopted direct selling laws and regulations that are uncertain and evolving. These regulations contain a number of financial and operational restrictions on direct selling companies, most notably on pyramid selling and multi-level compensation. These regulations are also subject to discretionary interpretation and enforcement by various municipal, provincial and state officials in China. We detail more of the various risks associated with our business in this report in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." 
         Our business in China is that of BabyCare. BabyCare's business model has been designed specifically for China based on a variety of factors, including: (i) BabyCare's communications with the Chinese government, (ii) BabyCare's interpretation of the direct selling laws and regulations, as well as their understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) BabyCare's understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China. While BabyCare has not received formal confirmation from the Chinese government that its business model in China complies with applicable direct selling regulations, we believe that, based on the information and qualifications noted above in this paragraph, BabyCare's model in China is compliant with such regulations, as those regulations are currently interpreted and enforced by the Chinese government. 
         Network marketing companies, and the direct selling industry in general, continue to experience significant media and public scrutiny in many countries. Several companies similar to ours recently have been scrutinized and penalized in several markets where we operate, including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. This scrutiny, along with the uncertainty of the laws and regulations pertaining to network marketing in many countries, can affect how a regulator or member 
 24

   of the public perceives us. For instance, there has been significant media and short-seller attention given to the viability and legality of network marketing in the United States and China over the past few years. This attention has led to intense public scrutiny of our industry, as well as volatility in our stock price and the stock prices of other direct selling companies who operate in the same markets. We cannot predict the impact that this scrutiny may have on our business or industry in the future. 
  Transfer Pricing Regulation.    In the United States and many other countries, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations that are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported by our U.S. or international entities and are taxed accordingly. We have adopted transfer prices, which are supported by formal transfer pricing studies for the sale of products to our subsidiaries in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws. In addition, we have entered into agreements with our subsidiaries for services and other contractual obligations, such as the payment of Associate incentives that are also supported by the same formal transfer pricing studies. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our standard transfer pricing practices for products, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings could be adversely affected. The tax treaties between the United States and most countries provide competent authority for relief to avoid any double taxation. We believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing regulations or that those laws will not be modified, which may require that we change our operating procedures. 
       Intellectual Property 
 Trademarks.    We have developed and use registered trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own 25 trademarks that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third-party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We have filed applications and own trademark registrations, and we intend to register additional trademarks in countries outside the United States where USANA products are or may be sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection in the United States. 
         We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of USANA and the effective marketing of USANA products. Trademark registration once obtained is essentially perpetual, subject to the payment of a renewal fee. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete. 
  Trade Secrets.    We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets, but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws. 
  Patents.    We have three U.S. patents. Two of our patents relate to the method of extracting an antioxidant from olives and the byproducts of olive oil production. These patents were issued in 2002 
 25

   and will continue in force until December 20, 2019. Our third patent relates to a method of self-preserving our Sensé line of personal care products. This patent was issued in May 2007 and will continue in force until August 5, 2024. 
         We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any intellectual property litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel. 
       Seasonality 
        Although we are not significantly affected by seasonality, we do experience variations in the activity of our Associates in many of our markets in the first and fourth quarters around major cultural events such as Chinese New Year and Christmas. 
       Backlog 
        Our products are typically shipped within 72 hours after receipt of an order. As of February 23, 2018 we had no significant backlog of orders. 
       Working Capital Practices 
        We maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock in order to provide a high level of service to our customers. Substantial inventories are required to meet the needs of our dual role as manufacturer and distributor. We also watch seasonal commodity markets and may buy ahead of normal demand to hedge against cost increases and supply risks. 
       Environment Laws 
        We are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal, state, or local laws relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations. 
       Employees 
        As of February 23, 2018 we had approximately 1,810 employees worldwide, as measured by full-time equivalency. Our employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced work stoppages as a result of labor disputes. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
