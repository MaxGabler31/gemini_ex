ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General.



We are a leukemia-focused biotechnology company that has been developing therapeutics to address the unmet need that exists for acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and other forms of leukemia and lymphoma. AML is generally a disease of older adults, with onset typically after the age of 45 (average patient age approximately 68 years old). Our strategy is to develop small molecule drug candidates targeting two genes: NPM1 and LSD1, which are considered to control major pathways underlying etiology of majority of AML sub-types.



RASP-201 is a novel, orally dosed, selective reversible inhibitor of lysine specific demethylase, or LSD1, a pathway that blocks differentiation and confers a poor prognosis to AML. We expect RASP-201 to display a safer metabolic profile than competitor irreversible inhibitors such as GSK2879552 (GlaxoSmithKline) and ORY-1001 (Oryzon/Roche). RASP-201 when dosed orally shows in vivo therapeutic utility in murine (mouse) models of AML.



RASP-301 is our innovative, first- in-class, oral, small molecule inhibitor that in preclinical studies has been shown to disrupt NPM1 oligomerization (aggregation of individual subunits) and has the potential to treat refractory AML with reduced toxicity at low dose levels. RASP-301 exhibits cytotoxic effects at nanomolar concentrations against AML cells in culture and was not cytotoxic to normal cells at the same concentrations. In vivo usefulness of these compounds in AML murine models has been evaluated confirming the druggability of the target and its potential to treat refractory AML.

Our primary indication is AML which may be fatal within weeks to months, has a 5-year survival rate of only about 25% and very poor prospects for long-term survival of patients. Treatment options for AML comprise a variety of chemotherapy regimens, biologic agents, and stem cell transplantation. Current standard chemotherapy regimens cure only a minority of patients with AML. As a result, all patients should be evaluated for entry into well-designed clinical trials. If a clinical trial is not available, the patient can be treated with standard therapy. For consolidation chemotherapy or for the management of toxic effects of chemotherapy, readmission is required. Our strategy is to target master regulators of cancer through deep knowledge of highly conserved pathways that are common to leukemia sub-types. Employing a multi-pronged approach, our programs are focused on three druggable intervention points with a potential to improve safety and efficacy of current AML mono and/or combination therapies.



Leukemia Overview and Market Opportunity



Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow involving abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, called WBCs or leukocytes. Leukemia is caused by a mutation of the DNA in bone marrow stem cells resulting in the abnormal multiplication of leukocytes. If untreated, surplus leukocytes will overwhelm the bone marrow, enter the bloodstream and eventually invade other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and central nervous system. In this way, the behavior of leukemia is different from that of other cancers, which usually begin in major organs and ultimately spread to the bone marrow. Leukemia is an umbrella term covering a large group of blood cancers.



All leukemia arises from mutations or damage to the DNA within the blood cells. These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances. Ionizing radiation, as well as exposure to chemicals such as benzene, increases the risk of AML, while agricultural chemicals have been linked to an increased incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. A weak immune system, some virus forms such as human T-cell Leukemia virus I, or HTLV-1, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking, and reactions to some therapeutic drugs are also implicated in the etiology of leukemia.



Diagnosis, Treatment, and Management



The first symptoms of leukemia are often vague and are correlated with other disorders. Common symptoms include fatigue and malaise, excessive bruising, and abnormal bleeding due to low platelet count. Further symptoms can include weight loss, bone and joint pain, infection and fever, and an enlarged spleen, lymph nodes and liver. After a blood test, several blood abnormalities such as anemia, or leucopenia may be observed, and in most cases a bone marrow test is required to confirm the diagnosis.



The preliminary diagnostic test for leukemia is a blood cell count, which is followed by immune-phenotyping to assess whether the abnormal lymphocyte levels are caused by inflammation or cancer. The physician may also require additional confirmatory tests such as cytogenetic analysis or bone marrow sampling.



The specific variety and combination of anticancer drugs prescribed depends on the form and stage of the disease. For example, treatment for AML, the most common form of leukemia, usually involves chemotherapy with cytotoxic cytarabine in conjunction with an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin. Because of the severity of the cytotoxic treatment, bone marrow transplants, or BMTs are sometimes necessary. By transplanting healthy bone marrow into the body, BMTs help rebuild tissue damaged by the treatment. Interferon, or INF, therapy, particularly with INF-alpha, is an alternative or additional treatment offered to almost all newly diagnosed patients in these markets. However, it is very difficult to cure, even though early treatment indicates it will help people to live longer.



The standard first-line treatment strategy for CLL for patients who might not be able to tolerate the side effects of strong chemotherapy is to be treated with chlorambucil alone or with a monoclonal antibody like rituximab (Rituxan) or obinutuzumab (Gazyva). Other options include ibrutinib (Imbruvica), rituximab alone, or a corticosteroid like prednisone.



Other drugs or combinations of drugs may also be also used. If the only problem is an enlarged spleen or swollen lymph nodes in one region of the body, localized treatment with low-dose radiation therapy may be used. Splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen) is another option if the enlarged spleen is causing symptoms.



In addition, very high numbers of leukemia cells in the blood causes problems with normal circulation. This is called leukostasis. Leukapheresis is also sometimes used before chemotherapy if there are very high numbers of leukemia cells (even when they aren’t causing problems) to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.





2







Upon the failure of first line therapy, the standard therapy is usually to administer many of the drugs and combinations listed above as potential second-line treatments. For many people who have already had fludarabine, alemtuzumab seems to be helpful as second-line treatment, but it carries an increased risk of infections. Other purine analog drugs, such as pentostatin or cladribine (2-CdA), may also be tried. Newer drugs such as ofatumumab, ibrutinib, idelalisib (Zydelig), and venetoclax (Venclexta) may be other options. If these types of chemotherapy fail, the next option is usually a bone marrow transplant. A stem cell transplant is a third treatment option depending on leukemia response.



Our business strategy focuses on differentiated targeted therapies for genetic pathways which are known to be involved in etiologies of number of leukemia and other cancers. Our clinical program is based around three druggable intervention points with potential to improve safety and efficacy of current AML therapies, namely “stemness” (activation of stem cell-like growth patterns), cell signaling (between nucleus and cytoplasm) and stress-induced apoptosis (programmed cell death). Our focus is to target two specific genetic pathways NPM1 and LSD1, which are known to be associated with etiologies of a number of cancers, including AML (Figure 1).



Figure 1 Key Regulators for Developing Targeted AML Therapies






Roles of NPM1 and LSD1 in Tumorigenesis



Leukemia arises due to DNA damage or mutations. Chromosomal aberrations involving NPM1 and LSD1 have been found in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and AML. Thus, targeting NPM1 and LSD1 is an appropriate approach for treatment of AML. In addition, combination of therapies targeting these two genes could also be effective in treatment of relapse AML.



The NPM1 gene is up-regulated, mutated and chromosomally translocated in many tumor types. NPM1 is transferred from nucleolus to nucleoplasm and cytoplasm by anticancer drugs. When expressed at high level, NPM1 could promote tumor growth by inactivation of tumor suppressor p53/ARF pathway; when expressed at low level, NPM1 could suppress tumor growth by inhibition of centrosome duplication. NPM1 is haplo insufficient in hemizygous mice that are vulnerable to tumor development. NPM1c+ (cytoplasm form) translocation into cytoplasm could serve as an AML remission signal. NPM1 forms a pentamer that could serve as a potential anticancer target. Our technology (the process of targeting the mutation of the NPM1 gene), is believed to inhibit the NPM1 gene, reducing levels of NPM1 and consequently reducing a tumor cell’s ability to duplicate. High affinity, NPM1 binding molecules exhibiting cytotoxic activity on AML cells and safe on normal cells have been identified.

The histone H3K4/K9 demethylase LSD1 can regulate gene activation and repression in epigenetic regulation and is a key effector of the differentiation block in MLL-rearranged leukemia. High LSD1 expression blocks differentiation and is associated with a poor prognosis in AML. LSD1 can be targeted by tranylcypromine analogs or downregulated by RNA interference which induces differentiation of MLL-rearranged leukemic cells. A number of different small molecular inhibitors of LSD1 have been in clinical evaluation. While this class of inhibitors has shown clinical activity in AML patients, toxicities associated with irreversible inhibitors prohibited their further development. Reversible inhibitors of LSD1 have shown good potential for further development.



Other Leukemias



Differences between the different leukemias are dependent on the types of cells involved. Myeloid leukemias originate in the bone marrow and involve granulocytes, white and red blood cells. Lymphoid leukemias, including lymphomas, originate in the lymph nodes and lymphoid tissue but involve immune cells including lymphocytes, T cells and B cells. MDS are group of bone marrow failure disorders that have various subtypes with variable onsets, prognoses and risks of developing leukemia. 



RASP-201 (LSD1)



LSD1 is an enzyme that demethylates (remove methyl groups) lysine side chain of histones. The levels of LSD1 are elevated (overexpressed) in several human cancers as compared to healthy normal adults. In AML, elevated levels of LSD1 are observed in less differentiated blood cells (immature cells). Inhibition of the enzyme activity was found to promote differentiation. Hence, inhibitors of LSD1 are promising therapeutic candidates that can make drug-insensitive forms of AML, due to reduced levels of methylated histones, responsive to treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid, or ATRA an agent that induces differentiation (maturation)and used to treat a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL.



Working from this premise, we executed a research agreement with TES Pharma for screening of compounds and to conduct animal studies to identify lead compounds with suitable druggability properties. TES Pharma has screened ~34000 compounds across 4 chemical series for their ability to inhibit LSD1 in vitro. The hit rate was ~1%. The hits from this assay were expanded and IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values were determined for 115 compounds. One chemical class namely, Thienopyrrole series was prioritized for further expansion and in vitro characterization.



We have filed patent applications covering this novel potent inhibitor class. The current lead compound DDP_43242 inhibitory effect on the LSD1 in in-vitro assay and in-vivo efficacy in two AML animal models.



These studies have facilitated the selection of DDP_43242 as the current lead compound. Additional absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, or ADME, and selectivity characterization is underway for drug candidate selection for clinical trials. We anticipate filing an investigation new drug application, or IND, in the near future. We believe that this breakthrough program may have significant benefits across all forms of leukemia. We are focusing on reversible small molecular inhibitors of LSD1 because these compounds are expected to exhibit less toxicity while retaining desirable efficacy.



RASP-301 (NPM1)



The NPM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called nucleophosmin (NPM) which is found in a small region inside the nucleus of the cell called the nucleolus. Nucleophosmin shuttles back and forth between the nucleus and the fluid surrounding it (the cytoplasm). Nucleophosmin helps to transport other proteins from ribosomes (sites of protein synthesis) through the membrane surrounding the nucleus. The NPM-1 gene is mutated in approximately 35% of new cases of AML. However, mutations in the NPM1 gene, result in dislocation of NPM1 protein in the cytoplasm. NPM1 mutation may be an early event in development of leukemia. Given that NPM1 is thought to have a tumor-suppressor function, alterations in its localization in the cell (from the nucleus to the cytoplasm) may be crucial for the cell to change from normal to cancerous state. Our approach is to identify small molecule drugs that physically interfere with the aggregation of NPM1 which is important for normal function. RASP-301 is our innovative, first- in-class, oral, small molecule, potent inhibitor that disrupts NPM1-1 oligomerization (aggregation of individual subunits) and has the potential to treat refractory (resistant to treatment) AML with reduced toxicity at low dose levels The current lead candidate, TES-2169, exhibits cytotoxic (toxic to cancer cells) effects at nanomolar concentrations against AML cells in culture and was not cytotoxic to normal cells at the same concentrations. In vivo usefulness of these compounds in AML murine (mouse) models has been evaluated confirming the druggability of the target and its potential to treat refractory AML.

Strategy



Our strategy is to target master regulators of cancer through deep knowledge of highly conserved pathways that are common to leukemia sub-types. Employing a multi-pronged approach, our programs are focused on two druggable intervention points with a potential to improve safety and efficacy of current AML mono and/or combination therapies. For the RASP-201 program, the lead reversible LSD-1 candidate has been identified and manufacturing will be scaled for production of cGMP supplies for animal safety/toxicology studies, Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies to support submission via the traditional 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway used for new chemical entities, or NCEs. We expect to use a similar pathway for the RASP-301 program, following identification of the lead drug candidate.

● | Complete development of orally-available, small molecule, highly-selective, reversible inhibitor of LSD1 (RASP-201) and file IND in the near future. Manufacture of the lead RASP -201 candidate will be scaled to supply animal safety/toxicology studies and Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies following the traditional 505(b)(1) pathway used for marketing approval of NCEs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Selection of a lead candidate for first in class NPM1 inhibitor (RASP-301). 
● | Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the commercial potential of the drug candidates. Such opportunities may include partnering to achieve business objectives and achieve maximum return on investment. 

Research Agreement



On December 17, 2013 TES Pharma S.R.L. (“TES”) and our predecessor, Arna Therapeutics Limited, entered into a research agreement pursuant to which TES agreed to perform research related to the development of products and services associated with NPM1 and AML. The initial term of the agreement was for two years and was extended by amendment on May 3, 2016 for an additional year. On September 8, 2016, the agreement was assigned to our subsidiary, Rasna Research, Inc. The agreement was further extended on March 24, 2017 until August 30, 2017. We are currently in discussions with TES Pharma S.R.L, profiling the next stage of research activity to be included in a new research agreement.
Manufacturing



We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
Commercialization



We plan to retain our worldwide commercialization rights for some of our key product candidates while for other product candidates we might consider partnership opportunities to maximize returns.



While we currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, we intend to build our own commercialization organization and capabilities over time. When appropriate, we will decide whether to build a specialty sales force to manage commercialization for these product candidates on our own or in combination with a larger pharmaceutical partner, to maximize patient coverage in the United States and to support global expansion especially as our programs have substantial opportunity for additional follow-up indications alone or in combinations.



As product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of a commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our United States, European Union and rest-of-world strategies



Government Regulation



The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.

U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products



In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.



The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:




○ | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our products in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | submission to the FDA of a NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


○ | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of preclinical studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the new investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.



Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s Institutional Review Board, or IRB, before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.



The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:




1. | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




A pivotal study is any clinical study, which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies but may also be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.



Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.



The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.

In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.



In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.



The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.



The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it typically follows such recommendations.



The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug product. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.



We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in, among other things,




● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------




Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Also, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.



Marketing Exclusivity



Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active pharmaceutical ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments: 505(b)(2) approval process



Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug, or RLD. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the RLD. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.



In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a ‘‘section viii’’ statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.



Our current and anticipated product candidates will be based on already approved active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, rather than new chemical entities, and a formulation that has been through Phase 1 studies. Accordingly, we expect to be able to rely on information from previously conducted formulation studies involving our clinical development plans and our NDA submissions. For product candidates that involve novel fixed-dose combinations of existing drugs or for studies of an existing product or product candidate in a new indication, we believe we generally will be able to initiate Phase 2/3 studies without conducting any new non-clinical or Phase 1 studies, though the FDA may not agree with our conclusions and may require us to conduct additional clinical or preclinical studies prior to initiating Phase 3 or other pivotal clinical trials. In those instances where our product candidate is a pharmacokinetically enhanced version of an approved API, we will need to conduct certain non-clinical and Phase 1 studies to confirm the pharmacokinetic profile of the product candidate prior to conducting Phase 2/3 studies.



U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 



The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 



Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug and biologic product candidates which obtain marketing approval. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical manufacturers are exposed, directly, or indirectly, through customers, to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which a pharmaceutical manufacturer can market, sell and distribute drug and biologic products. These laws include, but are not limited to:



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in-kind, to induce or reward either the referring of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally financed healthcare program. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.



The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, benefits, items or services.



HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.



The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.



State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.





11







State and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers, and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.



Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.



Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations.



Healthcare Reform in the United States



In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect the future results of pharmaceutical manufactures’ operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Most recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, was enacted in March 2010, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implementation of the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act”;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






12








● | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, former President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA.



Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, the full effect that the PPACA would have on a pharmaceutical manufacturer remains unclear. In particular, there is uncertainty surrounding the applicability of the biosimilars provisions under the PPACA. The FDA has issued several guidance documents, but no implementing regulations, on biosimilars. A number of biosimilar applications have been approved over the past few years. The regulations that are ultimately promulgated and their implementation are likely to have considerable impact on the way pharmaceutical manufacturers conduct their business and may require changes to current strategies. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved drug notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the approved drug in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.



Individual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce ultimate demand for certain products or put pressure product pricing, which could negatively affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.



In addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While no one cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to generate revenue. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States could put competitive pressure on a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to profitably price products, which, in turn, could adversely affect business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. A pharmaceutical manufacturer might elect not to seek approval for or market products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue generated from product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.



Furthermore, regulatory authorities’ assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. No one can be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.

International Regulations



In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.



To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.



If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.



Centralized Procedure



The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.



There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.



In the EU, medicinal products designated as orphan drug products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of marketing exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan drugs: (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.





14







Other Regulations 



We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Reimbursement



Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that can require the provision of supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of drug or biologic products to the payor. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers operating costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of product from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.



There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict what third party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for new drug and biologic product candidates. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products could have a material adverse effect on a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and overall financial condition.



Reimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product which obtains marketing approval. Even if coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.



The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.



In addition, it is expected that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities will continue and place further pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products that gain regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.





15







Intellectual Property



Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents and other proprietary protections of our commercially important technologies and product candidates, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to maintain trade secrets or other proprietary know-how, both in the United States and other countries. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products will depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that protect these activities. We seek to protect proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties.



We have two active patent families relating to our dactinomycin program. Currently, we have one granted US patent and ten pending patent applications in these families in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan. 



We also have an exclusive license to patents and patent applications across seven different patent families relating to our LSD1 program. We currently have four granted patents and two pending application in the U.S. We also have granted patents and/or pending applications in these families in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, and South Africa. 



The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether the product candidates we are developing will gain patent protection or, if patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented, invalidated, or found to be unenforceable. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions or filing dates covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant proceedings, interference proceedings, or third-party ex parte or inter partes reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, any of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid and enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights.



The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. Certain of our patents currently benefit from patent term adjustment and some of our patents issuing in the future may benefit from patent term adjustment.



The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved product may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the product is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved product may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved product. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent-term extensions on patents covering those products.



To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and there can be no assurance that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications.





16







We intend to seek orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication.



We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. However, we believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our products.



It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be and are our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.



Competition



The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.



Several types of existing treatments may be used for people with AML. The main treatments include chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, stem cell transplants and/or interferon therapy. In most cases AML can progress rapidly, so it is important to start treatment as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat AML. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.



There are other companies and research institutions working to develop therapies that target AML. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.



A listing of approved products currently used for treatment of AML include the following: topoisomerase II inhibitors, e.g., Cerubidine® (daunorubicin HCL, Bedford Labs), Novantrone® (mitoxantrone HCL, Pfizer) and Idamycin® (idarubicin HCl, Pfizer); alkylating agents, e.g., Cytoxan® (cyclophosphamide, Baxter); DNA polymerase inhibitors, e.g,. Cytarabine® (cytarabine, Pfizer); DNA binding agents, e.g., Doxil® (doxorubicin HCl liposome, Alza); purine analogs, e.g., Tabloid® (thioguanine, GlaxoSmithKline); mitotic spindle inhibitors, e.g., Vincasar PFS® (vincristine sulfate, Teva); DNA fragmentation agents, e.g,. Trisenox® (arsenic trioxide, Cephalon); FLT3 inhibitors, e.g., Rydapt® (midostaurin, Novartis); IDH2 inhibitors, e.g., IDHIFA® (enasidenib mesylate, Celgene).

A listing of AML drugs in advanced clinical development by our competitors include the following: (irreversible) LSD-1 inhibitors, e.g. ORY-1001 (Oryzon); FLT3 inhibitors, e.g., quizartinib (Daiichi Sankyo), crenolanib (Arog Pharma) and gilteritinib (Astellas); topoisomerase inhibitors, e.g., Vosaroxin® (qinprezo, Sunesis Pharma), CPX-351 (vyxeos, Celator Pharma); DNA hypomethylating agents, e.g., guadecditabine (ASTX Pharma); PLK1 inhibitors, e.g., volasertib (Boehringer Ingelheim); IDH2 inhibitors, e.g., enasidenib (Agios Pharma); IDH1 inhibitors, e.g., ivosidenib (Agios Pharma); DOT1L ihibitors, e.g., pinometostat (Epizyme); BCL2 inhibitors, e.g., venetoclax (Roche); BET inhibitors, e.g., OTX-015 (OncoEthix) and HDAC inhibitors, e.g., pracinostat (MEI Pharma).



A large number of irreversible inhibitors of LSD1 have been developed by major pharmaceutical companies and research institutes. Among them, ORY-1001 and GSK2879552, two TCP derivatives, developed by Oryzon Genomics and GSK, respectively, have been in Phase 1 clinical trials for treatment of AML We have focused on development of reversible inhibitors instead of irreversible inhibitors with the expectation of better therapeutic effect, safety profiles and lower toxicity compared to the irreversible inhibitors



The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our targets, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.



Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are many generic products currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
