Certain statements in this Annual Report, including in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Generally, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “project,” “outlook,” “target,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “seek,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” “goal,” “strategy,” “future,” “maintain,” and “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. Examples of forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K include, among others, statements regarding:
•Future market conditions, including anticipated car and other sales levels and the supply of inventory
•Our business strategy and plans, including our achieving our 2025 Plan (or “50/50” Plan)

•Our compliance with financial and restrictive covenants in our credit facility and other debt agreements
•Our programs and initiatives for employee recruitment, training, and retention
•Our strategies for customer retention, growth, market position, financial results and risk management
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimated or projected results include, without limitation, the factors as discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and, from time to time, in our other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
Overview
Lithia Motors, Inc. is a growth company focused on profitably consolidating the largest retail sector in North America. We are among the fastest growing companies in the Fortune 500 and are currently ranked #231 (#2 on 10-year EPS growth, #3 on 10-year total shareholder return and #12 on 10-year revenue growth in 2021). As of December 31, 2021, we operated 278 locations representing 40 brands in two countries, across 25 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. The majority of our revenues are generated within the U.S. and the majority of our property and equipment is located within the U.S.
Lithia and Driveway (LAD) offers a wide array of products and services fulfilling the entire vehicle ownership lifecycle including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance products and automotive repair and maintenance. We strive for diversification in our products, services, brands and geographic locations to reduce dependence on any one manufacturer, reduce susceptibility to changing consumer preferences, manage market risk and maintain profitability. Our diversification, along with our operating structure, provides a resilient and nimble business model.
LAD’s omni-channel strategy pragmatically disrupts the industry by leveraging our experienced teams, vast owned inventories, technology and physical network. We continue to lead the industry’s consolidation and, combined with Driveway’s e-commerce in-home experiences and Driveway Finance Corporation’s growing auto loan portfolio, further accelerates our massive profit and capital engine. Together, these endeavors create a unique and compelling high-growth strategy that provides transportation solutions wherever, whenever and however consumers desire.
Founded in 1946 and incorporated in Oregon in 1968, we completed our initial public offering in 1996.
Business Strategy
We seek to provide customers a seamless, blended online and physical retail experience with broad selection and access to specialized expertise and knowledge. Our physical network enables us to provide convenient touch points for customers and provide services throughout the vehicle life cycle. We seek to increase market share and optimize profitability by focusing on the consumer experience and applying proprietary performance measurement systems fueled by data science. Our Driveway and GreenCars brands provide convenient, simple, and transparent platforms that serve as our e-commerce home solutions and allow us to deliver differentiated, proprietary digital experiences. Complimenting our in-store experiences, Driveway and GreenCars provide consumers more choices while further leveraging our network of people, inventory and locations and capturing additional earnings. 
Our long-term strategy to create value for our customers, employees and shareholders includes the following elements:
Driving operational excellence, innovation and diversification
LAD builds magnetic brand loyalty in our 278 stores and with Driveway, our e-commerce home delivery experience, and GreenCars, our electric vehicle learning resource and marketplace. Operational excellence is achieved by focusing the business on convenient and transparent consumer experiences supported by proprietary data science to improve market share, consumer loyalty, and profitability. By promoting an entrepreneurial model with our in-store experiences, we build strong businesses responsive to each of our local markets. Utilizing performance-based action plans, we develop high-performing teams and foster manufacturer relationships. 
In response to evolving consumer preferences, we invest in modernization that supports and expands our core business. These digital strategies combine our experienced, knowledgeable workforce with our owned inventory and physical network of stores, enabling us to be agile and adapt to consumer preferences and market specific conditions. Additionally, we systematically explore transformative adjacencies, which are identified to be synergistic and complementary to our existing business such as Driveway Finance Corporation, our captive auto loan portfolio.
Our investments in modernization are well under way and are taking hold with our teams as they provide digital shopping experiences including finance, contactless test drives and home delivery or curbside pickup for vehicle purchases. Our people and these solutions power our national brands, overlaying our physical footprint in a way that we believe attracts a larger population of digital consumers seeking transparent, empowered, flexible and simple buying and servicing experiences.
Our performance-based culture is geared toward an incentive-based compensation structure for a majority of our personnel. We develop pay plans that are measured based upon various factors such as customer satisfaction, profitability and individual performance metrics. These plans serve to reward team members for creating customer loyalty, achieving store potential, developing high-performing talent, meeting and exceeding manufacturer requirements and living our core values. 
We have centralized many administrative functions to drive efficiencies and streamline store-level operations. The reduction of administrative functions at our stores allows our local managers to focus on customer-facing opportunities to increase revenues and gross profit. Our operations are supported by regional and corporate 
management, as well as dedicated training and personnel development programs which allow us to share best practices across our network and develop management talent.
Growth through acquisition and network optimization
Our acquisition growth strategy has been successful both financially and culturally. Our disciplined approach focuses on acquiring new vehicle franchises, which operate in markets ranging from mid-sized regional markets to metropolitan markets. Acquisition of these businesses increases our proximity to consumers throughout the United States. While we target annual after tax return of more than 15% for our acquisitions, we have averaged over a 25% return by the third year of ownership due to a disciplined approach focusing on accretive, cash flow positive targets at reasonable valuations. In addition to being financially accretive, acquisitions aim to drive network growth that improves our ability to serve customers through vast selection, greater density and access to customers and ability to leverage national branding and advertising.
As we focus on expanding our physical network of stores, one of the criteria we evaluate is a valuation multiple between 3x to 7x of investment in intangibles to estimated annualized adjusted EBITDA, with various factors including location, ability to expand our network and talent considered in determining value. We also target an investment in intangibles as a percentage of annualized revenues in the range of 15% to 30%. 
During 2021, we acquired 77 stores, opened one store, and divested nine stores. We invested $2.3 billion, net of floor plan debt, to acquire these stores and we expect these acquisitions to add nearly $7.0 billion in expected annual revenues.
We regularly optimize and balance our network through strategic divestitures to ensure continued high performance. We believe our disciplined approach provides us with attractive acquisition opportunities and expanded coast-to-coast coverage.
Thoughtful capital allocation
We manage our liquidity and available cash to support our long-term plan focused on growth through acquisitions, investments in our national e-commerce home solution, Driveway, and our existing business. Our free cash flow deployment strategy targets an allocation of 65% investment in acquisitions, 25% investment in capital expenditures, innovation, and diversification and 10% in shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2021, we invested in our facilities, utilizing $260.4 million for capital expenditures, and paid $38.8 million in dividends. As of December 31, 2021, we had available liquidity of $1.5 billion, which was comprised of $174.8 million in cash and $1.3 billion availability on our credit facilities and unfloored new vehicle inventory. In addition, our unfinanced real estate could provide additional liquidity of approximately $1.0 billion.
Marketing
One of our core values, Earn Customers for Life, defines our market strategy by appealing to our consumers’ desire for affordability, transparency and convenience. We employ national, regional and local brands to connect with consumers with advertising tailored to the individual brand and market. Utilizing data analysis and multi-channel communications, we strive to attract and retain customers throughout the vehicle ownership life cycle.
With a vast selection represented by the nation’s largest vehicle inventory for sale online, we employ search engine optimization, search engine marketing, online display, re-targeting, social advertising, traditional media and direct marketing to reach consumers. Most consumers begin their shopping, buying or selling activity on our store websites, Driveway, and GreenCars. These 300+ online channels provide customers with simple, transparent ways to manage their vehicle ownership including: search new and used inventories, view current pricing, apply incentives and offers, calculate payments for purchase or lease, apply for financing, buy online, sell their vehicle, schedule service appointments, schedule vehicle pick-up and delivery, and provide us feedback about their experience. During 2021, our unique visitors increased 39% on a same store basis. 
Total advertising expense, net of manufacturer credits, was $162.2 million in 2021, $97.4 million in 2020 and $111.9 million in 2019. In 2021, we spent 87% on digital, social, listings and owner communications, while 13% was spent on traditional media. In all of our communications, we seek to convey the promise of a positive customer experience, competitive pricing and wide selection. We expect the portion of spending in digital channels to continue to increase as traditional media evolves to online consumption models.
Our manufacturer partners influence a significant portion of our advertising expense. Certain advertising and marketing expenditures are offset by manufacturer cooperative programs, which require us to submit requests for reimbursement to manufacturers for qualifying advertising expenditures. These advertising credits are not tied to specific vehicles and are earned as qualifying expenses are incurred. These reimbursements are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense. Manufacturer cooperative advertising credits were $35.6 million in 2021, $23.9 million in 2020 and $27.9 million in 2019.
Franchise Agreements
Each of our stores operates under a separate Franchise Agreement with the manufacturer of the new vehicle brand it sells.
Typical automobile Franchise Agreements specify the locations within a designated market area at which the store may sell vehicles and related products and perform approved services. The designation of the market areas and the allocation of new vehicles among stores are at the discretion of the manufacturer. Franchise Agreements do not, however, guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory.
A Franchise Agreement may impose requirements on the store with respect to:
•facilities and equipment; 
•inventories of vehicles and parts; 
•minimum working capital; 
•training of personnel; and 
•performance standards for market share and customer satisfaction.
Each manufacturer closely monitors compliance with these requirements and requires each store to submit monthly financial statements. Franchise Agreements also grant a store the right to use and display manufacturers’ trademarks, service marks and designs in the manner approved by each manufacturer.
We have determined the useful life of a Franchise Agreement is indefinite, even though certain Franchise Agreements are renewed after one to six years. In our experience, agreements are routinely renewed without substantial cost and there are legal remedies to help prevent termination. Certain Franchise Agreements have no termination date. In addition, state franchise laws protect franchised automotive retailers. Under certain laws, a manufacturer may not terminate or fail to renew a franchise without good cause or prevent any reasonable changes in the capital structure or financing of a store.
Our typical Franchise Agreement provides for early termination or non-renewal by the manufacturer upon:
•a change of management or ownership without manufacturer consent;
•insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealer; 
•death or incapacity of the dealer/manager;
•conviction of a dealer/manager or owner of certain crimes;
•misrepresentation of certain sales or inventory information to the manufacturer;
•failure to adequately operate the store;
•failure to maintain any license, permit or authorization required for the conduct of business;
•poor market share; or 
•low customer satisfaction index scores.
Franchise Agreements generally provide for prior written notice before a franchise may be terminated under most circumstances. We also sign master framework agreements with most manufacturers that impose additional requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Competition
The retail automotive business is highly competitive. Currently, there are more than 16,500 new vehicle franchise dealers in the United States, many of which are independent stores managed by individuals, families or small retail groups. We compete primarily with other automotive retailers, both publicly- and privately-held and other online automotive retailers such as CarMax, Carvana, Shift and Vroom.
Vehicle manufacturers have designated specific marketing and sales areas within which only one dealer of a vehicle brand may operate. In addition, our Franchise Agreements typically limit our ability to acquire multiple dealerships of a given brand within a particular market area. Certain state franchise laws also restrict us from relocating our 
dealerships, or establishing new dealerships of a particular brand, within any area that is served by another dealer with the same brand. To the extent that a market has multiple dealers of a particular brand, as certain markets we operate in do, we are subject to significant intra-brand competition. 
We are larger and have more financial resources than most private automotive retailers with which we currently compete in the majority of our regional markets. We compete directly with retailers with similar or greater resources in our existing metro and non-metro markets. We also compete based on dealer reputation in the various markets. If we enter other new markets, we may face competitors that have access to greater financial resources or have strong brands. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers. We rely on advertising and merchandising, pricing, our customer guarantees and sales model, our sales expertise, service reputation and the location of our stores to sell new vehicles.
Regulation
Automotive and Other Laws and Regulations
We operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of state and federal laws and regulations affect our business. In every state in which we operate, we must obtain various licenses to operate our businesses, including dealer, sales and finance and insurance licenses issued by state regulatory authorities. Numerous laws and regulations govern our business, including those relating to our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. These laws and regulations include state franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, privacy laws, escheatment laws, anti-money laundering laws and federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Our financing activities with customers are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. In recent years, there has been an increase in activity related to oversight of consumer lending by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad regulatory powers. The CFPB has supervisory authority over large nonbank auto finance companies, including Driveway Finance Corporation. The CFPB can use this authority to conduct supervisory examinations to ensure compliance with various federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB does not have direct authority over automotive dealers; however, its regulation of larger automotive finance companies and other financial institutions could affect our financing activities. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or our stores by individuals, a class of individuals, or governmental entities. These claims may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct store operations and fines.
The vehicles we sell are also subject to rules and regulations of various federal and state regulatory agencies.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws and Regulations
Our operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and fuel. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.
Most of our stores use above ground storage tanks, and, to a lesser extent, underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from our operations. Similarly, certain air emissions from operations, such as auto body painting, may be subject to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Health and safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies also apply.
Certain stores may become a party to proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, typically in connection with materials that were sent to former recycling, treatment and/or disposal facilities owned and operated by independent businesses. The remediation or clean-up of facilities where the release of a regulated hazardous substance occurred is required under CERCLA and other laws.
We incur certain costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We do not anticipate, however, that the costs of compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, although such outcome is possible given the nature of our operations and the extensive environmental, public health and safety regulatory framework. We may become aware of minor contamination at certain of our facilities, and we conduct investigations and remediation at properties as needed. In certain cases, the current or prior property owner may conduct the investigation and/or remediation or we have been indemnified by either the current or prior property owner for such contamination. We do not currently expect to incur significant costs for remediation. However, we cannot provide assurance that material environmental commitments or contingencies will not arise in the future, or that they do not already exist but are unknown to us.
Human Capital
Driven by our mission statement, “Growth Powered by People,” we place a high degree of value in each of our team members and their individual professional success. Promoting and hiring the best talent available, defining clear expectations, providing excellent training and rewarding performance helps us build dynamic teams to serve our customers. We cultivate an entrepreneurial, high-performance culture and strive to develop leaders from within. We continue to develop tools, training and growth opportunities that accelerate the depth of our talent. 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 21,150 persons on a full-time equivalent basis in our North American network of 278 retail locations. Our total workforce was comprised of approximately 18% female employees and approximately 44% of minorities. Our management consisted of approximately 17% females and approximately 35% minorities in leadership positions. In both 2021 and 2020, approximately 95% of our workforce earned above minimum wage.
Some examples of our key programs and initiatives that are focused on attracting, retaining and developing our high performing workforce include:
•AMP program (Accelerate My Potential), which began in 2016, is designed to deepen the knowledge of future leaders in all aspects of our business and develop leadership skills to better position participants for a future as a general manager in one of our stores. 
•Lithia Women Lead, which began in 2015, provides an avenue for women in the organization to connect, learn and develop. The program includes events throughout the year that provide women in the organization the opportunity to network, act as role models and inspire one another’s growth.
•Culture Council, which began in 2021, is designed to promote diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) in our workforce by identifying areas to improve, raising awareness, and integrating DEI elements into how we operate, train and develop our teams. The Culture Council is comprised of a diverse group of executive level and non-executive level members, who work together to have our employees reflect the diversity of our customers, reinforce our mission and culture and enhance employee engagement.
•Talent development promotes employee professional development through various programs including tuition reimbursement programs covering up to 75% of an employee’s undergraduate or graduate tuition costs; Master Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) training and certification and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) training for our technicians; and daily on-the-job training resources through our Learning Center.
We also continue to invest in and expand the roles and capabilities of our workforce to drive the development and support of our e-commerce and digital technology capabilities. We believe there is a competitive advantage to integrate and develop individuals with these skill sets and they are an integral part of supporting our five year growth plan and launch of Driveway. As our business evolves, we will remain focused on having human capital capabilities, systems and processes in place to support and align with our strategy.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
In a stable environment, the automotive industry has generally experienced higher volumes of vehicle unit sales in the second and third quarters of each year due to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models and, accordingly, we expect our revenues and operating results to generally be higher during these periods. In addition, we generally experience higher volume of luxury vehicles, which have higher average selling prices and gross profit per vehicle, during the fourth quarter. The timing of our acquisition activity, which varies, and ability to integrate stores into our existing cost structure has moderated this seasonality. However, if conditions occur that weaken automotive sales, such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate, war, 
high fuel costs, depressed economic conditions including unemployment or weakened consumer confidence or similar adverse conditions, or if our ability to acquire stores changes, our revenues for the year may be disproportionately adversely affected.
