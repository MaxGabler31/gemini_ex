Item 1. Business
Company Overview
We are a leading global provider of comprehensive PV solar energy solutions. We design, manufacture, and sell PV solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop, design, construct, and sell PV solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. Additionally, we provide operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services to system owners. We have substantial, ongoing R&D efforts focused on module and system-level innovations. We are the world’s largest thin film PV solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest PV solar module manufacturers. Our mission is to provide cost-advantaged solar technology through innovation, customer engagement, industry leadership, and operational excellence.
In addressing overall global demand for electricity, our high-efficiency CdTe modules and fully integrated systems business provide competitively priced utility-scale PV solar energy solutions, which compete on an economic basis in many climates with traditional forms of energy generation and provide low cost electricity to end-users. Our vertically-integrated capabilities enable us to provide such solutions, accelerate the adoption of our technology, and successfully sell into key markets around the world. We seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain, resulting in more reliable and cost effective PV solar energy solutions for our customers.
Business Strategy
We believe the following strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our leading industry position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of PV solar energy solutions.
Differentiated Technology
As a field-proven technology, our CdTe solar modules offer certain advantages over traditional crystalline silicon based solar modules by delivering competitive efficiency, higher real-world energy yield, and long-term reliability. Proven to deliver up to 8% more usable energy per nameplate watt than competing technologies in certain geographic markets and with a record of reliable system performance, our CdTe technology delivers more energy, more consistently, over the lifetime of a PV solar power system. Our recently introduced Series 6 module technology, with its combination of high conversion efficiencies, low manufacturing costs, larger form factor, and balance of systems (“BoS”) component compatibility, is expected to further enhance our competitive position once production of such module technology begins in 2018. We expect our transition to Series 6 module technology to enable us to maximize the intrinsic cost advantage of CdTe thin film technology versus crystalline silicon.
In terms of energy yield, in many climates our CdTe solar modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating. For example, our CdTe solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°C (standard test conditions). In addition, our CdTe solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards. Our CdTe solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules, which may lose up to three times as much power as CdTe solar modules when shading occurs. As a result of these factors, our PV solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity.
Manufacturing Process
Our modules are manufactured in a high-throughput, automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line. Such manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive 
 3

and time-consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules. At the outset, a sheet of glass enters the production line and in less than 3.5 hours is transformed into a completed module, which is flash tested, boxed, and ready for shipment. With over 17 GW of modules sold worldwide, we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation. We currently have multiple production lines at our manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia and plan to also utilize our manufacturing facility in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for the production of Series 6 modules. As we transition our remaining manufacturing capacity to Series 6 module technology, we expect to ramp down production of our Series 4TM (“Series 4”) modules over the next several years. This transition process, which has resulted in a temporary reduction in production capacity, allows us to use our existing manufacturing infrastructure to more quickly and cost effectively deploy our Series 6 module technology to best position us for long-term competitiveness and growth.
Vertical Integration
We are vertically integrated across substantially the entire solar value chain. Many of the efficiencies, cost reductions, and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not vertically integrated in a similar manner. Accordingly, our operational model offers PV solar energy solutions that benefit from our wide range of capabilities, including: advanced PV solar module manufacturing; project development; engineering and plant optimization; grid integration and plant control systems; procurement and construction consulting; and O&M services.
Financial Viability
Our commitment is to create long-term shareholder value through a balance of growth, profitability, and liquidity. Despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to pricing competition and significant capacity in the industry, we have continued to deliver strong and balanced financial performance. Such performance has also enabled us to fund our Series 6 transition and capacity expansion initiatives using cash flows generated by our operations. Accordingly, our financial viability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders. Our bankability and financial viability also enable us to offer meaningful module and system warranties after installation, which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to some of our peers in the solar industry in the context of project financing and offering PV solar energy solutions to long-term owners.
Sustainability
In addition to our financial commitments, we are also committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle, from raw material sourcing through end-of-life module recycling. Accordingly, our modules and systems provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change, energy security, and water scarcity, which also enables our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives. On a lifecycle basis, our thin film module technology has the smallest carbon footprint, fastest energy payback time, and lowest water use of any PV solar technology on the market.
As a result of our specialized manufacturing process, our modules have approximately half the carbon footprint of conventional crystalline silicon modules and a fraction of the carbon footprint of conventional energy sources. Furthermore, our technology displaces up to 98% of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants when replacing traditional forms of energy generation. Our manufacturing process also facilitates the fastest energy payback time (which is the amount of time a system must operate to recover the energy required to produce it) of all PV solar technologies. In less than six months under high irradiance conditions, our PV solar power systems produce more energy than was required to create them, which represents a 50-fold energy return on investment over a 25-year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid. Our modules also use up to 300 times less water per MW hour than conventional energy and up to 12 times less water than other solar technologies. In addition, our industry-leading recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90% of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90% of the semiconductor material for reuse in new First Solar modules.

Offerings and Capabilities
We are focusing on markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. We differentiate our product offerings by geographic market and localize the solution, as needed. Our consultative approach to our customers’ solar energy needs and capabilities results in customized solutions to meet their economic goals. As a result, we have designed our product and service offerings according to the following business areas:

• | PV Solar Modules. Our modules couple our leading-edge CdTe technology with the manufacturing excellence and quality control that comes from being one of the world’s most experienced producers of advanced PV solar modules. Our technology demonstrates a proven performance advantage over most crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating by delivering competitive efficiency, higher real-world energy yield, and long-term reliability. We are able to provide such product performance, quality, and reliability to our customers due, in large part, to investing more in R&D than any other solar company in the world.


• | Utility-Scale Power Plant. We have extensive, proven experience in developing and constructing reliable grid-connected power systems for utility-scale generation. Our grid-connected PV solar power systems diversify the energy portfolio, reduce fossil-fuel consumption, reduce the risk of fuel price volatility, and save costs, proving that centralized solar generation can deliver dependable and affordable solar electricity to the grid in many places around the world. Our plant control systems provide reliability services, such as frequency control, voltage control, ramping capacity, and automated generation control, which enable expanded integration of PV solar power systems into the power grid. Such reliability services also help balance the grid during times of high renewable energy generation. Our solar energy systems also offer a meaningful value proposition by eliminating commodity price risks thereby providing a long-term fixed price with relatively low operating costs. When compared to the price of power derived from a conventional source of energy, a fixed price cannot be achieved unless the cost of hedging is included. Hedging costs of a commodity such as natural gas, along with the costs of credit support required for a long-term hedge, can significantly increase conventional energy costs. Additional benefits of our grid-connected power systems include reductions of fuel imports and improvements in energy security; enhanced peaking generation and faster time-to-power; and managed variability through accurate forecasting.


• | EPC Services. We provide engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) services to projects developed by us and other system owners such as utilities, independent power producers, and commercial and industrial companies. EPC services include engineering design and related services, BoS procurement, advanced development of grid integration solutions, and construction contracting and management. Depending on the customer and market needs, we may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities. Our vertical integration combined with our partner collaboration enables us to identify and make system-level innovations, which creates further value for our customers.


• | O&M Services. By leveraging our extensive experience in plant optimization and advanced diagnostics, we have developed one of the largest and most advanced O&M programs in the industry, which includes more than 7 GWDC of utility-scale PV solar power systems. Despite this scale, we have historically maintained an average fleet system effective availability greater than 99%. Utilizing a state of the art Global Operations Center, our team of O&M associates provide a variety of services to optimize system performance and comply with power purchase agreements (“PPA”), other agreements, and regulations. Our products and services are engineered to maximize energy output and revenue for our customers while significantly reducing their unplanned maintenance costs. Plant owners benefit from predictable expenses over the life of the contract and reduced risk of energy loss. Our O&M program is compliant with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) standards and is designed to be scalable to accommodate the growing O&M needs of customers worldwide. We offer our O&M services to solar power plant owners that use either our solar modules or modules manufactured by third-parties.

Market Overview
Solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the price of PV solar power systems, and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems, has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. The rapid price decline that PV solar energy has experienced in recent years has opened new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives. The fact that a PV solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets. Once installed, PV solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of energy generation. In addition to these economic benefits, solar energy has substantial environmental benefits. For example, PV solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas and other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation. Worldwide solar markets continue to develop, aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable.
The solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. In particular, module average selling prices in the United States and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years, and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline globally to some degree in the future. In the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. Additionally, intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, EPC companies, and vertically-integrated solar companies such as First Solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. In light of such market realities, we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module and system technologies, our manufacturing process, our vertically-integrated business model, our financial viability, and the sustainability of our modules and systems.
Global Markets
We have established and are continuing to develop a global business presence. Energy markets are by their nature localized, with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application. Accordingly, our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our PV solar energy solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications. The following markets represent the key markets for our PV solar modules and systems.
The Americas
Multiple markets within the United States, which accounted for 77% of our 2017 net sales, exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market, including (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas; (ii) strong demand for renewable energy generation; and (iii) abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation. The market penetration of PV solar is also impacted by certain state and federal support programs, including the current 30% federal investment tax credit, as described under “Support Programs.” We have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing, engineering, constructing, and maintaining utility-scale power plants in the United States, particularly in California and other southwestern states, and increasingly in southeastern states. Currently, our solar projects in the United States account for a majority of the advanced-stage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Systems Project Pipeline” for more information about these projects.

Asia-Pacific
Australia. Australia continues to be a promising region for PV solar energy with strong growth in 2017 that is expected to continue in 2018. This growth is being driven by an increased demand for PPAs from Australian utilities and large industrial off-takers. In recent years, we redirected our strategy in Australia away from EPC services to focus more on utility-scale project development and module sales. Moving into 2018, we expect to pursue a robust Australian development pipeline, including self-developed projects in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. In addition to this growing development pipeline, we plan to deliver modules to various third-party developers in 2018.
Japan. Japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics, which make them attractive markets for PV solar energy. In particular, Japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports. The country has also introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power as a result of previous issues with such technology. Accordingly, the Japanese government has announced a long-term goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and has provided various incentives for solar power installations. These programs are expected to maintain strong solar demand over the next several years. We are partnering with local companies to develop, construct, and operate PV solar power systems, which will further mitigate Japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power. Our sales offerings in Japan also include our solar modules and O&M services. In December 2017, we executed sales agreements for multiple projects in Japan totaling 15 MWAC, which are the first projects we developed, constructed, and sold in the country. We are also in the process of constructing a 59 MWAC project in Ishikawa prefecture, a 40 MWAC project in Miyagi prefecture, and a 19 MWAC project in Tochigi prefecture. We have secured rights to sell power for these projects under separate 20-year PPAs with local power companies.
India. There is significant potential for PV solar energy in India due to its growing energy needs, substantial population centers, lack of electrification to many parts of the country, high energy costs, strong irradiance, and aggressive renewable energy targets set by the government, which include increasing the country’s solar capacity to 100 GW by the year 2022. To support this initiative, several key regulations have been announced relating to ramping up renewable purchase obligations, implementing penal provisions for non-compliance with the obligations under the Indian Electricity Act, budgetary allocations for establishing a Green Transmission Corridor, and the creation of numerous solar parks in various states with dedicated transmission infrastructure to be installed by the government. In addition to these measures, the Indian government also introduced the Renewable Generation Obligations, which mandate that all thermal power generators must implement new renewable energy generation capacity to match 10% of their new thermal generation capacity. Overall, these policy and regulatory measures have been introduced to create significant and sustained demand for PV solar in India. Accordingly, we continue to sell modules and develop utility-scale PV solar projects in India to address the energy and renewable purchase obligation needs of utilities and target the open access industrial and commercial power demand.
In December 2017, we completed the sale of our 25 MWAC Polepally and 10 MWAC Mahabubnagar projects, which are the first projects we developed, constructed, and sold in India. During 2017, we also executed definitive sales agreements for our Winsol and Hindupur projects, which total 155 MWAC, and commissioned two additional projects totaling 40 MWAC in Karnataka, for which we have secured rights to sell power under separate 25-year PPAs to the state owned electricity distribution companies. We continue to maintain our strong module presence in India with over 1.8 GWDC of installed modules.
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
Europe. Historically, PV solar energy adoption in Europe was driven to a large degree by feed-in-tariffs (“FiTs”) and other incentive programs in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain. However, PV solar energy in the region is transitioning to its next phase, in which growth will be driven by the degree to which PV solar energy solutions can compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation, especially in areas with high prevailing electricity prices, strong electricity demand, and strong solar resources. In particular, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Spain are all running tenders in which utility-scale PV solar projects can bid for capacity. Such tenders and other recent market developments indicate the potential for significant growth in the demand for PV solar energy. We continue 
 7

to pursue module sales activities in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Turkey and are actively evaluating additional sales opportunities in other markets where we are collaborating with certain local partners for the distribution of our modules or select project development opportunities.
The Middle East. The market potential for solar energy in the Middle East continues to be driven by a combination of strong economic fundamentals, aggressive tariff pricing, abundant solar resources, and robust policy. The United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan have established utility-scale solar programs, which are at varying degrees of maturity. The UAE and Jordan lead the region with policy mechanisms designed to ramp up the amount of renewable energy in their generation portfolios. Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait are also promising markets with indicators of future potential for solar energy. While there are several motives for investing in solar energy, including energy security, diversification of generation portfolios, and the minimization of domestic consumption of hydrocarbons, the common factor is that the economics of PV solar energy have made it a compelling energy generation source. Since establishing a presence in the Middle East in 2013, we have approximately 300 MWDC of installed modules across the region.
Africa. Africa offers strong potential for PV solar energy, which can play a useful role in meeting the region’s diversified energy needs. As the overall African market matures, the engagement of experienced project developers and support from international lenders are expected to further the adoption and growth of utility-scale PV solar energy solutions. Our primary focus in Africa is the sale of modules for utility-scale projects. Additionally, we are working with our channel partners to provide various solutions to the distributed generation and commercial and industrial markets.
Support Programs
Although we compete in key markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, our net sales and profits remain subject, in the near term, to regulation and variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives, such as quotas, renewable portfolio standards, and tendering systems. In addition to these support programs, financial incentives for PV solar energy generation include tax incentives, grants, loans, rebates, and production incentives. Although we expect to become less impacted by, and less dependent on these forms of government support over time, such programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of PV solar power systems around the world.
In Europe, renewable energy targets, in conjunction with tenders for utility-scale PV solar and other support measures, have contributed to the growth in PV solar markets. Renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources, while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors. Various European Union (“EU”) directives on renewable energy have set targets for all EU member states in support of the goal of a 35% share of energy from renewable sources in the EU by 2030.
Tax incentive programs exist in the United States at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements. At the federal level, investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s. In 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the 30% federal energy investment tax credit (“ITC”) for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019. The credit will step down to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and remain at 10% permanently beginning in 2022. The ITC has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the United States, and its extension is expected to contribute to greater medium-term demand visibility in the United States. The positive impact of the ITC depends to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing, and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing. The eventual step-down of the ITC to 10% underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity (“LCOE”), meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life, of solar systems to continue to decline and remain competitive with other sources of energy generation.

In October 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous U.S. presidential administration’s Clean Power Plan (the “Rule”), which establishes standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities. Accordingly, there is significant uncertainty regarding what effects, if any, the Rule may have on PV solar markets. The implementation and adoption of the Rule remains subject to ongoing litigation initiated by states and other stakeholders.
The majority of states in the United States have enacted legislation adopting Renewable Portfolio Standard (“RPS”) mechanisms. Under a RPS, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible renewable resources, such as solar energy generation facilities, by a specified date. Some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies. RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s RPS, the definition of eligible renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for RPS compliance. Measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its RPS mandate, California’s RPS program is the most significant in the United States, and the California market for renewable energy has dominated the western U.S. region for the past several years. First enacted in 2002, California’s RPS statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance. Pursuant to amendments enacted by the California Legislature in 2015, the California RPS program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50% of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030. In 2017, approximately 29% of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or third-party module sales to solar power projects in California.
Various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector, including the solar energy sector, and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change. For more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other adverse public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales, thereby adversely impacting our operating results.”
Business Segments
We operate our business in two segments. Our modules segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of CdTe solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity. Third-party customers of our modules segment include integrators and operators of PV solar power systems. Our second segment is our fully integrated systems segment, through which we provide complete turn-key PV solar power systems, or solar solutions, that draw upon our capabilities, which include (i) project development, (ii) EPC services, and (iii) O&M services. We may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity. All of our systems segment products and services are for PV solar power systems, which primarily use our solar modules, and we sell such products and services to utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. Additionally, within our systems segment we may temporarily own and operate certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors.
See Note 22. “Segment and Geographical Information” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our business segments.

Modules Business
Solar Modules
Since the inception of First Solar, our flagship module has been manufactured using our advanced CdTe thin film technology. Each Series 4 module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft (60cm x 120cm) in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials. Our modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 118 watts, 114 watts, and 107 watts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our Series 4 module, which offers up to 8% more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules of equivalent efficiency rating, is compatible with advanced 1500-volt plant architectures. Our Series 4ATM module variant features anti-reflective coated glass, which further enhances energy production. Our module semiconductor structure is a single-junction polycrystalline thin film that uses CdTe as the absorption layer. CdTe has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 1-2% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules.
In November 2016, we announced plans for the introduction of our Series 6 module, which will be manufactured using similar materials and processes as our legacy module technologies that have been proven in high volume production and have been in the field for over a decade. Each Series 6 module is approximately 4ft x 6ft (123cm x 201cm) in size and is expected to have an average rated power per module of over 420 watts. We expect to begin production of our Series 6 modules in 2018.
Manufacturing Process
We manufacture our CdTe solar modules on high-throughput, integrated production lines in an automated, proprietary, and continuous process. Our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. Our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time-consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules. We currently manufacture solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia manufacturing facilities, and plan to utilize our manufacturing facility in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for the production of Series 6 modules. As we transition our manufacturing capacity to Series 6 module technology, we expect to ramp down production of our Series 4 modules over the next several years.
Our CdTe manufacturing processes includes the following three stages: (i) the deposition stage, (ii) the cell definition and treatment stage, and (iii) the assembly and test stage. In the deposition stage, panels of transparent oxide-coated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned, laser-mark identified with a serial number, heated, and coated with thin layers of CdTe and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology, after which the semiconductor-coated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength. In the cell definition and treatment stage, we use high-speed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output. In this stage, we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance, and we apply a metal sputtered back contact. Finally, in the assembly and test stage, we apply busbars, inter-layer material, and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device. A junction box, termination wires, and an under-mount frame (for Series 6 modules) are then applied to complete the assembly. The final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing.
We maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met. Acceptance testing for electrical leakage, visual quality, and power measurement on a solar simulator are also conducted prior to a module being boxed for shipment. The quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program, subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. These programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability.

Research, Development, and Engineering
Our R&D model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration, from advanced research to product development, manufacturing, and applications. We continue to devote substantial resources to our R&D efforts, which generally focus on continually improving the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules. We also focus our R&D activities on continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies, including throughput improvement, volume ramp, and material cost reduction. Based on publicly available information, we lead all PV solar module manufacturers in R&D investment, maintaining a rate of innovation that enables rapid efficiency gains and cost reductions.
In the course of our R&D activities, we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules. We primarily conduct our R&D activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our Perrysburg, Ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines. We believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines. In addition, our CdTe production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and, as a result, a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines.
We regularly produce research cells in our laboratories, some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions. Our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability. Our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years. We currently hold two world records for CdTe PV efficiency, achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 22.1% and a full area module efficiency of 18.2%. We believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential long-term module efficiency entitlement of over 20% using our commercial-scale manufacturing equipment. For information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations.”
Customers
During 2017, we sold the majority of our solar modules (not included in our systems projects) to integrators and operators of systems in the United States, India, and Turkey, and such third-party module sales represented approximately 27% of our total net sales. During 2017, Zorlu Enerji and RCR O’Donnell Griffin Pty, Ltd each accounted for more than 10% of our modules business net sales.
We continue to invest in key geographic markets, particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base. We also collaborate with strategic partners in community solar solutions, which address the residential and small business sectors to provide a broad range of customers with access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops. Community solar utilizes relatively small ground-mounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities, which then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource. The demand for such offerings continues to build as states across the country are beginning to enact community solar policies, and utilities are looking to diversify their energy generation portfolio in order to meet customer demand for affordable, clean energy. We also collaborate with providers of Community Choice Aggregation programs, which allow cities and counties to purchase power on behalf of residents and businesses to provide clean energy options at competitive prices. Our expertise in utility-scale generation and module technology, paired with community solar and/or Community Choice Aggregation, allows residential power consumers to “go solar,” including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels.

The solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry. We face intense competition for sales of solar modules, which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced average selling prices and loss of market share. With respect to our modules business, our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers, as well as other thin film solar module manufacturers. In addition, we expect to compete with future entrants into the PV solar industry that offer new technological solutions. We also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce PV solar cells, solar modules, or turn-key production lines. We also compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies (including wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and tidal technologies), as well as traditional energy generation sources.
Certain of our existing or future competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. Among PV solar module manufacturers, the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt, conversion efficiency, energy yield, reliability, warranty terms, and customer payment terms. If competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing, which could adversely affect our results of operations. For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense, and could remain that way for an extended period of time. An increased global supply of PV modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global PV module supply exceeds demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Raw Materials
Our CdTe module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module. One critical raw material in our production process is CdTe. Of the other raw materials and components, the following are also critical to our manufacturing process: front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide, other semiconductor materials, organics such as photo resist, tempered back glass, frames, packaging components such as interlayer, cord plate/cord plate cap, lead wire, and solar connectors. Before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process, a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process. We continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying new suppliers and materials. When possible, we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations, reducing the cost and lead times for such materials. Several of our key raw materials and components are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers.
Solar Module Collection and Recycling Program
We are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle. As part of such efforts, we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program. Our module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials, including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material, for use in new modules or other products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives. Approximately 90% of each collected First Solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse. For customer sales contracts that include modules covered under this program, we agree to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules, and the end-users agree to notify us, disassemble their solar power systems, package the solar modules for shipment, and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives. We currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the United States and Malaysia and at our former manufacturing facility location in Germany.
 12

The EU’s Waste Electronics and Electrical Equipment (“WEEE”) directive places the obligation of recycling (including collection, treatment, and environmentally sound disposal) of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers, and such directive is applicable to PV solar modules in EU member states. For modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the EU, we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program. Additionally, as a result of the transposition of the WEEE directive by the EU member states, we have adjusted our offerings, as required, in various EU member states to ensure compliance with specific EU member state WEEE regulations.
Solar Module Warranties
We provide a limited PV solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years. We also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by 0.5% every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25-year performance warranty period. As an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we also offer an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. This system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. For additional information on our solar module warranty programs, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Problems with product quality or performance, including our Series 4 modules and Series 6 modules, may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected warranty and related expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.”
Systems Business
Project Development
Project development activities generally include (i) site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site, (ii) obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies, (iii) executing an interconnection agreement, (iv) obtaining environmental and land-use permits, (v) maintaining effective site control, and (vi) entering into a PPA with an off-taker of the power to be generated by the project. The sequence of such development activities varies by international location and, in certain locations, may begin by initially bidding for PPA or off-take agreements. These activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a PV solar power system. Depending on the market opportunity or geographic location, we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process, construct a system incorporating our modules, and sell the system to a long-term owner. We may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities. Depending on the type of project or geographic location, PPAs or FiT structures define the price and terms the utility or customer will pay for power produced from the project. Depending primarily on the location, stage of development upon our acquisition of the project, and/or other site attributes, the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but can be as long as five years. We may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, we may be forced to incur additional costs or impair our project assets, and the termination rights of the off-taker under the PPA may be triggered.
EPC Services
EPC services include engineering design and related services, BoS procurement, advanced development of grid integration solutions, and construction contracting and management. We provide the majority of our EPC services to our self-developed projects intended to be sold; however, we may also provide EPC services to other system owners such as utilities, independent power producers, and commercial and industrial companies. Depending on the customer and market need, we may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities.
 13

We conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the EPC agreement. For PV solar power systems we construct, we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design, installation, and BoS part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system. We may also provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments, such as irradiance, weather, module degradation, soiling, curtailment, and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality, design, or construction.
O&M Services
Our typical O&M service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a PV solar power system. We perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract. These activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with PPAs, other agreements, and regulations. Although the scope of our services may vary by contract, our O&M service arrangements generally include 24/7 system monitoring, certain PPA and other agreement compliance, NERC compliance, large generator interconnection agreement compliance, energy forecasting, performance engineering analysis, regular performance reporting, turn-key maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair, warranty management, and environmental services. As part of our O&M services, we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider, such as weather, curtailment, outages, force majeure, and other conditions that may affect system availability.
Customers
Our systems customers consist of utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners, such as investors who are looking for long-term investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns. Such customers may purchase completed systems, which include our solar modules, or any combination of development, EPC services, and/or O&M services. During 2017, the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in North America, and the principal customer of our systems business was Capital Dynamics, Inc. (“Capital Dynamics”), who accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales.
In certain markets, the emergence of utility-owned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through rate-basing utility investments. Given their long-term ownership profile, utility-owned generation customers typically seek to partner with vertically-integrated companies, such as First Solar, who can provide a broad spectrum of utility-scale generation solutions, including reliable PV solar technology, project development and construction, and O&M services, thereby mitigating their long-term ownership risks. The wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity given our utility-scale PV solar power system expertise. The demand for corporate renewables is accelerating, with corporations worldwide committing to the RE100 campaign, a collaborative, global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. We believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to customers’ sensitivity to the bankability and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations. With our strong development experience, financial strength, and global footprint, we are well positioned to meet their needs. For example, we recently completed the sale of our California Flats project in Monterey County, California, from which Apple Inc. will purchase electricity from 130 MWAC of the project under a 25-year PPA.
Competition
With respect to our systems business, we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions, including developers of PV solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects, such as wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and tidal projects. To the extent other solar module manufacturers become more 
 14

vertically integrated, we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well. We also face competition from other EPC companies and joint venture type arrangements between EPC companies and solar companies. Certain current or potential future competitors may have a low cost of capital and/or access to foreign capital. The decline in module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar energy worldwide, and there are limited barriers to entry in certain parts of the PV solar value chain, depending on the geographic market. Accordingly, competition at the system level can be intense, thereby exerting downward pressure on system-level average selling prices industry-wide. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Competition at the system level can be intense, thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on system-level profit margins industry-wide, which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations.”
Research, Development, and Engineering
Our systems related R&D activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the LCOE of a PV solar power system through reductions in BoS costs, improved system design, and energy yield enhancements associated with systems that use our modules. Such R&D efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid integration and reliability. We conduct our R&D activities for systems primarily in the United States. Innovations related to system design, inverters and power converters, hardware platforms and installation techniques, and know-how, among other things, can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce BoS costs, which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale PV solar power system. For information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations.”
Own and Operate
From time to time, we may temporarily own and operate, or retain interests in, certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors. The ability to do so provides certain potential benefits, including greater control over the sales process and offering a lower risk profile to project buyers. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets, including Chile, India, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region. As an owner and operator of certain U.S. systems, we may be subject to the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), as well as various other local, state, and federal regulatory bodies. For more information about risks related to owning and operating such systems, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – As an owner and operator of PV solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid, certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under U.S. federal and state law, which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth.” For more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as associate and third-party confidentiality agreements, to safeguard our intellectual property. We regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our R&D activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the United States and other countries. Our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, and any patents we may receive may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable. In addition, we have registered and/or have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for “First Solar.”
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on, among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our PV solar module manufacturing processes, including our unique materials sourcing, 
 15

involve proprietary know-how, technology, or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. Our R&D personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions, designs, and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules, technology, or business plans.
We have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters
Our operations include the use, handling, storage, transportation, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. We are subject to various national, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; occupational health and safety; and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third-party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or non-compliance with environmental permits required for our operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future. However, future developments such as the implementation of new, more stringent laws and regulations, more aggressive enforcement policies, or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.”
Corporate History
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2006. Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol FSLR since our initial public offering in November 2006.
Associates
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,100 associates (our term for full and part-time employees), including approximately 2,900 in our modules business and approximately 400 associates that work directly in our systems business. The remainder of our associates are in R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions. None of our associates are currently represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As we expand domestically and internationally, we may encounter either regional laws that mandate union representation or associates who desire union representation or a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our associates are good.
Information about Geographic Areas
We have significant manufacturing, development, construction, sales, and marketing operations both within and outside the United States. We manufacture our solar modules at our manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia and plan to also utilize our manufacturing facility in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
As part of our long-term strategic plans, we conduct business in various countries across the world, including the United States, countries in the Asia-Pacific region, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. As a result, we are subject to the legal, tax, political, social, regulatory, and economic conditions of an increasing number of foreign jurisdictions. During 2017, the foreign countries with the greatest concentration of customer risk were India and Turkey which 
 16

accounted for a total of 9% of our consolidated net sales. The international nature of our operations also subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks, including unfavorable political, regulatory, labor, and tax conditions in the United States and/or foreign countries” and “We may be unable to fully execute on our long-term strategic plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.” See Note 22. “Segment and Geographical Information” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.
