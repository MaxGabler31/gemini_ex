Acquisition and Background of Coherent, Inc.
Coherent, one of the world's leading providers of laser solutions and optics for microelectronics, life sciences, industrial manufacturing, scientific and aerospace and defense markets, was acquired by II-VI on July 1, 2022. In fiscal year 2023, Coherent's operations will be included in the combined company, to be rebranded Coherent Corp., as the Lasers Segment. Except as otherwise indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, information about II-VI as of June 30, 2022 or any earlier date, or for any period ended June 30, 2022 or any earlier date, does not include any financial, operational or other information regarding Coherent.
Coherent delivers systems to the world's leading brands, innovators, and researchers, all backed with a global service and support network. Since inception in 1966, Coherent has grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes, and product offerings. Coherent serves important end markets like microelectronics, precision manufacturing, and instrumentation, as well as applications in aerospace and defense. 
The word "laser" is an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties. Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp. As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including welding and other materials processing procedures. The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications. Laser light can be monochromatic—all of the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band. Lasers can produce the lasing action in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber. Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable. Coherent manufactures all of these laser types, in various options such as continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc. Each application has its own specific requirements in terms of laser performance. 
Coherent’s key laser applications include: semiconductor wafer inspection; manufacturing of advanced printed circuit boards; flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; metal cutting and welding; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and research and development. For example, UV lasers are enabling the continuous move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets. In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.

We believe that our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by a strong culture and a good relationship between the Company and our employees. 
•Our People. Our people are critical to our continued success. We provide a workplace that develops, supports, and motivates our employees. We partner with Gallup to implement their Q12 Employee Engagement Survey. The survey questions and Gallup’s resources help us measure our progress toward creating a stronger, more engaged workforce. Based on the results, our employee teams then collaborate on action plans to improve in targeted areas. Our most recent employee engagement survey (2021) saw 94% participation from our global workforce, and the results showed that overall engagement increased by 10% from our original survey. We plan to conduct the survey again in calendar year 2023 to continue to measure and enhance employee engagement company wide. 
•Occupational Health and Safety. It is our highest priority to keep our employees, customers, and suppliers safe, as the health and safety of our workforce is paramount to the success of our business. We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. We have experienced employees on-site at each of our manufacturing locations who are tasked with environmental, health, and personal safety education and compliance. The safety calculation recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”), is closely monitored throughout the Company. As of June 30, 2022, our TRIR was 0.23, which remained static year-over-year as compared to FY21. We customize our policies to the local requirements and circumstances of each plant.
•COVID-19. Our top priority during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers, suppliers, and our communities. Our on-site work environments were changed to accommodate best-in-class protocols. The commitment to this effort is evidenced by the extensive planning and numerous actions we swiftly took to respond to the pandemic, including the development and implementation of a Pandemic Response Team and Pandemic Response Guide, a work-from-home program, health check protocols, temperature screenings, and periodic COVID-19 testing where permitted and deemed appropriate for all employees working on-site. Additionally, new process workflows were initiated to ensure reduced contact for employees working on-site, contact tracing processes and protocols were established, quarantining and testing protocols for exposure and positive tests were implemented, travel guidelines and protocols were created to ensure that employees who must travel for work can do so safely, and phased return-to-work plans and approval processes were formed to enable non-manufacturing employees to return to the office when permitted by local government regulations and deemed appropriate by II-VI leadership. We hired an infectious disease expert who specializes in COVID-19 to offer guidance to our Pandemic Response Team, managers, and site leaders. We have begun the transition back to in-person work for offices on a site-by-site basis per location where deemed safe and responsible by the CDC and safeguards continue to evolve based on the local risk level and feedback from our medical consultants.
•Talent Acquisition, Development, and Training. Hiring talented individuals and continuing to develop them are critical to our operations, and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth and performance. We have a robust succession-planning process that identifies internal candidates for development. We provide all employees the chance to learn and develop critical skills, and we strive to attract, motivate, and retain high-quality talent. We encourage all employees to broaden their knowledge. For example, to foster our culture of innovation, we host monthly Technology Spotlight Seminars to highlight some of the many significant technical advances and competencies within II-VI. These seminars cover a broad spectrum of platforms and products, with the primary objectives of fostering innovation within the company and technical community; cross-fertilizing technology and sparking new ideas for cross-business collaborations; and enhancing the visibility of II-VI’s technical capabilities, platforms, and recent advances. Tuition reimbursement and funding for growth and development is built into the annual budget to ensure that II-VI has the skilled workforce we need. Our global internship programs welcome a new talent pipeline. In FY22, II-VI pledged $1,000,000 to fund STEM educational and research programs in 2022. 
•Total Rewards. Our “One II-VI” approach to total rewards provides a competitive total compensation package that attracts, motivates, and retains high-quality talent; matches total rewards of competitors with which we compete for talent; increases transparency of rewards programs, company and segment metrics, and measurement of achievements in relation to challenging objectives; balances fixed costs (benefits and base pay) and variable costs (bonus and equity), with a substantial portion of total direct compensation tied to performance; pays for performance – base, bonus, and equity reflect both company and individual performance; and aligns with the interests of our shareholders. Globally, all non-sales employees participate in a variable incentive program measured on the operating earnings of their business segment. Similarly, sales employees are incentivized on revenue and profit-after-tax attainment. Select employees are eligible to receive equity-based awards, to align employee and shareholder interests. In addition to offering competitive and fair compensation, we also offer a compelling suite of benefits, including comprehensive health benefits to all of our employees globally. 
•Diversity and Inclusion. II-VI supports fundamental human rights – values inherent to all human beings. We expect all leaders and employees to treat each other with dignity, fairness, and respect. We are consciously expanding the diversity of our workforce with a focus on underrepresented groups in leadership and technical positions, creating growth and development opportunities for our employees, embracing different perspectives, and fostering an inclusive work environment. We have begun to incorporate inclusive leadership training topics into our leadership development programs to ensure that inclusive leadership practices are embedded into our culture. In FY22, we introduced “Building a Culture of Inclusion” into our global Front-Line Leader Program. The Company also formed a Global Advisory Council comprising senior leaders across the organization responsible for providing oversight on our DEI efforts. The program’s executive sponsors include the CEO’s direct reports and a Corporate Board Member. The Council is currently working on developing the program’s strategic pillars and tying DEI objectives to the business strategy. We plan to have regional DEI strategies in place for each of our global locations. With the launch of our DEI program, Chair and CEO Chuck Mattera took a stand against racism in signing the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge, joining other CEOs dedicated to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The pledge includes a commitment to engage the board of directors when developing and evaluating DEI strategies, cultivating an environment that supports open dialogue on complex and often difficult conversations around DEI, implementing and expanding unconscious bias education and training, and sharing best practices in the area of DEI programs and initiatives.
Globally, approximately 49% of the workforce is female, with 11,519 females and 12,139 males as of June 30, 2022. In the II-VI’s Senior Leadership Team (“SLT”), which consists of senior directors and above, there are 21 females and 196 males. The SLT meets quarterly to discuss strategy, business trends, company operations, financials, and people programs. Our global footprint is diverse, with approximately 18,600 employees in the Asia-Pacific region, 1,300 in Europe, and 3,800 in the Americas. 
Manufacturing Processes
Our success in developing and manufacturing many of our products depends on our ability to manufacture and tailor the optical and physical properties of technically challenging materials and components. The ability to produce, process, and refine these complex materials, and to control their quality and in-process yields, is an expertise of the Company that is critical to the performance of our customers’ subsystems and systems. In the markets we serve, there is a limited number of high-quality suppliers of many of the components we manufacture. Aside from datacenter transceivers, there are very few industry-standard products.
Our network of worldwide manufacturing sites allows us to manufacture our products in regions that provide cost-effective and risk-management advantages. We employ numerous advanced manufacturing technologies and systems at our manufacturing facilities. These include metal-organic chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy reactors, automated computer numeric control optical fabrication, high-throughput thin-film coaters, nanoprecision metrology, and custom-engineered automated furnace controls for crystal growth processes. Manufacturing products for use across the electromagnetic spectrum requires the capability to repeatedly manufacture products with high yields to atomic tolerances. II-VI continuously updates its comprehensive quality management systems that feature manufacturing quality best practices. II-VI is committed to delivering products within specification, on time, and with high quality, with a goal of fully satisfying customers and continually improving.
We continue to focus our efforts to convert locations to renewable energy. During the past two fiscal years, we have converted 40 of our sites to renewable-electricity contracts. In addition, II-VI participates in Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, and all of our Apple production facilities are powered with 100% renewable energy. 
Additionally, our Fremont, California, and Dallas, Texas, facilities are multiyear award recipients for continued compliance with local wastewater treatment programs. Additional information can be found on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) section of our website at www.ii-vi.com. The website address is intended to be an inactive textual reference only. None of the information on, or accessible through, II-VI's website is part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or is incorporated by reference herein.
Sources of Supply
In our production processes, we use numerous optical, electrical, and mechanical parts that are sourced from third-party suppliers. These include integrated circuits, mechanical housings, and optical components, and we commonly refer to them as raw materials.
The continued high quality of and access to these raw materials are critical to the stability and predictability of our manufacturing yields. We specify and test these raw materials at the onset of and throughout the production process. Additional research and capital investment are sometimes needed to better define future raw materials specifications. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced some production delays due to shortages of raw materials, and we are driving the development of strategic second sources as part of our overall business continuity planning. We do occasionally experience problems associated with vendor-supplied raw materials not meeting contract specifications for quality or purity. Risks associated with reliance on third parties for the timely and reliable delivery of raw materials is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Units
The Company’s organizational structure historically has been divided into two reporting segments for the purpose of making operational decisions and assessing financial performance: (i) Photonic Solutions and (ii) Compound Semiconductors. With the acquisition of Coherent on July 1, 2022 the Company added a third reporting segment "Lasers", which is comprised of nearly all of the business of Coherent. In addition, the Company renamed its existing two reporting segments from Photonics Solutions to Networking and from Compound Semiconductors to Materials. Beginning with fiscal year 2023, the Company is divided into three reporting segments: (i) Materials, (ii) Networking, and (iii) Lasers. The Company will report financial information for these new reporting segments in fiscal 2023.
The Photonic Solutions Segment leverages II-VI’s compound semiconductor technology platforms and deep knowledge of end-user applications for our key end markets to deliver differentiated components and subsystems.
The Compound Semiconductors Segment is a market leader in engineered materials and optoelectronic devices such as those based on GaAs, InP, GaN, and SiC. We may from time to time reorganize parts of a given segment or corporate center to drive the focus of certain priorities.

Communications Market
II-VI’s optical communications and wireless products and technologies enable next-generation high-speed optical transmission systems, networks, and datacenter solutions necessary to meet the accelerating global bandwidth demand. 
Demand for our products is largely driven by the continually growing need for additional network bandwidth created by the ongoing proliferation of data and video traffic from video conferencing for work, school, and leisure; video downloads and streaming; live TV; social networking; online gaming; file sharing; enterprise IP/internet traffic; cloud computing; and datacenter virtualization that must be handled by both wireline and wireless networks. This traffic increase reflects the recent shift to the work-from-home and study-from-home approach, which was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic but is expected to continue. Mobile traffic is increasing as a result of the proliferation of smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices.
We are a global technology leader in optical communications, providing materials, subcomponents, components, modules, and subsystems to optical component and module manufacturers, networking equipment manufacturers, datacenter operators, and telecom service providers. We design products that meet the increasing demands for network bandwidth and data storage. 
Our optical communications products can be divided into two main groups, optical transmission and optical transport.
Our optical transmission products consist primarily of transmitters, receivers, transceivers, transponders, and active optical cables, which provide the fundamental optical-electrical, or optoelectronic, interface for interconnecting the electronic equipment used in networks. This equipment includes switches, routers, and servers used in wireline networks, as well as antennas and base stations used in wireless networks. These products rely on advanced components such as semiconductor lasers and photodetectors, in conjunction with integrated circuits and novel optoelectronic packaging to provide a cost-effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber-optic cable at speeds ranging from less than 1 Gbps to more than 400 Gbps, over distances of less than 10 meters to more than 5,000 kilometers, using a wide range of network protocols and physical configurations.
Our optical transport products are at the core of both terrestrial and undersea optical networks. Our market-leading 980 nm pump lasers are the key enablers of our erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, which boost the power of optical signals in fiber-optic cables at intervals spanning 80 kilometers, typically, to allow high-speed signals to be transmitted over longer distances. Our latest generation of components for coherent transceivers is critical to a new generation of small-size, long-reach DWDM transmission modules operating from 100 Gbps to 1 Tbps and beyond.
Customers continue to rely on us for our industry-leading optical amplification and embedded monitoring solutions for their next-generation ROADM systems to compensate for inherent signal loss and to monitor signal integrity. Our proprietary OTDR modules allow systems to automatically detect and pinpoint issues along the transmission path in real time. Together with our OCM solutions, which monitor the optical power of the channels transmitted in a fiber-optic link, they enable real-time intelligence to perform preventive maintenance so as to preserve data transmission. In addition, we offer a portfolio of WSS products, which we also incorporate into ROADM line cards and subsystems.
Our proven experience in both transmission and transport allows us to effectively address the emerging DCI market. Our transceivers, submodules, pluggable amplifiers, and configurable line cards are able to meet the requirements of low power consumption, compactness, ease of installation and operation, and cost savings, which are often mandatory features in the DCI market.
The accelerating adoption of applications such as cloud computing is driving the rapid growth of datacenter buildouts. Our high-speed VCSELs enable transceivers for intra-datacenter communication. Our miniature WDM thin-film filter assemblies are used to increase the bandwidth within 100 GbE transceivers by combining wavelengths at the transmitter end and separating them out at the receiver end.
In the mobile wireless market, II-VI is a global leader in the strategic supply chain for materials and devices utilized in the latest 4G and 5G base station infrastructure. The deployment of 5G wireless is accelerating globally, driving the demand for RF power amplifiers that can operate efficiently in new high-frequency bands and be manufactured on a technology platform that can scale to meet the growing demand. GaN-on-SiC RF power amplifiers have superior performance, compared with devices based on silicon, over a wide spectrum of 5G operating frequencies in the gigahertz range, including in the millimeter-wave bands.
We are a market leader in the technology development and large-volume manufacturing of 100 mm and 150 mm semi-insulating SiC substrates. These substrates are utilized by customers worldwide to manufacture GaN-on-SiC HEMT RF power amplifier devices that are embedded in remote radio heads in 4G and 5G wireless base stations. In areas of high bandwidth demand, 5G antennas with beamforming technology utilizing multiple devices per antenna are expected to be densely deployed, increasing the demand for GaN-on-SiC power amplifiers by approximately an order of magnitude or more versus 4G antennas. Looking forward, II-VI continues to advance the state of the art in SiC substrates, with a strong technology portfolio of 30 active patents using highly differentiated and proprietary manufacturing platforms and technologies including crystal growth, substrate fabrication, and polishing. Our demonstration of the world’s first prototype 200 mm semi-insulating SiC substrates will enable the RF power amplifier market to continue to scale, increasingly replacing functions performed by devices based on silicon and enabling new applications.
Leveraging this materials expertise, II-VI has invested aggressively in a world-class 150 mm compound semiconductor manufacturing platform and is developing a fully vertically integrated, 150 mm wafer fabrication capability to manufacture the state-of-the-art GaN-on-SiC HEMT devices that will enable these next-generation wireless networks.
Industrial Market
Our laser optics and solutions for the industrial market remain well-positioned. Our vertically integrated and market-leading ZnSe optics and components, due to their inherent low loss at around the 10-micron wavelength, have enabled high-power CO2 laser systems for many decades and remain critical to the steady stream of new deployments as well as to continued operation, serving as replacement optics for the installed base of CO2 lasers. II-VI continues to introduce products that address new and growing applications for low-power CO2 lasers, such as drilling and cutting plastics, textiles, leather, wood, and other organic materials, for which the CO2 laser’s 10-micron wavelength is ideally suited. CO2 lasers are also at the core of EUV lithography systems, which enable a new generation of smaller and more powerful integrated circuits.
Fiber lasers that operate at about the 1-micron wavelength in pulsed or continuous mode have taken a central role in many industrial applications, especially for metal cutting and welding along with precision machining such as marking and microdrilling. II-VI supplies a broad range of materials, components, and subsystems that enable many functions within these fiber lasers, from the laser chips that generate the input optical power to the beam delivery systems that direct the output optical power to the target. The same set of II-VI products is at the core of existing and emerging direct-diode laser systems.
II-VI’s broad portfolio of coated optics and crystal materials serves all of these growing laser markets.

Semiconductor capital equipment requires advanced materials to meet the need for tighter tolerances, enhanced thermal stability, faster wafer transfer speeds, and reduced stage settling times. Our metal-matrix composites and reaction-bonded ceramics enable these applications, thanks to their optimum combination of light weight, strength, hardness, and coefficient of thermal expansion. Our reaction-bonded SiC materials are used to manufacture wafer chucks, lightweight scanning stages, and high-temperature corrosion-resistant wafer support systems. Our cooled SiC mirrors and precision patterned reticles are used in the illumination systems of lithography tools.
Our products enable legacy Deep UV lithography equipment that is widely deployed in semiconductor fabs. In the rapidly accelerating market of Extreme UV lithography systems, CO2 lasers are used to generate extreme-ultraviolet light. These CO2 lasers and beam delivery systems leverage our broad portfolio of CO2 laser optics, CdTe modulators, and high-power damage-resistant polycrystalline CVD diamond windows to route the powerful laser beam to a tin droplet from which EUV light will emanate. Due to its very high mechanical and thermal performance characteristics, our reaction-bonded SiC is used in structural support systems that are integral to EUV lithography optics to meet critical requirements for optical system stability.
Life Sciences Market
Within the life sciences end market, II-VI focuses on analytical instrumentation that integrates light and/or thermal-management solutions. We segment this market into three application areas (biotechnology, medical laser, and scientific) and deliver targeted and unique product portfolios for each segment. II-VI vertically integrates from the component level to more complex subassemblies and even full systems. Applications within the biotechnology segment include flow cytometry, genome sequencing, PCR, molecular diagnostics, imaging, and spectroscopy, to name a few. Our broad product portfolio delivers solutions covering illumination, light management, and thermal control.

Optical components and subassemblies such as filters, lenses, flow cells, gratings, objective lenses, and patterned reticles are embedded into these instruments to manage light delivery. Our state-of-the-art thermal engines precisely control temperature and uniformity across large areas such as plate and block assemblies, even extending to reagent or sample chilling. 
Medical laser and clinical procedures are increasingly performed with systems that integrate our lasers, optics, and thermal solutions. These applications are performed at or near the patient, requiring extreme precision and often complex designs and typically reach into the NIR and IR wavelengths. Applications are varied, from laser-based treatments and surgeries to medical imaging and even point of care. II-VI’s semiconductor laser bars and stacks are used in applications such as hair and wrinkle removal. Crystals and laser cavities, along with custom-designed lens assemblies, are used for ophthalmic, dental, and dermatological surgeries. Finally, thermal components and subassemblies deliver solutions for medical-based applications such as providing heating and cooling to the human body and medical laser temperature control.
For the scientific segment, II-VI’s solutions are the building blocks of molecular spectroscopy and imaging-based platforms. These tools typically target environmental applications such as water, air, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and agricultural testing and monitoring.

Consumer Electronics Market
II-VI manufactures VCSELs, VCSEL arrays, and optical filters for the consumer electronics market. Our VCSEL products leverage our world-class 6-inch GaAs platform, combining our epitaxial wafer growth and wafer fabrication capabilities. Our VCSELs have been used in consumer products such as computer mice and mobile phones for many years. Our VCSELs are also widely deployed in datacenters and HDMI optical cables as well as in vehicle steering wheels. This expertise in VCSEL technology has been leveraged for the growing 3D sensing market. 3D sensing was the first application to drive the demand for relatively large two-dimensional VCSEL arrays. A typical design for 3D sensing requires tens or hundreds of VCSELs per chip in order to scale up the optical power required for, for example, face recognition. Therefore, 3D sensing applications created the need to scale up manufacturing to 6-inch wafer processing. Today, II-VI is one of the very few vertically integrated 6-inch VCSEL manufacturers with a proven track record in high-volume manufacturing of high-reliability, large multi-emitter VCSEL dies designed for 3D sensing. An increasing number of consumer devices are coming on the market with embedded VCSELs, including multiple smartphones and tablets, smart watches, and household robots. 
In addition to VCSELs, our products for the consumer electronics market include wafer-scale optics, diffraction gratings, thermoelectric coolers, and substrates for sensing and AR/VR applications.
Automotive Market
II-VI is a global leader in SiC substrates for power electronics that improve the energy efficiency of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. Power electronics based on SiC enable systems to achieve significantly improved power utilization and conversion efficiencies, lower operating temperatures, and reduced thermal loads.

Our thermoelectric coolers are qualified to automotive standards and enable LiDAR systems to operate with optimal performance and efficiency.
New generations of vehicles will be equipped with a greater number of sensors that can monitor a driver’s alertness and let occupants interact with the console using touch sensing or gesture recognition. In the event of a collision, sensors can help provide critical information about the position and attention of occupants to activate restraints and deploy airbags in the best possible manner. II-VI’s products enable the most advanced in-cabin control and monitoring systems for the latest applications in human-vehicle interactions. Our VCSELs are ideal for optical touch sensors integrated in dashboards or steering wheels. Our VCSEL arrays can provide infrared cabin illumination and structured light projection to enable gesture recognition.
