Item 1.  Business
Corporate Overview and Our Products
 
CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries are collectively referred to as ‘‘CUI Global’’ or “The Company.” CUI Global is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998 with its principal place of business located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. The Company is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies and businesses. The Company's operations fall into two reportable segments: Power and Electromechanical segment and Energy segment. In addition, the Company’s corporate overhead activities are included in an ‘‘Other’’ category. CUI Global has subsidiaries in 4 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
Power and Electromechanical Segment
 CUI Inc., CUI-Canada and CUI Japan - Subsidiaries
 CUI Inc. is based in Tualatin, Oregon, CUI-Canada, is based in Toronto, Canada and CUI Japan is based in Tokyo, Japan (collectively referred to as “CUI”). These three subsidiaries are providers of power supply solutions and electromechanical components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service. CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
 
The Power and Electromechanical segment aggregates its product offerings into two categories: power supply solutions - including external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and offering a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories; and components - including connectors, speakers, buzzers, and industrial control solutions including encoders and sensors. These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense.
 
Power Supply Solutions
 Our current power line consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, and dc-dc converters. This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue.
Advanced Power
 With the rapid rise in cloud computing and the “Internet of Things,” CUI is well positioned with our advanced power portfolio to address these quickly-growing markets. System complexity, energy efficiency regulations and the need for more processing power in smaller spaces has moved digital power to a mandatory technology in data communications, server and storage applications. The acquisition of certain assets and certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc. (now CUI-Canada) in 2015 allows us to address the front-end power requirements of these same systems, providing a complete power solution for our customers. In an environment where OEMs are reducing their approved vendor list, the capability to deliver a full system solution is becoming critical.
 
Virtual Power Systems and ICE®
 CUI Inc. entered into a hardware agreement with Virtual Power Systems (VPS) to be the exclusive third-party design and development provider of ICE (Intelligent Control of Energy) products enabled by the VPS patented software system. The ICE system is a revolutionary Software Defined Power® solution that combines CUI Inc.’s hardware and Virtual Power Systems’ software into a platform that increases data centers' power infrastructure utilization. CUI Inc. has an exclusive five-year agreement with VPS, which will automatically renew for an additional five years unless notice is given by either party within six months of the end of the term.
 
Components
 AMT® Encoder
 CUI Inc. has an exclusive agreement to develop, sell and distribute the AMT encoder worldwide. The AMT series modular encoder is designed with proprietary, capacitive, code-generating technology as compared to optical or magnetic encoding. This unique device allows breakthroughs in selectable resolution, shaft-adaptation and convenient mounting solutions to bring ease of installation, reduction in SKUs and economies of scale in purchasing.

• | directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels: either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributors with partnership marketing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers’ needs and develop products accordingly. We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing. Our plan is to stay with this market during our anticipated growth. We intend to expand according to our existing model. This expansion may require additional manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas.
 
Energy Segment
 Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. - Subsidiaries
 Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (Orbital-UK) is based in Stone, Staffordshire in the United Kingdom and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (Orbital North America), is based in Houston, Texas. Orbital-UK has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 30 years and is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to United Kingdom transmission companies, including: Scotia Gas Networks (SGN); Wales & West; Cadent and National Grid. Orbital North America leverages the experience of Orbital-UK in an effort to reach the North American market with the innovative solutions that Orbital-UK customers have benefited from for years.
 
The Energy segment subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Orbital Gas Systems (Orbital), have developed a portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries. Its proprietary VE® Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT® Technology. VE Technology provides a superior method of penetrating the gas flow without the associated vortex vibration, thereby making it a ‘‘stand-alone’’ product for thermal sensing (thermowells) and trace-element sampling.
 
We deal with several independent licensors for whose intellectual property we compete with other manufacturers. Rights to such intellectual property, when acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the licensor a royalty on our net sales of the item. These license agreements, in some cases, also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees to maintain technical rights and exclusivity.
 
GasPT®
 Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV GL (formerly: GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd.) (formerly: British-based Advantica, Ltd.), CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a gas quality inferential measurement device designed by DNV GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT. The Company has minimum commitments, including royalty payments, under this licensing contract.
 
The GasPT, is a low-cost solution for measuring natural gas quality. It's connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties of the gas, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z). An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
 
This innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil & Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US, ENGIE (the French energy giant), and NMi & The International Organization of Legal Metrology (‘‘OIML’’). There is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs (‘‘GC’’) that technically can be considered competition, but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT.

For example, in the case of one of Orbital's customers, an Italian gas transmission company, there are ~ 7,000 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers. Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others. Those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT Technology.
 
In addition, there are more than 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide. Each turbine is subject to variances in natural gas quality. Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPT Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with significantly cleaner emissions. Because of the delay in information from the GC’s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished. This greater efficiency has led National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, canceling orders for several GC’s and, in 2013, replacing those GC’s with GasPT devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.
 
Orbital has successfully introduced the combined GasPT analyzer and VE sample system (GasPTi) to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK. In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device successfully completed second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013. The device is in final phase testing at GE's Oil & Gas Learning Center in Nuovo Pignone, Florence, Italy.
 
On September 3, 2015, our Italian gas transmission customer issued a public tender for the installation of at least 3,300 metering devices to change the way the customer monitors its facilities and assets. After a several months bidding process, Orbital and its partner, SOCRATE were awarded the initial purchase order (400 units) under the tender. Those 400 units were delivered on-time and in-budget during 2016. A regulatory issue unrelated to the technology has delayed the next phase of the project through 2018. While the Company expects the project to resume in 2019, there can be no assurance of this. The customer is currently working with its regulatory body to implement a program that would improve its ability to more rapidly deploy the new metering solutions. The Company has confirmed that the GasPT device is still the only qualified technology for this project.
 
Bio-Methane to Grid
 In addition, Orbital has been very involved in developing a method by which bio-methane gas can be injected into the existing natural gas infrastructure without enhancement, thus remaining environmentally-friendly while maintaining a carbon neutral footprint.
 
Bio-methane gas (produced wherever organic material is decaying) can be, and is a significant source of environmentally-friendly, carbon neutral energy in the U.K. Italy produces as much as 8 billion cubic meters of bio-methane gas per year and could dramatically reduce its carbon footprint by capturing that bio-methane gas in the form of energy. The specific advantages of bio-methane as a source of energy is that it uses already-existing pipeline infrastructure to quickly and efficiently deliver energy to the end-user, who, in most cases, is already connected to the grid.
 
The problem in the U.K. and elsewhere is maintaining accurate billing after the bio-methane gas is injected into the grid. In brief, due to the method by which billing is currently done in the U.K. (and throughout much of Western Europe), bio-methane gas must be enhanced by injecting propane or some other complex carbon material to meet critical calorific value (“CV”) levels before being injected into the grid to allow the bio-methane gas to fit the CV envelope of the regional billing model.
 
Such enhancement means that the very simple, environmentally-friendly bio-methane gas is transformed into a complex carbon gas, which increases its carbon footprint. In addition, the energy used by fleets of vehicles transporting propane to the propane injectors at each bio-methane-to-grid facility further increases the carbon footprint and resulting pollution to the environment - all-in-all, a very environmentally-unfriendly, highly polluting method of delivering what would otherwise be a “green” alternative energy source.
 
 6


DNV GL, the well-respected Norwegian consulting firm, has opined that the need to enhance bio-methane gas actually makes such gas less environmentally-friendly than standard natural gas sources.
 
The question, then, is how to avoid having to enhance bio-methane gas before injecting it into the grid. The answer, simply, is to measure the quality of the gas for billing downstream from the bio-methane injection sites, so the CV does not affect the billing, which is done in a much closer proximity to the end-user; thereby, becoming much more accurate and reliable. A simplified animation of the analysis/issues can be found at a link from our www.CUIGlobal.com website (Future Billing Methodology Animation).
 
To develop such a billing methodology, DNV GL (in conjunction with Orbital) has produced a “proof-of-concept” proposal. The first portion of that proposal, an industry survey, was memorialized in the Future Billing Methodology (“FBM”) Project Consultation Report, which can also be found at the DNV GL website, which is linked to at our www.CUIGlobal.com website (FBM Project Consultation).
 
That consultation resulted in an approval by Ofgem, the U.K. regulatory authority, to move forward with field trials to “decarbonize” the U.K. energy network.  A copy of the Stage Gate Report memorializing that Ofgem approval can be found on the DNV GL website, for which a link can be found on our www.CUIGlobal.com website (FBM Stage Gate Report).
 
A comprehensive description of the field trials, including the use of Orbital’s proprietary GasPT technology to provide for quick, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective data monitoring, was published on January 11, 2018.  A copy of that report can be found at the DNV GL website, which is linked to at www.CUIGlobal.com (FBM Project Progress Report - Phase 1).
 
On April 3, 2018, the successful delivery reward criteria report covering the second phase of industry engagement for the project was published. The report provided initial thoughts from key delivery agencies on the potential impacts of implementing a future Calorific Value zone based billing framework. This report can be found at the DNV GL website, which is linked to at www.CUIGlobal.com (Successful Delivery Reward Criteria Report).
 
Finally, on December 13, 2018, the second annual progress report was published. The smart metering laboratory trials have been delayed 12 months and are now projected to be completed by December 31, 2019 and the final future billing methodology recommendation has also been delayed 12 months and is now expected to be completed by March 31, 2020. A copy of that report can be found at the DNV GL website, which is linked to at www.CUIGlobal.com (FBM Project Progress Report 2).
 
Orbital has produced an initial, formal bid for the UK project of up to £490,000,000 ($624,000,000 USD at December 31, 2018) over 15 to 20 years.  DNV GL and Ofgem, the UK regulatory agency, have both confirmed that the formal bid falls “within budget guidelines.”
 
VE Technology®
 Orbital holds exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe, VE sample system, VE thermowell and VE Technology® from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd. The agreement, which includes certain royalty commitments, gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT natural gas metering systems. The GasPT technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture. By combining the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE Technology, which can provide a gas sample from a high-pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
 
The GasPTi system can accurately provide nearly real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds. It provides this analysis at a fraction of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
 
VE Technology gives us the ability to control and produce the entire bill of materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry.

In addition, the VE Technology, combined with applicable detectors, allows us to produce trace-element detectors for such components as mercury (Hg), moisture (H20), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that are particularly effective in quickly and accurately identifying these elements. That ability has allowed us to sell a significant number of our probes into the Gorgon LNG Project in Australia, a large Northeastern LNG terminal in the US, and chemical plants throughout North America.
 
Some features of the VE Technology that set it apart from its competition are the VE fixed or retractable sampling probe with its patented helical strakes to eliminate vortex shedding and the need for wake calculations and its patented aerodynamic probe tip to actively reject particulate, minimizing the need for filtration and allowing a small bore to optimize sample transit time. In addition, the VE sample system provides a simple, optimized system to deliver a representative sample to any analyzer with no dead volume, threaded connections or components in the sample pathway. Simple concepts and decades of detailed engineering allows quick and simple customization to suit any application.
 
Anticipated Growth Strategy for Our Energy Segment
 We will continue to market our GasPT inferential natural gas monitoring device, VE technology products, and other product and integrated solutions. Our strategy includes:
 
• | For GasPT, our strategy has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales. This approach has focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. The Company will continue its efforts in those areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2018, Orbital signed a distribution agreement with internationally recognized German equipment supplier, SAMSON AG. That agreement allows the technology to be introduced in various territories wherein Orbital has no access, including, but not limited to China, Russia, various CIS countries, and throughout Asia. The agreement calls for certain minimum sales targets and will significantly broaden the customer base for GasPT, VE Technology, and the GasPTi with SAMSON utilizing their 4,000-person sales network to promote and sell GasPT in its many iterations into the large industrial category, including pharmaceuticals, glass and steel manufacturers, breweries, etc.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographic locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies, which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Orbital continues to develop new integrated solutions, promote existing technologies, and increase customer relationships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company will continue to identify opportunities to utilize the unique VE Technology beyond the existing product offering, with a focus on gas sampling, thermowells, and trace element sampling applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We signed an exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a., for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During 2016, Orbital signed a Technology and Patent License Agreement with Daily Thermetrics, a globally-respected design and manufacturing company providing process industries with precise temperature measurement instrumentation. The Agreement calls for the manufacture and sale of the patented natural gas sampling VE Technology in North America. This relationship is expected to allow Orbital to more efficiently penetrate the North American energy market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Orbital has begun marketing its BioMethane solution globally and expects to see sales of the units into North America in late 2019 or early 2020. Orbital’s engineering teams from the U.K. and the U.S. have worked together to develop a productized version of the BioMethane-to-grid units sold into the U.K. over the past few years. Orbital branded marketing material has been created and multiple sales visits, lunch and learns and trade shows have been scheduled for attendance in 2019. We expect this to be a new growth area for the North American office.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company will continue to seek new opportunities to design, manufacture, and produce innovative solutions within the Energy segment to increase customer reach, product innovation, and growth. In such an effort, during 2016, Orbital was awarded a $3.0 million project to design, manufacture, and produce innovative solutions for gas quality and volumetric metering within SGN’s (formerly: Scotia Gas Network) Great Britain gas distribution network. Orbital-UK was awarded the contract by DNV GL, a leader within the oil and gas industry. The project is part of DNV GL’s Future Billing Methodology (“FBM”) Project, which, when implemented in late-2019, could call for the deployment of literally tens-of-thousands of the Company’s proprietary GasPT analyzers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the SGN project is to optimize gas network design and network operation assumptions. This project will use a pilot trial methodology with the procurement and installation of innovative sensor technologies across pressure tiers in a gas distribution system. These technologies, combined with novel power and communications and a cloud-based data system, will be used by DNV GL to develop a prototype real-time energy demand model, a world first. Innovative technology, such as Orbital’s proprietary GasPT Technology, form the backbone of the solution coupled with custom metering designs to be used to meet the project criteria. The project produces a GasPT application which would allow the millions of residential energy consumers to have immediate, real-time access to the cost of their energy usage.
 
We continue negotiations with ENGIE, the French transmission company, for deployment of the devices to both GRTgaz (ENGIE’s pipeline subsidiary) and Elengy (ENGIE’s liquid natural gas subsidiary). ENGIE has agreed to represent the technology to other Western European, North American, and Asian entities in a partnership with Orbital.
 
In conclusion, Orbital utilizes internationally recognized distribution partners in various global markets to reach customers throughout the natural gas industry. These distribution partners are utilized to supplement and enhance our existing sales and engineering teams in the UK and USA.

The certification of compliance with ISO 9001:2008 recognizes that our policies, practices and procedures ensure consistent quality in the design services, technology and products we provide to our customers.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 We are constantly alert to potential acquisition targets, both in innovative technology and potential strategic partners. In that regard, we are repeatedly approached by inventors and others, to assess and assist in commercialization and marketing of new technologies. These contacts largely arise because of our reputation and successes as well as our recent technology product line additions including GasPT, VE and ICE. Much like our past acquisitions, there are many small, well-run electronics and gas industry companies that become available for multiple reasons. We will consider each of these potential opportunities as they arise with a careful analysis of the relevant synergies with our current business, along with the potential for increasing revenue and/or market share.
Research and Development Activities
 Research and development costs for CUI Global were approximately $2.8 million, $2.5 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally. The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of power technologies including advanced power products, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards further development of the GasPT and VE technologies. The Company expects that research and development expenses will continue during 2019 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.

For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company’s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 The industries in which the company competes are very broad. We operate a commoditized power and electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery, quality, technical support and competitive pricing to differentiate our products from competitors. The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of larger global firms. We feel that our power and electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad. We have very strong retail distribution partners that maximize our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers. We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line in order to further differentiate from our competitors. This product line ranges from a $0.02 connector to a several thousand-dollar power solution – all different products for different customers. Additionally, we utilize third-party external sales representative organizations to penetrate new customers otherwise not readily available to the company.
 
CUI is well recognized in the power supply market and has differentiated itself through technology with a foundation of legacy and product quality. As of December 31, 2018, our Power and Electromechanical segment accounted for approximately 79% of our revenues and our Energy segment accounted for approximately 21% of our revenues. We continue to add new products and technologies that will provide us the opportunity to compete outside of price and more on innovative technology and strategic partnerships.
 
From our portfolio of full-featured power supplies, we believe that we are competitive with market leaders in our space and that the market is ready for new technologies and new ideas. With the shift toward digitally-based power supplies accelerating, our strategy is to develop a true software-defined power ecosystem where the sum of the components is greater than its parts.
 
Similarly, the natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT along with our VE Technology, competes in a mature industry with established competitors. There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure. Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low-cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition. It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real-time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z). This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and ARERA in Italy. There is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs that are technically competition, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT system.
 
Philanthropic Philosophy
 In an industry first, CUI has chosen that, in addition to sales commission, many of our sales representative firms will also receive a charity commission to be donated to charities of their choice. One of CUI’s values is generosity, which includes philanthropic giving. We give in our local community and we want to also give in the communities in which we do business.
