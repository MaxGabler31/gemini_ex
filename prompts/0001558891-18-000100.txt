Overview
 
We were incorporated on May 8, 2007 in the State of Nevada. We was originally established to offer eco-friendly health and wellness products to the general public via the internet. As we had previously disclosed, on November 20, 2012, we entered into a binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with Real Aesthetic, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Real Aesthetic”), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for common stock of the Company. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the LOI was subject to the completion of the due diligence investigation of both parties, execution and delivery of documentation for the transaction, consents from the respective boards of directors of both companies and any third parties and the delivery of audited financial statements by Real Aesthetic. Subsequently, we decided not to pursue the contemplated transaction with Real Aesthetic.
 
On June 28, 2013, FINRA confirmed the 15-1 forward stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock authorized by our Board of Directors. The record date of the split was July 8, 2013. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report and the financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted for the stock split.
 
On February 16, 2016, the Registrant filed a Preliminary Information Statement on Schedule 14C for the purpose of increasing its authorized capital stock, disclosing as its reason "to facilitate our ability to raise capital in furtherance of our business plan…” We also disclosed at that time that "we have no present plans, nor have we entered into any agreements or understandings, that may require the issuance of any of the newly-authorized Common Stock....our Board of Directors and Majority Consenting Stockholder have determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and all our stockholders to have available authorized but unissued shares . . .”
 
Since February 2016, the Registrant’s Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a new wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd (“Bengio Urban”) to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel. To that end, the Registrant raised $150,000 from the sale of restricted shares to investors to fund the new real estate development operations of Bengio Urban, which has hired employees and has signed contracts with the current tenants of two buildings who have agreed to vacate the buildings so that they can be redeveloped into modern state of the art new residential buildings .  Based upon the foregoing, the Registrant no longer deems itself to be a shell company.

We believe, based upon the current real estate market in Israel, that urban renewal projects present an excellent opportunity for us to generate revenues and profits but cannot forecast when and if such revenues would be generated. The basis for our belief is that in several major Israeli cities, there is virtually no more room to grow. As a result, several municipal governments have allowed older buildings to be renovated, thereby giving their respective cities the opportunity to develop new apartments to be added to or replacing existing buildings.
 
Additionally, municipalities have express their concern that many buildings constructed before 1980 will be unable to withstand earthquakes. In Israel, very few apartment buildings are owned by a single person or entity and since the majority of apartments within buildings are privately owned, the burden to renovate buildings in order to render them safer in the event of a major earthquake primarily falls on the multiple owners of various apartment buildings and complexes. 
 
“Tama 38” is an Israeli national zoning plan whereby a contractor assumes the responsibility of renovating an apartment building. In exchange for covering all costs of renovations, securing building permits and paying requisite taxes, the contractor has is granted the right to build additional floors to the existing building and sell the apartments built on these floors. 
 
The apartment owners benefit by receiving a modernized building, strengthened against earthquakes, as well as the additional apartments added to their buildings. In some cases balconies, storage rooms, parking spaces and elevators may be added as well, further enhancing the building’s value.
 
“Pinui Binui” projects are defined as development where the residents of apartments are temporarily evacuated so that the buildings may be demolished and rebuilt.  The tenants then return to new apartments in the newly finished and renovated building.  The contractor pays all costs for demolition, construction, relocating apartment owners and renting their temporary homes during construction.  In exchange, the contractor adds new apartments in the building which are sold to generate profit.
 
As with “Tama 38,” the value of the apartments in the building is increased thereby benefitting the owners and the tenants return to a new, often larger and safer apartment in a building often with more amenities.
 
Competition
 
There are several Companies in Israel engaged in TAMA 38 however , the Company will continue to be at a significant competitor vis-a-vis the Company's competitors.
 
Regulation and Taxation
 
The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an "investment company" as an issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading of securities. While the Company does not intend to engage in such activities, the Company could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the event the Company obtains or continues to hold a minority interest in a number of development stage enterprises. The Company could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs if required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, management will continue to review the Company's activities from time to time with a view toward reducing the likelihood the Company could be classified as an "investment company."
Employees
 
The Company currently has no employees.
