UTILITY OPERATIONS
Background

Idaho Power provided electric utility service to approximately 604,000 retail customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 506,000 of these customers are residential. Idaho Power’s principal commercial and industrial customers are involved in food processing, electronics and general manufacturing, agriculture, health care, government, and education. Idaho Power also provides irrigation customers with electric utility service to operate irrigation pumps during the agricultural growing season. Idaho Power holds franchises, typically in the form of right-of-way arrangements, in 72 cities in Idaho and 7 cities in Oregon and holds certificates from the respective public utility regulatory authorities to serve all or a portion of 25 counties in Idaho and 3 counties in Oregon. Idaho Power's service area is shaded in the illustration on the following page and covers approximately 24,000 square miles with an estimated population of 1.3 million.

Idaho Power is under the jurisdiction (as to rates, service, accounting, and other general matters of utility operation) of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC), the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC), and the FERC. The IPUC and OPUC determine the rates that Idaho Power is authorized to charge to its retail customers. Idaho Power is also under the regulatory jurisdiction of the IPUC, the OPUC, and the Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC) as to the issuance of debt and equity securities. As a public utility under the Federal Power Act (FPA), Idaho Power has authority to charge market-based rates for wholesale energy sales under its FERC tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff (OATT). Additionally, the FERC has jurisdiction over Idaho Power's sales of transmission capacity and wholesale electricity, hydropower project relicensing, and system reliability, among other items. 
Regulatory Accounting
Idaho Power meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation, with the impacts of rate regulation reflected in its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expense; depreciation expense; and income tax expense. These principles sometimes result in Idaho Power recording expenses and revenues in a different period than when an unregulated enterprise would record such expenses and revenues. In these instances, the amounts are deferred or accrued as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet and recorded on the income statement when recovered or returned in rates or when otherwise directed to begin amortization by a regulator. Additionally, regulators can impose regulatory liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers that are expected to be refunded. Idaho Power records regulatory assets or liabilities if it expects the amounts will be reflected in future prices, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence.
Consistent with orders and directives of the IPUC, unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance, Idaho Power does not provide deferred income tax expense or benefit for certain income tax temporary differences and instead recognizes the tax impact currently (commonly referred to as flow-through accounting) for rate making and financial reporting. Therefore, Idaho Power's effective income tax rate is impacted as these differences arise and reverse. Idaho Power recognizes such adjustments as regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable that the amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.
Business Strategy
IDACORP is committed to its focus on competitive total returns and generating long-term value for shareholders. IDACORP’s business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as its core business, as Idaho Power's regulated utility operations are the primary driver of IDACORP's operating results. IDACORP’s strategy is focused on four areas: growing financial strength, improving Idaho Power's core business, enhancing Idaho Power’s brand, and keeping employees safe and engaged. IDACORP's board of directors has reviewed and affirmed IDACORP’s long-term strategy. In executing on these four strategic cornerstones, IDACORP seeks to balance the interests of shareowners, Idaho Power customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power is committed to working for strong, sustainable financial results by continuing to provide reliable, affordable, clean energy to its customers from diversified generation resources.
Rates and Revenues
Idaho Power generates revenue primarily through the sale of electricity to retail and wholesale customers and the provision of transmission service. The prices that the IPUC, the OPUC, and the FERC authorize Idaho Power to charge for electric power and services are critical factors in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the discussion below, for more information on Idaho Power's regulatory framework and rate regulation, see the “Regulatory Matters” section of Part II, Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and Note 3 – “Regulatory Matters” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Retail Rates: Idaho Power's rates for retail electric services are generally determined on a “cost of service” basis. Rates are designed to provide, after recovery of allowable operating expenses including depreciation on capital investments, an opportunity for Idaho Power to earn a reasonable return on investment as authorized by regulators. Idaho Power regularly evaluates the need to request changes to its retail electricity price structure to cover its operating costs and to earn a fair return on its investments. Idaho Power uses general rate cases, power cost adjustment mechanisms in Idaho and Oregon, a fixed cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism in Idaho, balancing accounts and tariff riders, and subject-specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on investment. Retail prices are generally determined through formal ratemaking proceedings that are conducted under established procedures and schedules before the issuance of a final order. Participants in these proceedings include Idaho Power, the staffs of the IPUC or OPUC, and other interested parties. The IPUC and OPUC are charged with ensuring that the prices and terms of service are fair, non-discriminatory, and provide Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred or allowable costs and expenditures and earn a reasonable return on investment. The ability to request rate changes does not, however, ensure that Idaho Power will recover all of its costs or earn a specified rate of return, or that its costs will be recovered in advance of or at the same time when the costs are incurred. 
In addition to general rate case filings, ratemaking proceedings can involve charges or credits related to specific costs, programs, or activities, as well as the recovery or refund of amounts deferred or accrued under specific authorization from the IPUC or OPUC. Deferred amounts are generally collected from, and accrued amounts are generally refunded to, retail customers through the use of base rates or supplemental tariffs. Outside of base rates, three of the most significant mechanisms for recovery of costs are the power cost adjustment mechanisms, FCA mechanism, and energy efficiency riders. For more information on these mechanisms, see Note 3 – “Regulatory Matters” and Note 4 - “Revenues” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report
Retail Energy Sales: Weather, seasonal customer demand, energy efficiency, customer generation, and economic conditions all impact the amount of electricity that Idaho Power sells as well as the costs it incurs to provide that electricity. Idaho Power's utility revenues are not earned, and associated expenses are not incurred, evenly during the year. Idaho Power’s retail energy sales typically peak during the summer irrigation and cooling season, with a lower peak during the winter heating season. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, and mild temperatures decrease sales. Availability of water and extreme temperatures during the agricultural growing season impact electricity sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Alternative methods of generation, including customer-owned solar and other forms of distributed generation, have the potential to decrease Idaho Power sales to existing customers. Also, development of new technologies and services to help energy consumers manage energy in new ways could continue to alter demand for Idaho Power's electric energy. Approximately 95 percent of Idaho Power’s retail revenue originates from customers located in Idaho, with the remainder originating from customers located in Oregon. Idaho Power’s operations, including information on energy sales, are discussed further in Part II, Item 7 - MD&A - "Results of Operations - Utility Operations.”

The table that follows presents Idaho Power’s revenues and sales volumes for the last three years, classified by customer type.

(1) The FCA mechanism is an alternative revenue program in the Idaho jurisdiction and does not represent revenue from contracts with customers as disclosed in Note 4 – “Revenues” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
(2)      The IPUC allows Idaho Power to recover a portion of the allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) on construction work in progress related to the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC) relicensing process, even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the costs have not been moved to electric plant in service. Idaho Power is collecting $8.8 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs approved for recovery are placed in service. 
Wholesale Markets: Idaho Power participates in the wholesale energy markets by purchasing power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands. Idaho Power's market activities are guided by an energy risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans. These operating plans are impacted by factors such as customer demand for power, market prices, generating costs, transmission constraints, and availability of generating resources. Some of Idaho Power's 17 hydropower generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run hydropower generation units and when to store water in reservoirs. Idaho Power at times operates these and its other generation facilities to take advantage of market opportunities. These decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales. Even in below-normal water years, there are opportunities to vary water usage to capture wholesale marketplace economic benefits, maximize generation unit efficiency, and meet peak loads. Compliance factors such as allowable reservoir stage elevation changes and flood control requirements also influence these generation dispatch decisions. Idaho Power's wholesale energy sales depend largely on the availability of generation resources above the amount necessary to serve customer loads as well as market power prices at the time when those resources are available. A reduction in either factor leads to lower wholesale energy sales.
Idaho Power also provides energy transmission services through its OATT. The OATT rate is revised each year based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files annually with the FERC in its Form 1. The FERC oversees mandatory transmission and network reliability standards, as well as power and transmission markets, including protection against market manipulation. These mandatory transmission and reliability standards were developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which have responsibility for compliance and enforcement of transmission and reliability standards.


Competition: Idaho Power's electric utility business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly. Idaho Power competes with fuel distribution companies, including natural gas providers, in serving the energy needs of customers for space heating, water heating, and appliances. Alternative methods of generation, including customer-owned solar and other forms of distributed generation, and energy efficiency measures, also have the potential to decrease Idaho Power sales to existing customers. 
Idaho Power also participates in the wholesale energy markets and in the electric transmission markets. Generally, these wholesale markets are regulated by the FERC, which requires electric utilities to transmit power to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers and make available, on a non-discriminatory basis, transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services. 
In return for agreeing to provide service to all customers within a defined service area, electric utilities are typically provided with an exclusive right to provide service in that service area. However, certain prescribed areas within Idaho Power's service area, such as municipalities or Native American Tribal reservations, may elect not to take service from Idaho Power and instead operate as a municipal electric utility or otherwise as a separate entity. In such cases, the entity would be required to purchase or otherwise obtain rights (such as by contract) to Idaho Power's distribution infrastructure within the municipal or other designated area. Idaho Power would have no responsibility for providing electric service to the municipal or separate entity, absent Idaho Power's voluntary execution of an agreement to provide that service. 
Power Supply

Overview: Idaho Power primarily relies on company-owned hydropower, coal-fired, and gas-fired generation facilities and long-term power purchase agreements to supply the energy needed to serve customers, and for sales into the wholesale markets. Market purchases and sales are used to supplement Idaho Power's generation and balance supply and demand throughout the year. Idaho Power’s generating plants and their capacities are listed in Part I, Item 2 - “Properties.”

Various external and internal factors impact power supply costs; such as, weather, load demand, economic conditions, fuel costs, and availability of generation resources. Idaho Power’s annual hydropower generation varies depending on water conditions in the Snake River Basin. Drought conditions and increased peak load demand cause a greater reliance on potentially more expensive energy sources to meet load requirements. Conversely, favorable hydropower generation conditions increase production at Idaho Power’s hydropower generating facilities and reduce the need for thermal generation and wholesale market purchased power. Economic conditions, weather, supply constraints, and governmental regulations can affect the market price of natural gas and coal, which impact fuel expense and market prices for purchased power. Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the financial impacts to Idaho Power of volatile fuel and power costs.
Idaho Power’s system is dual peaking, with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer. Idaho Power reached its highest all-time system peak demand of 3,751 megawatts (MW) on June 30, 2021. Idaho Power's highest all-time winter peak demand of 2,527 MW was last achieved on January 6, 2017. During these and other similarly heavy load periods, Idaho Power’s system is fully committed to serve load and meet required operating reserves. The table that follows shows Idaho Power’s total power supply for the last three years.

 | Power Supply | Percent of Total Generation
 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019
 | (thousands of MWh) | 
Hydropower plants | 5,382 | | 6,967 | | 8,294 | | 48 | % | 54 | % | 62 | %
Coal-fired plants | 2,981 | | 3,719 | | 3,012 | | 27 | % | 29 | % | 22 | %
Natural gas-fired plants | 2,765 | | 2,109 | | 2,114 | | 25 | % | 17 | % | 16 | %

Hydropower Generation: Idaho Power operates 17 hydropower projects located on the Snake River and its tributaries. Together, these hydropower facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of 1,799 MW and have averaged total annual generation of approximately 7.7 million MWh over the last 30 years. The amount of water available for hydropower generation depends on several factors—the amount of snowpack in the mountains upstream of Idaho Power’s hydropower facilities, upstream reservoir storage, springtime precipitation and temperatures, main river and tributary base flows, the condition of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and its spring flow impact, summertime irrigation withdrawals and returns, and upstream reservoir regulation. Idaho Power actively participates in collaborative work groups focused on water management issues in the Snake River Basin, with the goal of preserving the long-term availability of water for use at Idaho Power’s hydropower projects on the Snake River. 
In 2021, below-normal snow accumulation and drought conditions resulted in lower than average hydropower generation of 5.4 million MWh. In 2020, precipitation and snowpack were unevenly distributed across the Snake River Basin, with the Upper Snake River Basin experiencing near-normal winter snowpack but other key basins near the HCC experiencing below-normal snowpack. These snowpack conditions, coupled with strong early season irrigation demands, yielded lower inflows to Idaho Power’s hydroelectric projects and resulted in 7.0 million MWh of hydropower generation in 2020. In 2019, above-normal reservoir storage carryover from the previous year coupled with near-normal winter snowpack resulted in 8.3 million MWh of hydropower generation. During low water years, when stream flows into Idaho Power’s hydropower projects are reduced, Idaho Power’s hydropower generation is reduced, resulting in a greater reliance on other generation resources and wholesale power purchases. For 2022, Idaho Power estimates annual generation from its hydropower facilities will be between 5.5 million MWh and 7.5 million MWh. 

Idaho Power obtains licenses for its hydropower projects from the FERC, similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydropower projects on qualified waterways. The licensing process includes an extensive public review process and involves numerous natural resource and environmental agencies. The licenses last from 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity, and cost of the project. Idaho Power is actively pursuing the FERC relicensing of the HCC, its largest hydropower generation source, and American Falls, its second largest hydropower resource. Idaho Power also has Oregon licenses for the HCC under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. For further information on relicensing activities, see Part II, Item 7 – MD&A – "Regulatory Matters – Relicensing of Hydropower Projects.”
Idaho Power is subject to the provisions of the FPA as a “public utility” and as a “licensee” by virtue of its hydropower operations. As a licensee under Part I of the FPA, Idaho Power and its licensed hydropower projects are subject to conditions described in the FPA and related FERC regulations. These conditions and regulations include, among other items, provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation, amortization of project investment from excess project earnings, and possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment and severance damages.

Coal-Fired Generation: Idaho Power co-owns the following coal-fired power plants in operation:
•Jim Bridger, located in Wyoming, in which Idaho Power has a one-third interest; and 
•North Valmy, located in Nevada, in which Idaho Power has a 50 percent interest.
BCC supplies coal to the Jim Bridger power plant. IERCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Idaho Power, owns a one-third interest in BCC and PacifiCorp owns a two-third interest in BCC and is the operator of the Bridger Coal Mine. The mine operates under a long-term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal through 2024. Idaho Power believes that BCC has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for at least the term of the sales agreement. Idaho Power also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through April 2022 from the Black Butte mine located near the Jim Bridger plant. This contract supplements the BCC deliveries and provides another coal supply to fuel the Jim Bridger plant. The Jim Bridger plant’s rail load-in facility and unit coal train, while limited, provides the opportunity to access other fuel supplies for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums. 
Idaho Power's 2021 Integrated Resource Plan identified a preferred resource portfolio and action plan includes the conversion from coal to natural gas of two units at the Jim Bridger plant in 2024 and an end to Idaho Power's participation in the remaining two coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger plant by the end of 2028. For more information on the 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, refer to "Resource Planning" in this Item 1 - "Business." In June 2021, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting, among other things, authorization to allow the Jim Bridger plant to be fully depreciated and recovered by end-of-year 2030. The status of Idaho Power's application is described more fully in Part II, Item 7 – MD&A – "Regulatory Matters." 

NV Energy is the operator of the North Valmy power plant. Idaho Power expects to meet 2022 and future fuel requirements through existing inventory and new or existing coal supply contracts. Idaho Power has an established process approved by the IPUC and OPUC for recovery of non-fuel costs related to Idaho Power’s plan to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the North Valmy plant. Idaho Power ended its participation in unit 1 of the North Valmy plant in December 2019, as planned, and plans to end its participation in unit 2 no later than the end of 2025. 
In October 2020, Idaho Power and co-owner Portland General Electric ceased coal-fired operations at their Boardman power plant, as planned. 
Natural Gas-fired Generation: Idaho Power owns and operates the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired combined-cycle combustion turbine power plant and the Danskin and Bennett Mountain natural gas-fired simple-cycle combustion turbine power plants. All three plants are located in Idaho. 
Idaho Power operates the Langley Gulch plant as a baseload unit and the Danskin and Bennett Mountain plants to meet peak supply needs. The plants are also used to take advantage of wholesale market opportunities. Natural gas for all facilities is purchased based on system requirements and dispatch efficiency. The natural gas is transported through the Williams-Northwest Pipeline under Idaho Power's 55,584 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day long-term gas transportation service agreements. These transportation agreements vary in contract length but generally contain the right for Idaho Power to extend the term. In addition to the long-term gas transportation service agreements, Idaho Power has entered into a long-term storage service agreement with Northwest Pipeline for 131,453 MMBtu of total storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie Storage Project. This firm storage contract expires in 2043. Idaho Power purchases and stores natural gas with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for seasonal peaks or to meet system requirements.

As of December 31, 2021, Idaho Power had approximately 10.6 million MMBtu of natural gas financially hedged for physical delivery, primarily for the operational dispatch of the Langley Gulch plant through February 2023. Idaho Power plans to manage the procurement of additional natural gas for the peaking units primarily on the daily spot market or from storage inventory as necessary to meet system requirements and fueling strategies.

Purchased Power: As described below, Idaho Power purchases power in the wholesale market as well as pursuant to long-term power purchase contracts and exchange agreements.
Wholesale Market Transactions: To supplement its self-generated power and long-term purchase arrangements, Idaho Power purchases power in the wholesale market based on economics, operating reserve margins, energy risk management policy guidelines, and unit availability. Depending on availability of excess power or generation capacity, pricing, and opportunities in the markets, Idaho Power also sells power in the wholesale markets. During 2021 and 2020, Idaho Power purchased 3.2 million MWh and 1.4 million MWh, respectively, of power through wholesale market purchases at an average cost of $40.65 per MWh and $27.91 per MWh, respectively. During 2021 and 2020, Idaho Power sold 0.6 million MWh and 1.2 million MWh of power in wholesale market sales, respectively, with an average price of $68.07 per MWh and $28.12 per MWh, respectively. 
Idaho Power has two firm multi-year wholesale purchased power contracts to address increased demand during summer months. These agreements total approximately 150 MW per hour during peak summer periods through 2024.
Long-term Power Purchase and Exchange Arrangements: In addition to its wholesale market purchases, Idaho Power has the following notable long-term power purchase contracts and energy exchange agreements:
•Telocaset Wind Power Partners, LLC - for 101 MW (nameplate generation) from the Elkhorn Valley wind project located in eastern Oregon. The contract term ends in 2027.
•USG Oregon LLC - for 22 MW (estimated average annual output) from the Neal Hot Springs Unit #1 geothermal power plant located near Vale, Oregon. The contract term ends in 2037.
•Clatskanie People's Utility - for up to 18 MW of generation from the Arrowrock hydropower project in southern Idaho in exchange for energy from Idaho Power's system or power purchased at the Mid-Columbia trading hub. The contract term ends in 2025. 
•Raft River Energy I, LLC - for up to 13 MW (estimated average annual output) from its Raft River Geothermal Power Plant Unit #1 located in southern Idaho. The contract term ends in 2033.
•Jackpot Holdings LLC - a 20-year power purchase agreement to purchase the output from a planned 120-MW solar facility, with a scheduled in-service date in late 2022. 


PURPA Qualifying Facility Energy Sales Agreements: Idaho Power purchases power from PURPA qualifying facilities as mandated by federal law. As of December 31, 2021, Idaho Power had contracts with on-line PURPA qualifying facilities with a total of 1,137 MW of nameplate generation capacity, with an additional 75 MW nameplate capacity of projects projected to be on-line through 2024. The energy sales agreements for these qualifying facilities have original contract terms ranging from one to 35 years. The expense and volume of purchases from PURPA qualifying facilities during the last three years is included in the following table: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
PURPA contracts expense (in thousands) | $ | 199,517 | | | $ | 194,380 | | $ | 187,344
MWh purchased under PURPA contracts (in thousands) | 3,040 | | | 3,087 | | | 2,983
Average cost per MWh from PURPA contracts | $ | 65.63 | | | $ | 62.97 | | $ | 62.80 

Pursuant to the requirements of PURPA, the IPUC and OPUC have each issued orders and rules regulating Idaho Power’s purchase of power from qualifying facilities that meet the requirements of PURPA. A key component of the PURPA contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements. PURPA regulations specify that a utility must pay energy prices based on the utility’s avoided costs. The IPUC and OPUC have established specific rules and regulations to calculate the avoided cost that Idaho Power is required to include in PURPA energy sales agreements under each state's jurisdiction. For PURPA energy sales agreements:

•Idaho Power is required to purchase all of the output delivered from the contracted qualifying facilities, subject to some exceptions such as adverse impacts on system reliability.
•The Idaho jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with PURPA contracts is fully recovered through base rates and the Idaho-jurisdiction power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism, and the Oregon jurisdictional portion is recovered through base rates and an Oregon power cost adjustment mechanism. Thus, the primary impact of high power purchase costs under PURPA contracts is on customer rates. 
•Oregon jurisdictional regulations have generally provided for PURPA standard contract terms of up to 20 years. 
•The IPUC requires Idaho Power to pay "published avoided cost" rates for all wind, solar, and energy storage projects that are smaller than 100 kilowatts (kW) and all other types of projects that are smaller than 10 average MWs. For PURPA qualifying facilities that exceed these size limitations, Idaho Power is required to negotiate an applicable price using an avoided cost methodology based on IPUC regulations.
•The IPUC issued an order in August 2015 that revised the standard PURPA power purchase contract term for new contracts to a 2-year term from the previously required 20-year term for qualifying facilities that exceed the size limitations for published avoided costs. 
•The OPUC requires that Idaho Power pay published avoided costs for solar PURPA qualifying facilities with a nameplate rating of 3 MW or less and all other types of projects with a nameplate rating of 10 MW or less. Idaho Power is required to negotiate an applicable price using an avoided cost methodology based on OPUC regulations. 
Participation in Western Energy Imbalance Market: Idaho Power participates in an energy imbalance market in the western United States (Western EIM) under which the participating parties enable their systems to interact for automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. 

Transmission Services

Electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generation facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers. Transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generation facilities can be located hundreds of miles away from customers. Idaho Power’s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum capability and reliability. Idaho Power’s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the Bonneville Power Administration, Avista Corporation, PacifiCorp, NorthWestern Energy, and NV Energy. These interconnections, coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of those entities, permit the interchange, purchase, and sale of power among entities in the Western Interconnection, the transmission grid covering much of western North America. Idaho Power provides wholesale transmission service for eligible transmission customers on a non-discriminatory basis. Idaho Power is a member of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the Northwest Power Pool, NorthernGrid, and the North American 

Energy Standards Board. These groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the Western Interconnection. Demand for transmission services can be affected by regional market factors, such as loads and generation of utilities in Idaho Power’s region. 
Transmission to serve Idaho Power's retail customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the IPUC and OPUC for retail rate making purposes. Idaho Power provides cost-based wholesale and retail access transmission services under the terms of a FERC approved OATT. Services under the OATT are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis such that all potential customers, including Idaho Power, have an equal opportunity to access the transmission system. As required by FERC standards of conduct, Idaho Power's transmission function is operated independently from Idaho Power's energy marketing function. 
Idaho Power is jointly working with various partners on the permitting of two significant transmission projects. The Boardman-to-Hemingway project is a proposed 300-mile, high-voltage transmission line between a station near Boardman, Oregon and the Hemingway station near Boise, Idaho. The Gateway West project is a proposed 1,000-mile, high-voltage transmission line between a station located near Douglas, Wyoming and the Hemingway station. Both projects are intended to meet future anticipated resource needs and are discussed in Part II, Item 7 – MD&A - "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Requirements" in this report. 

Resource Planning 

Integrated Resource Planning: The IPUC and OPUC require that Idaho Power prepare biennially an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP with the IPUC and OPUC in 2021 (2021 IRP). The IRP seeks to forecast Idaho Power's loads and resources for a 20-year period, analyzes potential supply-side, demand-side, and transmission resource options, and identifies potential near-term, mid-term, and long-term actions. The four primary goals of the IRP are to: 
•identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy within Idaho Power's service area throughout the 20-year planning period;
•ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost and risk, while including environmental considerations;
•give balanced treatment to supply-side and demand-side measures; and
•involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way.

During the time between IRP filings, the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the IRP allows for discussion and adjustment of the IRP as warranted. Idaho Power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan to reflect economic conditions, anticipated resource development, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements.
The load forecast assumptions Idaho Power used in its 2021 IRP are included in the table below, together with the average annual growth rate assumptions used in the prior two IRPs. The rate of load growth can impact the timing and extent of development of resources, such as new generation plants or transmission infrastructure, to serve those loads.

 | 5-Year Forecasted Annual Growth Rate | | 20-Year Forecasted Annual Growth Rate
 | Retail Sales(Billed MWh) | Annual Peak(Peak Demand) | | Retail Sales(Billed MWh) | Annual Peak(Peak Demand)
2021 IRP | 2.6% | 2.1% | | 1.4% | 1.4% 
2019 IRP | 1.3% | 1.4% | | 1.0% | 1.2% 
2017 IRP | 1.1% | 1.6% | | 0.9% | 1.4% 

Idaho Power's 2021 IRP identified a preferred resource portfolio and action plan, which included the addition of a 120-MW solar resource in late 2022, the conversion from coal to natural gas of two units at the Jim Bridger plant in 2024, the end to Idaho Power's participation in coal-fired operations at the North Valmy plant unit 2 in 2025, the completion of the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line in 2026, and an end to Idaho Power's participation in the remaining two coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger plant by the end of 2028. The 2021 IRP preferred resource portfolio and action plan also includes a need to acquire significant generation and storage resources to meet energy and capacity needs. Including the resources noted above, over the next 20 years the IRP plans for the addition of 1,685 MW of storage capacity, 1,405 MW of solar capacity, 700 MW of wind capacity, 500 MW of transmission capacity, and 400 MW of capacity from demand response. As noted in the 2021 IRP, there is uncertainty surrounding the resource sufficiency estimates and project completion dates, including uncertainty around the timing and extent of third-party development of renewable resources, fuel commodity prices, regulatory requirements, the actual completion date of the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission project, and the economics and logistics of coal-fired plant conversions and retirements. These uncertainties, as well as others, may result in changes to the desirability of the 

preferred portfolio and adjustments to the timing and nature of anticipated and actual actions in the 2021 IRP. As of the date of this report, proceedings relating to the 2021 IRP are pending at the IPUC and OPUC.
Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Programs: Idaho Power’s energy efficiency and demand response portfolio is comprised of 24 programs. The energy efficiency programs target energy savings across the entire year, while the demand response programs target system demand reduction in the summer at times of peak loads. The programs are offered to all customer segments and emphasize the wise use of energy, especially during periods of high demand. This energy and demand reduction can reduce or delay the need for new generation and transmission infrastructure. Idaho Power’s programs include:
•financial incentives for irrigation customers for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing new energy efficient systems;
•energy efficiency programs for new and existing homes including electric heating, ventilation and cooling equipment, as well as energy efficient building techniques, air duct sealing, and energy efficient lighting;
•incentives to industrial and commercial customers for acquiring energy efficient equipment, and using energy efficiency techniques for operational and management processes;
•demand response programs to reduce peak summer demand through the voluntary cycling of central air conditioners for residential customers, interruption of irrigation pumps, and reduction of commercial and industrial demand through actions taken by business owners and operators; and
•participation in the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, which supports market transformation efforts across the region.
In 2021, Idaho Power’s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately 138,000 MWh compared with 195,000 MWh in 2020. For 2021, Idaho Power had a demand response available capacity of approximately 379 MW. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, Idaho Power expended approximately $38 million, $51 million, and $49 million, respectively, on both energy efficiency and demand response programs. Funding for these programs is provided through a combination of the Idaho and Oregon energy efficiency tariff riders, base rates, and the power cost adjustment mechanisms. Energy efficiency program expenditures funded through the riders are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings.
Environmental, Social, and Governance Initiatives
Overview: IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s boards of directors, with considerable focus from the corporate governance and nominating committee, are responsible for the oversight of the companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives and are regularly informed of the goals, measures, and results of the companies' ESG and sustainability programs. Idaho Power has established an internal ESG Steering Committee co-led by two officers and composed of employees from the legal, finance, operations, investor relations, and other departments to oversee ESG activities and inform leadership and the board of directors on ESG related activities and matters it identifies as material to the company's operations. 
IDACORP and Idaho Power publicly release annual ESG reports and the most current report is located on Idaho Power’s website, together with other information on ESG issues relevant to Idaho Power, including short-, medium-, and long-term carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction targets that Idaho Power believes are aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of reducing CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2021 ESG Report incorporated elements of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting framework, as well as the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) ESG reporting template. Additionally, Idaho Power responded to the Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) annual questionnaire, providing emissions data and management plans to address risks associated with climate change. The ESG reports, CDP filing, and related website content are not incorporated by reference into this 2021 Annual Report. IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ESG initiatives include:
•establishing responsible management goals and long-term strategies related to the companies’ impact on the environment; such as 
◦the "Clean Today, Cleaner Tomorrow.®" goal to provide Idaho Power's customers with 100-percent clean energy by 2045,
◦the sustainability benefits from the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission projects, which include integrating renewable energy generation and deferring or eliminating the need for development of additional fossil-fueled resources, 
◦integrating renewable resources into Idaho Power's generation mix and identifying and investigating new generation and storage technologies; as part of this effort, Idaho Power issued requests for proposals in June 
16



2021 and December 2021 for additional energy resources, including renewables or natural gas resource convertible to hydrogen gas power, 
◦continuing various environmental stewardship programs along the Snake River, including fish habitat preservation, water temperature reduction, and fish and plant restoration,
◦wildfire mitigation planning and actions, and
◦wildlife habitat, archaeological and cultural resource, and raptor protection stewardship;
•operational excellence in providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy, including enhancing grid resiliency and reliability; 
•engaging and empowering Idaho Power’s workforce (including succession planning at all levels, employee development, leadership education, retirement planning education, and providing competitive compensation and benefits, including post-retirement benefits); 
•promoting a culture of safety, security, and inclusiveness for all employees; and 
•building strong community partnerships for healthy, sustainable economic development in Idaho Power’s service area. 
Based on shareholder engagement feedback, in 2021 Idaho Power also publicly released its EEO-1 statement to report its demographic workforce data.
Reducing Carbon Emissions Intensity: Carbon emissions intensity is a measure of the pounds of CO2 emitted per MWh of energy generated. Idaho Power tracks carbon emissions intensity to measure the impact of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions relative to growing power demand in its service area. Idaho Power has actively engaged in voluntary carbon emissions intensity reduction over the past decade with an original goal to reduce emissions 10-15 percent from the baseline year of 2005 levels. Idaho Power increased the goal to reduce carbon emission intensity by at least 15-20 percent for the period from 2010 to 2020, and exceeded this goal with an estimated average reduction of 29 percent over that period compared with 2005. In May 2020, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s boards of directors approved an increased goal to reduce carbon emission intensity by 35 percent for the period from 2021-2025 compared with 2005. In January 2022, Idaho Power posted its emissions reduction report on its website that establishes short-, medium-, and long-term targets for further CO2 reductions. This report also includes annual power generation levels and associated CO2 emissions and emissions intensity for the 2021-2040 period. The emissions reduction report is not incorporated in this 2021 Annual Report. Idaho Power has significantly reduced its CO2 emissions since the 2005 baseline year, primarily by decreasing its coal generation levels, including terminating coal generation at the North Valmy Unit 1 in 2019 and at the Boardman plant in 2020, and also by upgrading its hydropower facilities, and through its energy efficiency, demand-side management and cloud-seeding programs. Idaho Power plans to continue to reduce CO2 emissions in future years, including a targeted 79 percent reduction in annual CO2 emissions tons by 2030, compared to the 2005 baseline year.
Reduction in Coal-Fired Generation: Idaho Power monitors environmental requirements and assesses whether environmental control measures are or remain economically appropriate. In 2017 and 2018, the IPUC and OPUC approved settlement stipulations allowing accelerated depreciation and cost recovery for the North Valmy plant in connection with Idaho Power's plan to end its participation in the operation of units 1 and 2. Idaho Power ended its participation in the operation of unit 1 in December 2019, as planned, and plans to end its participation in unit 2 no later than the end of 2025. In October 2020, Idaho Power and co-owner Portland General Electric ceased coal-fired operations at their Boardman, as planned. 
In June 2021, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting, among other things, authorization to allow the Jim Bridger plant to be fully depreciated and recovered by end-of-year 2030. In September 2021, the co-owner and operator of the Jim Bridger plant submitted its integrated resource plan to the IPUC that contemplates ceasing coal-fired generation in units 1 and 2 in 2023 and converting those units to natural gas generation by 2024. The status of Idaho Power's application is described more fully in Part II, Item 7 – MD&A – "Regulatory Matters." 
As of the date of this report, Idaho Power expects to cease participation in operations of all jointly-owned coal-fired generation plants by the end of 2028. 
Climate Change Adaptation: Idaho Power believes its practice of in-depth planning and prudent preparation helps the company adapt to and address the risks of climate change. For more than 100 years, Idaho Power has adapted to changes in temperatures, water conditions, economic impacts, and regulatory requirements. In recent years, Idaho Power has proactively addressed risks associated with climate change through preventative measures. To address the physical impacts of climate change, Idaho Power conducts cloud-seeding operations, implements a wildfire mitigation plan, enhances grid resiliency and reliability, and continues to further Snake River shading and in-stream river enhancement projects. Idaho Power also plans for the social and economic impacts of climate change by furthering its carbon emissions intensity reduction goal, continuing efforts to achieve its path away from coal generation, increasing the integration of renewable energy, and enhancing outage communication efforts. 

Additionally, to plan for the potential regulatory impacts of climate change, Idaho Power emphasizes climate-related impacts in planning efforts, plans and advocates for additional transmission capacity to integrate additional renewable energy onto its system, identifies and investigates new technologies, including battery storage, and evaluates modifications to its pricing structure it believes will help ensure fair pricing for all customers. 
Environmental Regulation and Costs
Idaho Power's activities are subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the quality of the environment. Environmental regulation impacts Idaho Power’s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with environmental regulations, the modification of system operations to accommodate environmental regulations, and the cost of acquiring and complying with permits and licenses. In addition to generally applicable regulations, Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired power plants, natural gas combustion turbine power plants, and hydropower generating plants are subject to a broad range of environmental requirements, including those related to air and water quality, waste materials, and endangered species. For a more detailed discussion of these and other environmental issues, refer to Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - "Environmental Matters" in this report.
Environmental Expenditures: Idaho Power’s environmental compliance expenditures will remain significant for the foreseeable future, particularly given the volume of existing and proposed regulations at the federal level. Idaho Power estimates its environmental expenditures, based upon present environmental laws and regulations, will be as follows for the periods indicated, excluding AFUDC (in millions of dollars):

 | 2022 | | 2023-2024
Capital expenditures: | | | 
License compliance and relicensing efforts at hydropower facilities | $ | 21 | | | $ | 68
Investments in equipment and facilities at thermal plants | 10 | | | 11 | 
Total capital expenditures | $ | 31 | | | $ | 79
Operating expenses: | | | 
Operating costs for environmental facilities - hydropower | $ | 21 | | | $ | 43
Operating costs for environmental facilities - thermal | 10 | | | 21 | 
Total operations and maintenance | $ | 31 | | | $ | 64


Idaho Power anticipates that finalization, implementation, or modification of a number of federal and state rulemakings and other proceedings addressing, among other things, greenhouse gases (GHG) and endangered species could result in substantial changes in operating and compliance costs, but Idaho Power is unable to estimate those changes in costs given the uncertainty associated with existing and potential future regulations. Idaho Power expects that it would seek to recover increases in costs through the ratemaking process. Beyond increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and potential early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. 
Idaho Power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the HCC, its largest hydropower generation source. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is unable to predict the timing of issuance by the FERC of any license order or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs Idaho Power will incur in complying with any new license. However, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long- term license for the HCC, including AFUDC, are likely to range from $30 million to $40 million until issuance of the license. Subsequent to the issuance of a new license, Idaho Power expects to incur increased annual capital expenditures and operating and maintenance costs to comply with the requirements of any new license.

As of December 31, 2021, IDACORP had 1,992 full-time employees, 1,983 of whom were employed by Idaho Power and 9 of whom were employed by Ida-West. IDACORP had 7 part-time employees, 5 of whom were employed by Idaho Power. Of IDACORP's full-time employees, 53 percent have worked at the company for over 10 years as of the date of this report. All IDACORP and Idaho Power employees work in the United States. As of the date of this report, no Idaho Power employees are represented by unions.
Board and Board Committee Oversight: IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s boards of directors provide oversight for the companies’ human capital management. The companies’ management updates the full board of directors and its committees regularly on safety metrics, total rewards for employees, benefit and pension programs, succession planning and training programs, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, among other things. Each committee of the board of directors is delegated and takes on specific roles in this oversight. The compensation and human resources committee is responsible for overseeing employee compensation, benefit plans, and general labor issues. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing risk management, including compliance with the code of business conduct and physical security risks relating to employees. The corporate governance and nominating committee is responsible for overseeing risks associated with governance and social issues associated with employees as part of its ESG risk oversight function. 
Safety: Idaho Power is committed to the safety of its employees, customers, and the communities it serves. Idaho Power believes that safe, engaged, and effective employees are critical to the company’s success and that the company’s record of safety helps keep its service reliable and affordable. Idaho Power consistently ranks in the top 30 percent of all United States utilities in safety performance. Reflective of Idaho Power's focus on safety, the company’s Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) recordable injury rate was below the industry average rate during the last four years, and its safety metrics in 2021 were the strongest in the company’s history. In 2021, for example, Idaho Power's severity rate for injuries, measured by the number of lost workdays per 100 employees, decreased 84 percent, and its lost-time injury rate, measured by the number of lost time injuries divided by the number of OSHA-recordable injuries, decreased 79 percent, compared to its previous five-year averages for those rates.
In recognition of Idaho Power's safety culture and the dedication of its employees, the EEI presented the inaugural Thomas F. Farrell, II Safety Leadership and Innovation Award in the Member Company Project category to Idaho Power in January 2022. Idaho Power was selected for its approach of combining psychological safety and behavioral safety with practical application of human performance principles. The award recognizes the contributions of leadership and innovation to the advancement of safety in the energy industry. Recipients of the award are selected by a panel consisting of leadership from the labor, contractor, and academic communities; regulatory agencies; and EEI senior leadership.

During the COVID-19 public health crisis, Idaho Power implemented significant changes that it determined were in the best interest of its employees, as well as the communities in which it operates, in addition to complying with government regulations. While the nature of Idaho Power’s industry necessitated that much of its field-based workforce continue to operate in the field, Idaho Power implemented numerous measures to help ensure the safety of those employees, and the public, amidst the public health crisis. Most of Idaho Power’s non-field employees worked remotely beginning in March 2020 and many remain working remotely or under a hybrid, in-office and remote schedule as of the date of this report. For more information on Idaho Power's response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, see the “Executive Overview” section of Part II, Item 7 – MD&A.
Total Rewards: Idaho Power provides its employees with competitive pay and benefits, based in large part on salary studies and market data. Idaho Power utilizes a structured compensation schedule and regularly conducts compensation analyses that helps mitigate the potential for gender, race, or ethicity-based disparities in compensation. Beyond base salaries and incentive compensation, benefits for all full-time employees include a 401k plan with company matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, parental leave, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. Currently after five years of employment, a full-time employee vests in Idaho Power’s defined benefit pension plan. Idaho Power also ties annual employee incentive compensation to metrics based on the categories of earnings, power system reliability, and customer satisfaction reflective of broad stakeholder interests and each employee's contribution. 

Idaho Power delivers a variety of training opportunities and provides rotational assignment and continuous learning and development opportunities to all employees without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, physical or mental disability, or marital status. Idaho Power's talent development programs, overseen by a talent development team in the Human Resources department, are designed to help employees achieve their career goals, build management skills, and lead their organizations.
Idaho Power also encourages and enables its employees to support many charitable causes. This includes volunteer program engagement promoted by the company or employees. Idaho Power also has an employee-led organization called the “Employee Community Funds,” which administers charitable contributions from employees; Idaho Power matches a portion of employee donations, which supplements the company’s separate charitable contributions. 
Unity - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: One of Idaho Power’s core values as a company is “respect for all.” IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s Code of Business Conduct, available publicly on IDACORP’s website, states Idaho Power's position that employees deserve a workplace where they can be treated in a professional and respectful manner, and each of the company's employees has the responsibility to create and maintain such an environment. In furtherance of this core value, Idaho Power posts its "Our Commitment to Each Other" initiative on its website, which promotes an inclusive company environment as follows: 
At Idaho Power, we are committed to an inclusive environment where we are all valued, respected and given equal consideration for our contributions. We believe that to be successful as a company we must be able to innovate and adapt, which only happens when we seek out and value diverse backgrounds, opinions and perspectives.
