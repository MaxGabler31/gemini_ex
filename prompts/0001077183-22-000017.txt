Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “NEO”.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was identified and the disease has since spread across the world, including the United States. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak of the pandemic is materially adversely affecting the Company’s employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national, and international markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are likely to continue to be materially adversely affected, particularly if the pandemic persists for a significant amount of time.
The impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruptions have had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations, volume growth rates and test volumes in 2020 and 2021. Demand may fluctuate depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business disruption, reduced revenues and number of tests, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We have taken significant actions to protect our employees and maintain a safe environment while ensuring continuity of critical oncology testing for cancer patients. Among other actions, we have de-densified our laboratories and facilities, adjusted laboratory shifts, restricted visitors to facilities, restricted employee travel, implemented an emergency paid time off policy, provided remote work-environment training and support, and managed our supply chains. Importantly, all main laboratory facilities have remained open and there has been an uninterrupted continuity of high-quality testing services for clients. The Company’s top priority remains the health and safety of employees and continued quality and service for all clients with a focus on patient care. We believe that we are positioned to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For additional information on risk factors related to the pandemic or other risks that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We operate a network of cancer-focused testing laboratories in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our mission is to improve patient care through exceptional cancer-focused testing services. Our vision is to be the world’s leading cancer testing and information company by delivering uncompromising quality, exceptional service and innovative solutions.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company operates CAP accredited and CLIA certified laboratories in Fort Myers and Tampa, Florida; Aliso Viejo, Carlsbad and San Diego, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Houston, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Phoenix, Arizona; and CAP accredited laboratories in Cambridge, United Kingdom; Rolle, Switzerland; and Singapore. We currently offer the following types of testing services:
•Cytogenetics (“karyotype analysis”) – the study of normal and abnormal chromosomes and their relationship to disease. Cytogenetics involves analyzing the chromosome structure to identify changes from patterns seen in normal chromosomes. Cytogenetic studies are often performed to provide diagnostic, prognostic and occasionally predictive information for patients with hematological malignancies.
•Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (“FISH”) – a molecular cytogenetic technique that focuses on detecting and localizing the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences and genes on chromosomes. The technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of sequence similarity. Fluorescence microscopy is used to visualize the fluorescent probes bound to the chromosomes. FISH can be used to help identify numerous types of gene alterations, including amplifications, deletions, and translocations.
•Flow cytometry – a technique utilized to measure the characteristics of cell populations. Typically performed on liquid samples such as peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, it may also be performed on solid tissue samples 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

such as lymph nodes following additional processing steps. Cells are labeled with selective fluorescent antibodies and analyzed as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light. The properties measured in these antibodies include the relative size, relative granularity or internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. These fluorescent antibodies bind to specific cellular antigens and are used to identify abnormal and/or malignant cell populations. Flow cytometry is typically utilized in diagnosing a wide variety of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. Flow cytometry is also used to monitor patients during the course of therapy to identify extremely low levels of residual malignant cells, known as minimal residual disease (“MRD”) monitoring.
•Immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) and Digital Imaging – the process of localizing cellular proteins in tissue sections and relies on the principle of antigen-antibody binding. IHC is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancer. Specific surface membrane, cytoplasmic, or nuclear markers may be identified. IHC is also widely used to understand the distribution and localization of differentially expressed proteins. Digital imaging allows clients to visualize scanned slides and also perform quantitative analysis for certain stains. Scanned slides are received online in real time and can be previewed often a full day before the glass slides can be shipped back to clients.
•Molecular testing – a rapidly growing field which includes a broad range of laboratory techniques utilized in cancer testing. Most molecular techniques rely on the analysis of DNA and/or RNA, as well as the structure and function of genes at the molecular level. Molecular testing technologies include: liquid biopsy tests for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, all solid tumor types (pan-cancer), and certain breast cancer cases; DNA fragment length analysis; polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) analysis; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (“RT-PCR”) analysis, real-time (or quantitative) polymerase chain reaction (“qPCR”) analysis; bi-directional Sanger sequencing analysis; and next-generation sequencing (“NGS”) analysis.
•Morphologic analysis – the process of analyzing cells under the microscope by a pathologist, usually for the purpose of diagnosis. Morphologic analysis may be performed on a wide variety of samples, such as peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph node, and from other sites such as lung, breast, etc. The services provided at NeoGenomics may include primary diagnosis, in which a sample is received for processing and our pathologists provide the initial diagnosis; or may include secondary consultations, in which slides and/or tissue blocks are received from an outside institution for second opinion. In the latter setting, the expert pathologists at NeoGenomics assist our client pathologists on their most difficult and complex cases.
Reportable Segments
We have analyzed our reporting structure, the information available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and the information being used to make strategic decisions and have identified two primary types of customers: Clinical and Pharma. Our Clinical customers include community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference labs, and academic centers. Our Pharma customers include pharmaceutical companies to whom we provide testing and other services to support their research studies and clinical trials. 
In 2021, our Clinical Services segment accounted for 83% of consolidated revenue and our Pharma Services segment accounted for 17% of consolidated revenue. Please refer to Note 19. Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further financial information about these segments.
Clinical Services Segment
The clinical cancer testing services we offer to community-based pathologists are designed to be a natural extension of, and complementary to, the services that they perform within their own practices. We believe our relationship as a non-competitive partner to community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference labs, and academic centers can empower them to expand their breadth of testing to provide a menu of services that could match or exceed the level of service found in any center of excellence around the world. Community-based pathology practices and hospital pathology labs may order certain testing services on a technical component only (“TC” or “tech-only”) basis, which allows them to participate in the diagnostic process by performing the professional component (“PC”) interpretation services without having to hire laboratory technologists or purchase the sophisticated equipment needed to perform the technical component of the tests. We also support our pathology clients with interpretation and consultative services using our own specialized team of pathologists for difficult or complex cases and we provide overflow interpretation services when requested by clients.
We are is a leading provider of Molecular and NGS testing. These tests are interpreted by NeoGenomics’ team of Molecular experts and are often ordered in conjunction with other testing modalities. NGS panels are one of our fastest growing testing areas and clients can often receive a significant amount of biomarker information from very limited samples. These comprehensive panels can allow for faster treatment decisions for patients as compared to a series of single-gene molecular tests being ordered sequentially. We have one of the broadest Molecular menus in the industry and our targeted NeoTYPE 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

panels include genes relevant to a particular cancer type, as well as other complementary tests such as IHC and FISH. In addition, we offer molecular-only NGS targeted and comprehensive panels which combine DNA and RNA into a single work stream in order to report a full spectrum of genomic alterations, including mutation, fusions, copy number variations, and gene expression. This comprehensive menu means that NeoGenomics can be a “one-stop shop” for our clients who can get all of their oncology testing needs satisfied by our laboratory. This is attractive to our clients as patient samples do not need to be split and then managed across several laboratories. The acquisition of Inivata, provided us with oncology Liquid Biopsy technology capabilities. InVisionFirst®-Lung is a highly sensitive, targeted plasma-based assay for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and RaDaR™ is an industry-leading liquid biopsy assay designed to detect residual disease and recurrence in plasma samples from patients with solid tumor malignancies. We expect our Molecular laboratory and NGS capabilities to be a key growth driver in the coming years. 
In addition we directly serve oncology, dermatology and other clinician practices that prefer to have a direct relationship with a laboratory for cancer-related genetic testing services. We typically serve these types of clients with a comprehensive service offering where we perform both the technical and professional components of the tests ordered. In certain instances, larger clinician practices have begun to internalize pathology interpretation services, and our tech-only service offering allows these larger clinician practices to also participate in the diagnostic process by performing the PC interpretation services on TC testing performed by us. In these instances we will typically provide all of the more complex, molecular testing services.
Pharma Services Segment
Our Pharma Services revenue consists of the following three revenue streams:
•Clinical trials and research;
•Validation laboratory services; and
•Informatics.
Our Pharma Services segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials and research. This portion of our business often involves working with the pharmaceutical firms (“sponsors”) on study design as well as performing the required testing. Our medical team often advises the sponsor and works closely with them as specimens are received from the enrolled sites. We also work on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine patients’ response to a particular drug. As studies unfold, our clinical trials team reports the data and often provides key analysis and insights back to the sponsors.
Our Pharma Services segment provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients’ oncology programs from discovery to commercialization. In biomarker discovery, our aim is to help our customers discover the right content. We help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform for molecular screening and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data. In other pre-clinical and non-clinical work, we can use our platforms to characterize markers of interest. Moving from discovery to development, we seek to help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and, if applicable, develop a companion diagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large-scale clinical trial testing.
Whether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one, our Pharma Services team provides significant technical expertise, working closely with our customers to support each stage of clinical trial development. Each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time, dedicated project management and quality assurance oversight. We have experience in supporting submissions to the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) for companion diagnostics. Our Pharma Services strategy is focused on helping bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world-class laboratory services in oncology to key pharmaceutical companies in the industry.
We believe that we are is well positioned to service Pharma sponsors across the full continuum of the drug development process. Our Pharma Services team can work with them during the basic research and development phase as compounds come out of translational research departments as well as work with clients from Phase 1 clinical trials through Phases II and III as the sponsors work to prove the efficacy of their drugs. The laboratory biomarker tests that are developed during this process may become companion diagnostic (“CDx”) tests, that will be used on patients to determine if they could respond to a certain therapy. We are able to offer these CDx tests to the market immediately after FDA approval as part of our Day 1 readiness program. This ability helps to speed the commercialization of a drug and can enable Pharma sponsors to reach patients through our broad distribution channel in the Clinical Services segment.
We are committed to connecting patients with life-altering therapies and trials. In carrying out these commitments, we aim to provide transparency and choice to patients regarding the handling and use of their data through our Notice of Privacy Practices, and have invested in leading technologies to seek to ensure the data we maintain is secured at all times. We are continuing to develop and broaden our informatics and data-related tools to leverage our unique market position and 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

oncology expertise to help our stakeholders solve real-world problems such as identifying patients for clinical trials or providing clinical decision support tools for physicians and providers. We also offer testing and informatics tools to help health care professionals in the rapidly evolving field of precision medicine, such as Trapelo™. Trapelo™ is an end-to-end, clinical decision-support platform designed to resolve the complexities of precision oncology – from test ordering to therapy selection to navigating prior authorization. Trapelo™ helps oncologists determine which biomarkers to test and in selecting the appropriate tests from laboratory offerings, and then assists with interpreting test results to identify appropriate, evidence-based treatment options. Trapelo™ also collaborates with health plans to embed plan policy at the “point of decision” and streamline prior authorization to optimize the efficient delivery of precision care for better patient outcomes.
Markets
The medical testing laboratory market can be broken down into the following three primary markets:
•Clinical Pathology testing;
•Anatomic Pathology testing; and
•Genetic and Molecular testing.
Clinical Pathology testing covers high volume, highly automated, lower complexity tests on easily procured specimens such as blood and urine. Clinical Pathology tests often involve testing of a less urgent nature, for example, cholesterol testing and testing associated with routine physical exams.
Anatomic Pathology testing involves evaluation of tissue, as in surgical pathology, or cells as in cytopathology. The most widely performed Anatomic Pathology procedures include the preparation and interpretation of pap smears, skin biopsies, and tissue biopsies.
Genetic and Molecular testing typically involves analyzing chromosomes, genes, proteins, and/or DNA/RNA sequences for abnormalities. Genetic and molecular testing requires highly specialized equipment and credentialed individuals (typically MD or PhD level) to certify results and typically yields the highest reimbursement levels of the three market segments.
NeoGenomics operates primarily in the Genetic and Molecular testing market. We also act as a reference laboratory supplying anatomic pathology testing. NeoGenomics typically does not operate in the clinical pathology testing market.
The field of cancer genetics is evolving rapidly and new tests continue to be developed at an accelerated pace. Based on medical and scientific discoveries over the last decade, cancer testing falls into one of three categories: diagnostic testing, prognostic testing and predictive testing. Of the three, the fastest growing area is predictive testing, which is utilized by clinicians to predict a patient’s response to the various treatment options in order to deliver “personalized or precision medicine” that is optimized to that patient’s particular circumstances. Personalized or precision medicine better allows clinicians to know if a patient will or will not respond to certain cancer medications like Herceptin, Keytruda, PIQRAY, and Opdivo. This is designed to save the healthcare system money by helping to ensure that expensive cancer drugs are only given to those who will benefit from them. This type of testing improves patient care and potentially saves lives by identifying optimized therapies much more rapidly than what was possible in previous years.
The U.S. market for genetic and molecular testing is divided among numerous laboratories. Many of these laboratories are attached to academic institutions and primarily provide clinical services to their affiliated university hospitals and associated physicians.
We believe several key factors are influencing the rapid growth in the market for cancer testing: (i) every year, more and more genes and genomic pathways are implicated in the development and/or clinical course of cancer; (ii) cancer is primarily a disease of the elderly – one in four senior citizens is likely to develop some form of cancer during the rest of their lifetime once they turn sixty, and now that the baby boomer generation has started to reach this age range, the incidence rates of cancer are rising; (iii) increasingly, new drugs are being targeted to certain cancer subtypes and pathways which require companion diagnostic testing; (iv) patient and payer awareness of the value of genetic and molecular testing; (v) decreases in the cost of performing genetic and molecular testing; (vi) increased coverage from third party payers and Medicare for such testing; and (vii) the health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010. These factors have driven significant growth in the market for this type of testing. Additionally, there is an increased focus on developing tests for monitoring purposes, including MRD and recurrence detection in cancer survivors, which could also broaden the use of certain tests and influence the market for cancer testing. 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

2022 Focus Areas:
We are committed to sustainable growth while transforming patient care by being an innovative leader in our industry. Our focus for 2022 is to sustain a purpose driven culture that maintains excellence in service and performance while growing through innovation. We expect the following initiatives to allow the Company to continue on its path to become one of the world’s leading cancer testing and information companies:

•Expand development of new cancer treatments; and
•Accelerate precision medicine in the community.
Excellence in Service and Performance
•Achieve turnaround time targets;
•Grow consolidated revenue and profitability; and
•Design next-generation Laboratory Information Management System (“LIMS”) platform.
Purpose Driven Culture
•Drive an engaged and committed workforce; and
•Foster inclusive and effective leadership by expanding our culture of inclusion and developing our future leaders.
Competitive Strengths
In addition to the competitive strengths discussed below, we believe that our superior testing technologies and instrumentation, laboratory information system, client education programs and broad domestic and growing international presence also differentiates NeoGenomics from its competitors.
Turnaround Times
We strive to provide industry leading turnaround times for test results to our clients nationwide, both in the Clinical Services and Pharma Services segments. By providing information to our clients in a rapid manner, physicians can begin treating their patients as soon as possible. Our consistent timeliness of results by our Clinical Services segment is a competitive strength and a driver of additional testing requests by referring physicians. Rapid turnaround times allow for the performance of other adjunctive tests within an acceptable diagnosis window in order to augment or confirm results and more fully inform treatment options. Additionally, we believe that our rapid turnaround time on testing and our project milestones are a key differentiator in our Pharma Services segment.
Innovative Service Offerings
We believe we currently have the most extensive menu of tech-only FISH services in the country as well as extensive and advanced tech-only flow cytometry and IHC testing services. These types of testing services allow the professional interpretation component of a test to be performed and billed separately by our physician clients. Our tech-only services are designed to give pathologists the option to choose, on a case by case basis, whether they want to order just the technical information and images relating to a specific test so they can perform the professional interpretation, or order “global” services and receive a comprehensive test report which includes a NeoGenomics pathologist’s interpretation of the test results. Our clients appreciate the flexibility to access NeoGenomics’ medical staff for difficult or complex cases or when they are otherwise unavailable to perform professional interpretations. 
We offer a comprehensive suite of technical and interpretation services, to meet the needs of those clients who are not credentialed and trained in interpreting genetic tests and who require pathology specialists to interpret their testing results. In our global service offerings, our lab performs the technical component of the tests and our MDs and PhDs provide the service of interpreting the results of those tests. Our professional staff is also available for post-test consultative services. Clients using our global service offering rely on the expertise of our medical team to give them the answers they need in a timely manner to help inform their diagnoses and treatment decisions. 
We believe we have one of the broadest Molecular and NGS test menus in the world. Clients have the ability to order single gene molecular tests, targeted NeoTYPE panels that include the relevant actionable genes for a particular cancer type as well as large NGS panels. Our Pharma Services segment offers a full range of sequencing testing including whole exome and whole genome sequencing. Our menu enables us to be a true “one-stop shop” for our clients as we can meet all of their oncology testing needs.

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

National Direct Sales Force
Our direct sales force has been trained extensively in cancer genetic testing and consultative selling skills to service the needs of clients. Our sales team for the clinical cancer testing services is organized into five regions – Northeast, Southeast, North Central, South Central, and West. Our Pharma Services segment has a dedicated team of business development specialists who are experienced in working with pharma sponsors and helping them with the testing needs of their research and development projects as well as Phase I, II and III studies. These sales representatives utilize our custom Customer Relationship Management System (“CRM”) to manage their territories, and we have integrated the key customer care functionality within our Laboratory Information Services (“LIS”) into the CRM so that our sales representatives can stay informed of emerging issues and opportunities within their regions. Our in-house customer care team is aligned with our field sales team to serve the needs of our clients by utilizing the same LIS and CRM. Our field teams can see in real-time when a client calls the laboratory, the reason for the call, the resolution, and if face-to-face interaction is needed for follow-up. Our sales force educates clients on new test offerings and their proper utilization and our representatives are often seen as trusted advisors by our clients.
Seasonality
The majority of our clinical testing volume is dependent on patients being treated by hematology/oncology professionals and other healthcare providers. The volume of our testing services generally declines modestly during the summer vacation season, year-end holiday periods and other major holidays, particularly when those holidays fall during the middle of the week. In addition, the volume of our testing tends to decline due to extreme adverse weather conditions, such as excessively hot or cold spells, heavy snow, hurricanes or tornadoes in certain regions, consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period.
In our Pharma Services segment, we enter into both short-term and long-term contracts, ranging from one month to several years. While the volume of this testing is not as directly affected by seasonality as described above, the testing volume does vary based on the terms of the contract. Our volumes are often based on how quickly sponsors can get patient enrollees for their trials and seasonality can impact how quickly they can get patients enrolled. Many of our long-term contracts contain specific performance obligations where the testing is performed on a specific schedule. This results in revenue that is not consistent among periods. In addition, this results in backlog that can be significant.
Competition
For our Clinical Services segment, the genetic and molecular testing niche of the laboratory testing industry is highly competitive and, given the opportunities in this industry, we expect it to become even more competitive. Competitive factors in genetic and molecular testing generally include the reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered, pricing, convenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting, medical staff, timeliness of delivery of completed reports (i.e. turnaround times) and post-reporting follow-up for clients.
Our competitors for our Clinical Services segment in the United States are numerous and include major national medical testing laboratories, hospital laboratories and in-house physician laboratories. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and production capabilities than us. These companies may succeed in developing service offerings that are more effective than any that we have or may develop, and may also prove to be more successful than we are in marketing such services. In addition, technological advances or different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors may render our service offerings obsolete, less effective or uneconomical.
We intend to continue our efforts to gain market share by offering industry-leading turnaround times, a broad service menu, high-quality test reports, new tests including proprietary ones, enhanced post-test consultation services, and personal attention from our direct sales force. In addition, we believe our flexible reporting solutions, which enable clients to report out customized results in a secure, real-time environment, will allow us to continue to gain market share.
Our Pharma Services business competes against many other clinical research organizations and central reference laboratories. Many of these competitors are much larger and have a greater international presence than we do. Over the past few years, we have expanded our Pharma Services business into Europe and Asia at the request of our clients and we believe that our state of the art testing menu and our high level of service along with our international expansion will allow us to continue to gain market share in this segment.
Our Pharma Services segment competitors are numerous Contract Resource Organizations (“CROs”). These competitors are larger than NeoGenomics and have global operations including operations in some regions where we do not yet have service capabilities. These laboratories may be more effective than us in gaining business for global clinical trials. Many clinical reference laboratories have also entered the space in support of clinical trials and the related laboratory testing. These reference laboratories are often willing to compete with lower pricing for smaller, more limited studies. We believe our 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

strong scientific and medical team is a key differentiator where NeoGenomics is used as an advisor to the sponsors on their trials. Our extensive experience in anatomic pathology continues to result in our winning clinical trials business as sponsors trust our medical team and want them to closely oversee their trials. We believe our service focus and our leading molecular and IHC platforms, as well as our exclusive MultiOmyxTM platform will continue to lead to rapid growth in this segment.
Suppliers
We order our laboratory and research supplies from large national laboratory supply companies. While we do not depend on a concentrated, limited number of suppliers, we do rely on certain suppliers for specific reagents or other equipment, including sequencers. We have seen an increase in supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining reagents and basic laboratory supplies in 2021. While we do not believe a short-term disruption from any one of these suppliers would have a material effect on our business, it could result in short-term impact on our turnaround time or gross margin depending on the nature of or extent of the disruption.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to revenue and accounts receivable are primarily limited to certain clients to which we provide a significant volume of our services, and to specific payers of our services such as Medicare and individual insurance companies.
Dependence on Major Clients
We market our services to pathologists, oncologists, other clinicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, academic centers and other clinical laboratories throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. The Company’s client base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed clients diversified across various customer types. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, no single client accounted for more than 10% of revenue.
Payer Mix
The following table reflects our estimate of the breakdown of net clinical revenue by type of payer for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Client direct billing | 63 | % | | 63 | % | 59 | %
Commercial insurance | 19 | % | | 20 | % | 23 | %
Medicare and other government | 18 | % | | 17 | % | 18 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

All of our Pharma Services revenue is billed directly to clients or the pharmaceutical sponsor.
Insurance
We maintain professional liability and numerous other insurance policies. We believe that our present insurance is sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, but we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of the policy coverage limits. In addition, although we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so at acceptable cost.

Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,000 full-time equivalent employees and contracted pathologists.

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

World-class Medical and Scientific Team
Our team of medical professionals and PhDs are specialists in the field of genetics, oncology and pathology. As of December 31, 2021, we employed or contracted with approximately 130 MDs and PhDs. We have many nationally and world-renowned pathologists on staff, which is a key differentiator from many smaller laboratories. Our clinical customers look to our staff and their expertise and they often call our medical team on challenging cases. For our Pharma Services segment, many sponsors work with our medical team on their study design and on the interpretation of results from the studies. Our medical team is a key differentiator as we have a depth of medical expertise that many other laboratories cannot offer to pharmaceutical companies.
World-Class Culture
We promote a World-Class Culture through Employee Engagement, Training and Development, Wellness, Work-Life Balance, and Communication initiatives. Human capital management, including the recruitment and retention of a talented, diverse and highly motivated workforce, is an essential component of our strategy for long-term value creation. The Company’s active approach to human capital management values and promotes diversity, development, and equal opportunity, among many other factors. 
Our commitment to maintaining an excellent workplace includes investing in ongoing opportunities for employee development in a diverse and inclusive environment. In addition to gender and ethnic diversity and inclusion on our Board, diversity in gender and ethnicity is well-established within our workforce. As of December 31, 2021, women make up 59.0% of our global workforce, 20.0% of our workforce is in supervisory or higher positions, and of that 20.0%, 53.0% are female. With regard to the Company’s top two management tiers, 44% of our executive team and our vice presidents are women and 33.0% of our Board of Directors are women. Ethnicity is also strongly represented: 52.0% of our workforce and 11.0% of our Board of Directors are ethnically diverse. 
We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce, where all perspectives are recognized and respected, positively impacts our performance and strengthens our culture. We continuingly strive to promote a workplace in which people of diverse race, ethnicity, veteran status, marital status, socio-economic level, national origin, religious belief, physical ability, sexual orientation, age, class, political ideology, gender identity and expression participate in, contribute to, and benefit equally.
We are also committed to rewarding, supporting and developing our employees as they work toward our common purposes of saving lives by improving patient care. To that end, we offer a competitive comprehensive rewards package that includes competitive salaries, performance based bonuses, equity grants, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, family leave, paid time off, wellness programs and discounts, tuition reimbursement and an Employee Assistance Program. We also drive high levels of performance and improvement by prioritizing training and development, and we motivate and develop our employees by providing them with opportunities for advancement and offering robust onsite and remote learning opportunities for employees at every stage in their career.
Our employees’ health and safety is also important to us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took measures to support our employees, including de-densifying our laboratories and facilities, adjusting laboratory shifts, restricting visitors to facilities, restricting employee travel, implementing an emergency paid time off policy, and providing remote work-environment training and support.
Government Regulation
The laboratory industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation domestically, at the federal and state levels, and internationally. The applicable laws and regulations change frequently and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to audit, inquiry, or investigation with respect to some aspect of its operations. The failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and reimbursement guidelines could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Licensure, Accreditation, and Quality Standards
The Company operates laboratories domestically in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and California, and internationally in Switzerland, Singapore and China. The laboratories are licensed as required by the states or countries in which they are located. In addition, the laboratories in Fort Myers, Florida, Aliso Viejo and Carlsbad, California, and Nashville, Tennessee are licensed by the State of New York as the laboratories accept clinical specimens obtained in New York. All of our domestic laboratories are certified in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”). Under CLIA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) establishes various operational, personnel, facilities, administration, quality, and proficiency requirements for testing performed by a laboratory, intended to ensure testing services are accurate, valid, and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill federal and state health 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include: suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business; cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement; and significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Certain Company laboratories are also accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), including our laboratories in Switzerland and Singapore, and actively participate in CAP’s proficiency testing programs for all tests offered by the Company. CAP’s proficiency testing programs require participating laboratories to test specimens that they receive from an approved testing entity and return the results. The testing entity conducting the program analyzes the results and provides to the Company a quality control report assessing the results.
The Company has a Quality Management System that meets applicable regulatory and accreditation requirements and industry standards. The quality of care provided to clients and their patients is of paramount importance to us. We maintain quality control processes, including standard operating procedures, controls, performance measurement and reporting mechanisms. Our employees are committed to providing accurate, reliable, and consistent services. Any concerns regarding the quality of testing or services provided by the Company are quickly communicated to our Company management. We also frequently revise and improve our tests and we work with laboratory equipment vendors to ensure that our laboratory has the highest possible quality.
Compliance with licensure, accreditation, and quality standards are verified through periodic inspections by agents of relevant regulatory agencies and accrediting organizations, and we believe we are in material compliance with all licensure, accreditation, and quality requirements.
Compliance and Ethics Program
The health care industry is highly regulated and scrutinized with respect to fraud, abusive billing practices, and improper financial relationships between health care companies and their referral sources. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has published compliance program guidance, including the Compliance Program Guidance for Clinical Laboratories in August of 1998, fraud alerts, and advisory opinions. The Company has implemented a robust Compliance & Ethics Program encompassing this guidance, which is overseen by our Board of Directors, to support compliance with the myriad of international, federal, and state laws, regulations, and governmental guidance applicable to our business. Our program employs a risk-based approach to the development and implementation of standards of conduct, training and education of employees, monitoring and auditing Company practices, investigation, and response to reported or detected compliance issues. The Company provides a hotline for employees who wish to anonymously or confidentially report suspected violations of our codes of conduct, policies and procedures, or laws and regulations. Employees are strongly encouraged to report any suspected violation if they do not feel the problem can be appropriately addressed through the normal chain of command. The hotline does not replace other resources available to our employees, including supervisors, managers, and human resources staff but is an alternative channel available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The hotline forwards all reports to the Chief Compliance Officer, who is responsible for investigating, reporting to the Compliance Committee, and documenting the disposition of each report. The hotline forwards any calls pertaining to the financial statements or financial issues to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Company does not allow any retaliation against an employee who reports a compliance related issue in good faith.
The Board of Directors has a Compliance Committee that meets regularly to discuss all compliance-related issues that may affect the Company. The Company reviews its policies and procedures as new regulations and interpretations come to light to comply with applicable regulations. The Chief Compliance Officer reports quarterly to the Compliance Committee on the effectiveness of the program.
Laboratory Developed Tests
The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents, and other medical devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing. High complexity and CLIA-certified laboratories such as ours frequently develop testing procedures intended exclusively for use by the developing laboratory to provide diagnostic results to customers. These tests are referred to as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”). The regulatory framework governing LDTs is evolving, complex, and has been the subject of ongoing debate. LDTs are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA has also claimed regulatory authority over LDTs but has generally exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs offered by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories and has not subjected these tests to FDA rules and regulations governing medical devices, including premarket review requirements. In 2014, FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of enforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining the first of multiple frameworks that have been proposed for their regulation. FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer planned to finalize its 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA published a non-binding “Discussion Paper” proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft guidance, “to spur further dialogue” and give “congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution.” Recent agency announcements made in the context of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) public health emergency have produced a shifting policy landscape and further uncertainty regarding the FDA’s role in regulating LDTs: in August 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) announced that the FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement withdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to FDA’s longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs. 
Congress has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including, among other requirements, FDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (“VALID”) Act, was introduced in both the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. A competing legislative proposal, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act of 2021 (“VITAL Act”), was introduced in the Senate on May 18, 2021. However, it remains uncertain whether Congress will enact legislation regulating LDTs and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in FDA’s 2014 draft guidance or Discussion Paper, or either the VITAL or VALID Acts. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs for us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our existing tests, any modifications thereto, or any future tests we may develop. We cannot be certain as to which of our tests, if any, would require FDA approval or clearance under any of the proposed frameworks and, if required, that our tests could obtain such approval or clearance.
Laws Governing Source Relationships
The federal laws governing Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health benefits, as well as other state and federal laws, regulate certain aspects of the relationships between health care providers, including clinical laboratories, and their referral sources, including physicians, hospitals, other laboratories, and other entities. We are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), as well as similar state statutes and regulations, which prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing, or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing, or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally funded healthcare program. The federal AKS defines remuneration to include anything of value, in cash or in kind, and thus can implicate financial relationships including payments not commensurate with fair market value, such as in the form of personnel, supplies, professional, or technical services, or anything else of value. For additional information regarding the federal AKS and similar state anti-kickback laws, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risks Relating to Regulation, “The failure to comply with Anti-Kickback laws may subject us to liability, penalties or limitation of operations.”
In addition to the federal AKS, in October 2018, the U.S. Congress enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”), as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (“SUPPORT Act”). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees, payments to group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), or group practices is broader than the federal AKS. Significantly, EKRA permits the DOJ to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued.
We are also subject to international laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and contracting practices with regard to, government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and regulators are frequently using enforcement proceedings to define the scope of these laws. These laws include civil penalties for enterprises and criminal penalties and imprisonment for individuals. The obligation of the Company under these laws is to screen third parties who are hired to carry out certain services on behalf of the Company, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, and to monitor direct and indirect payments to government officials and others. Because of the broad definitions of applicability of these laws, international clients or vendors working for government-owned entities are often considered to be governmental officials. The Company has implemented a program to comply with these laws and has educates employees and its relevant vendors regularly on the requirements for vendor onboarding and conducting appropriate business interactions globally.

Physician Self-Referral Laws
The federal law referred to as the “Stark Law” prohibits payments for certain health care services, referred to as designated health services (“DHS”), which were rendered as a result of referrals by physicians to DHS entities with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have a financial relationship. A “financial relationship” includes both an ownership interest and/or a compensation arrangement with a physician, both direct and indirect, and DHS includes, but is not limited to, laboratory services.
The Stark Law prohibits an entity that receives a prohibited DHS referral from seeking payment from Medicare and Medicaid for any DHS services performed as a result of such a referral, unless an arrangement is carefully structured to satisfy every requirement of a regulatory exception. The Company endeavors to structure its financial relationships in compliance with the Stark Law and with similar state physician self-referral laws.
Many states have promulgated self-referral laws and regulations similar to the federal Stark Law, but these vary significantly based on the state. In addition to services reimbursed by Medicaid or government payers, these state laws and regulations can encompass services reimbursed by private payers and paid by self-pay patients as well. Penalties for violating state self-referral laws and regulations vary based on the state but often include civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicaid, and loss of licenses. Our financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law and similar state self-referral laws, and we rely on certain exceptions to the Stark Law with respect to such relationships. While we believe that our financial relationships with physicians and referral practices are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that government authorities would agree. If we are found to be in violation of the Stark Law or a similar state self-referral law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines, exclusion from participation in government and private payer programs, or obligations to refund amounts previously received from government payers.
The False Claims Act
The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, or to a Medicare program contractor, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, knowingly making or using a false record or statement to have a false claim paid by the government, conspiring to defraud the U.S. government, or knowingly making or using a false statement to conceal an obligation to pay the government, or improperly retaining overpayments from the government. Following enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), claims related to violations of the federal AKS and knowing retention of overpayments are also considered false claims and could lead to liability under the FCA. Further, FCA liability may lead to exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The FCA’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions are used with frequency to challenge the reimbursement practices of providers and suppliers. These provisions allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has submitted false claims for payment to the federal government. The government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and whether to prosecute the case. If it declines to do so, the individual may pursue the case alone, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. The successful qui tam relator who brought the case is entitled to a portion of the proceeds and its attorneys’ fees and costs. As most qui tam cases are filed by current or former employees, an effective compliance program, as defined by the DOJ and OIG, plays a crucial role in reducing the Company’s exposure to liability. It is also a criminal offense, under Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 287, for a person or entity to make a claim against the United States or any department or agency, knowing the claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent. The penalty is a fine and imprisonment of up to five years. The federal FCA has been an effective enforcement tool for the federal government and many states have enacted similar false claims acts as well.
The Company seeks to structure its arrangements with physicians and other clients to be in compliance with the AKS, Stark Law, state laws, and the FCA and to stay abreast of current developments and changes in the law and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain with certainty that any of our transactions will not be subject to scrutiny and, if scrutinized, will not result in sanctions or penalties. The Company has taken, and will continue to take, actions to endeavor to ensure compliance with the myriad federal and state laws that govern our business.
Medicare Payment Guidelines
We have various billing arrangements with our clients and with third party payers, including the Medicare program. When the Company bills the client for all, or a portion of, a laboratory test performed, these client billing arrangements are priced competitively at fair market value. These client billing arrangements may implicate the Medicare program’s prohibition against charging the Medicare or Medicaid programs fees substantially in excess of the Company’s usual and customary charges. Given our participation in Medicare and Medicaid, we are subject to Medicare and Medicaid regulations related to 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

billing those programs as well as agency subregulatory guidance regarding the same, the federal Stark Law, federal and state anti-kickback statutes, and the federal FCA and state equivalents.
In light of the various federal regulations and guidance from the OIG, the Company seeks to price its products competitively while endeavoring to meet applicable statutes and regulations.
Environmental Health and Safety
The Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal and state laws relating to the protection of the environment as well as human health and safety laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation, and disposal of medical specimens, hazardous materials, and infectious and hazardous waste. Company laboratories are subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and the Company generally utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations, and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the International Air Transport Association. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar laws and regulations concerning the environment and human health and safety with which the Company must also comply. The Company seeks to comply with all relevant environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations. Failure to comply could subject the Company to various administrative and/or other enforcement actions.
Confidentiality and Security of Personal Information
HIPAA contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use or disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of HHS (“OCR”), the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has published regulations to address the privacy (the “Privacy Rule”) and security (the “Security Rule”) of protected health information (“PHI”). The Company is a covered entity under HIPAA and has adopted policies and procedures to comply with HIPAA, including the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule. The health care facilities and providers that refer specimens to the Company are also bound by HIPAA. HIPAA also requires that all providers who transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and use standardized national provider identification codes. The Company has taken necessary steps to comply with HIPAA regulations, utilizes standard transaction data sets, and has obtained and implemented national provider identifiers, or NPIs, as the standard unique health identifier in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”), extends the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates for violations, establishes new requirements to notify the OCR of a breach of PHI, and allows the state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce violations of HIPAA.
In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule described above, the Company is subject to state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule regulations do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations as well as varying state privacy and security laws and regulations. These laws vary widely. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against the Company for violations of a state’s privacy laws. We believe we are in material compliance with current state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information, and we will continue to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect on January 1, 2020, and imposed privacy compliance obligations with regard to the personal information of California residents. This legislation creates significant new requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing, and deleting consumer personal information and the CCPA takes the position that consumers “own” their personal information and provides specific rights, including the right to opt out of their data being sold to a third party by the Company. The CCPA defines personal information extremely broadly as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Like the international privacy laws, this creates greater complexity in implementing a compliance program to support these requirements. This law became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020, and the Company has implemented significant mechanisms to promote compliance with this law.

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

Due to the Company’s international expansion, we are subject to a variety of international laws which serve to protect the personally identifiable information (“PII”) of individuals who reside in those countries. These laws include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), The Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (“FADP”), and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). These laws are much more complex and stringent in nature than HIPAA and are not limited to protecting patient data alone; they include employees, clients, and other individuals for which we have collected their data. Like HIPAA, these laws contain regulatory requirements for both robust data privacy and security programs and require data breach reporting should PII be used or disclosed in a manner not allowed under the laws. Penalties for violations of these laws can be significant, for instance, GDPR’s maximum penalties are up to the greater of 4.0% of a company’s annual global turnover or €20.0 million. Although the Company’s business is conducted primarily in the United States, we do receive some clinical testing from countries outside of the United States and we collect data of individuals internationally as part of the Company’s Pharma business, which obligates us to comply with these laws. We have developed privacy and security programs to meet these international obligations and continue to reassess and improve these programs continually.
