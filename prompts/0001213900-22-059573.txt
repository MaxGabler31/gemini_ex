Item 1. Description of Business. 
Overview



Datasea Inc. (“Datasea”, with its subsidiaries and VIE, as defined below, collectively, the “Company” or “We” or “Us” or “Our”) was incorporated in Nevada on September 26, 2014. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through operating entities established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily through a variable interest entity. We do not have any equity ownership of the VIE, instead the Company controls and receives the economic benefits of the VIE’s business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of our Nevada holding company that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. For a description of our corporate structure and contractual arrangements, see “Corporate Structure” on page 31 and “VIE Agreements” on page F-10. 



Datasea is a leading provider of products, services, and solutions in three converging and innovative industries: 5G messaging, acoustic intelligence and smart city to enterprise and retail customers. Datasea Inc., through its VIE, Shuhai Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shuhai Beijing”), operates in China and the VIE holds seven subsidiaries to explore the business possibilities. The company possesses proprietary and cutting-edge technologies, which build a solid foundation for Datasea to design, develop and supply one of the broadest range of solutions in each category. The vision of Datasea is to create connections that make the impossible possible, empower businesses and improve the quality of life with a sustainability focus, and aim to become a multinational company in a decade with a US operation entity as the core of its business operations.


The core of Datasea’s business strategy is to be the foremost technology solutions provider. Through technological advances, we can enable a new kind of connectivity that is affordable and available to the masses, especially in China since there are more than 48.42 million enterprises and business of all types and over 99% are SMEs. The company's revenue for the fiscal year 2022 achieved a breakthrough of increasing 9,653% in comparison with 2021. As of the date of this report, the company owns PRC registered 27 Patents and 77 Software Copyrights, including 20 patent applications pending in core technologies. The research and development of technology plays a vital role for the Company and is what makes us different. The Company has acoustic intelligence and 5G messaging application trailblazer and has visual intelligent algorithms, as well as non-visual intelligent algorithms and techniques like acoustic intelligence. By embracing artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics capability, Datasea’s intelligence takes insights, make them actionable, then creates more powerful, meaningful, and performance-enhanced products over time.



Datasea is engaged in three different business areas but with great synergies among them. Meanwhile, the Company provides a combination of software and hardware products and solutions which have the flexibility to meet with clients of different needs, but also have the abilities to serve customers at scale. 



Datasea adheres to strategic positioning of “digital economy service provider” and focus on the business direction of “digitalize and intelligentize”, “5G messaging and application” and “acoustic intelligence” and its technology capabilities to expand business coverage. China is the Company’s major market and our most revenue comes from this market, while Datasea expects to enter the international market including the United States very soon.




VIE Agreements


Shuhai Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shuhai Beijing” or the “VIE”) is the VIE. Through contractual arrangements with Shuhai Beijing, and its shareholders, Zhixin Liu, a 35% shareholder as well as the Chairman, President, CEO and Corporate Secretary of DataSea, and Fu Liu, a 65% shareholder as well as a Director of Datasea (Fu Liu is the Father of Zhixin Liu), we receive benefits from the business and lead the daily operation. Please see a condensed consolidating schedule that disaggregates the operations and depicts the financial position, cash flows, and results of operations as of the same dates and for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements in tabular form in pages F-12 to F-14 of the Annual Report.




Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement – The Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement allows Tianjin Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd (“WFOE”) to manage and operate Shuhai Beijing and collect an operating fee equal to Shuhai Beijing’s pre-tax income, per month. If Shuhai Beijing suffers a loss and as a result does not have pre-tax income, such loss shall be carried forward to the following month to offset the operating fee to be paid to WFOE if there is pre-tax income of Shuhai Beijing the following month. Furthermore, if Shuhai Beijing cannot pay off its debts, WFOE shall pay off the debt on Shuhai Beijing’s behalf. If Shuahi Beijing’s net assets fall lower than its registered capital balance, WFOE shall provide capital for Shuahi Beijing to make up for the deficit.



Under the terms of the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement, Shuhai Beijing entrusts Tianjin Information to manage its operations, manage and control its assets and financial matters, and provide intellectual property services, purchasing management services, marketing management services and inventory management services to Shuhai Beijing. Shuhai Beijing and its stockholders shall not make any decisions nor direct the activities of Shuhai Beijing without Tianjin Information’s consent.



Stockholders’ Voting Rights Entrustment Agreement – Tianjin Information has entered into a stockholders’ voting rights entrustment agreement (the “Entrustment Agreement”) under which Zhixin Liu and Fu Liu (collectively the “Shuhai Beijing Stockholders”) have vested their voting power in Shuhai Beijing to Tianjin Information or its designee(s). The Entrustment Agreement does not have an expiration date, but the parties can agree in writing to terminate the Entrustment Agreement. Zhixin Liu, is the Chairman of the Board, President, CEO of DataSea and Corporate Secretary, and Fu Liu, a Director of the DataSea (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu).

Equity Option Agreement – the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders and Tianjin Information entered into an equity option agreement (the “Option Agreement”), pursuant to which the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have granted Tianjin Information or its designee(s) the irrevocable right and option to acquire all or a portion of Shuhai Beijing Stockholders’ equity interests in Shuhai Beijing for an option price of RMB0.001 for each capital contribution of RMB1.00. Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, Tianjin Information and the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed to certain restrictive covenants to safeguard the rights of Tianjin Information under the Option Agreement. Tianjin Information agreed to pay RMB1.00 annually to Shuhai Beijing Stockholders to maintain the option rights. Tianjin Information may terminate the Option Agreement upon prior written notice. The Option Agreement is valid for a period of 10 years from the effective date and renewable at Tianjin Information’s option.
Equity Pledge Agreement – Tianjin Information and the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders entered into an equity pledge agreement on October 27, 2015 (the “Equity Pledge Agreement”). The Equity Pledge Agreement serves to guarantee the performance by Shuhai Beijing of its obligations under the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement and the Option Agreement. Pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreement, Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed to pledge all of their equity interests in Shuhai Beijing to Tianjin Information. Tianjin Information has the right to collect any and all dividends, bonuses and other forms of investment returns paid on the pledged equity interests during the pledge period. Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Pledge Agreement, the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed to certain restrictive covenants to safeguard the rights of Tianjin Information. Upon an event of default or certain other agreed events under the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement, the Option Agreement and the Equity Pledge Agreement, Tianjin Information may exercise the right to enforce the pledge. 



There are a number of uncertainties regarding the status of the rights of the Nevada holding company with respect to its contractual arrangements with the VIE, its founders and owners, including whether the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual agreements due to uncertainties under Chinese law and jurisdictional limits. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in any internet-related businesses we may explore and operate, we do not have any equity ownership of the VIE, instead we receive the economic benefits of the VIE’s business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of our Nevada holding company that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities could decline or become worthless.



We believe that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements comply with the current applicable PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that each of the contracts among the wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, the consolidated VIE and its shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations. Thus, the PRC governmental authorities may take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structure will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations.




2







Having our operations conducted by the subsidiaries and through contractual arrangements with a variable interest entity (VIE) based in China involves unique risks to investors. The VIE structure is used to allow foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits or restricts direct foreign investment in the operating entities. The VIE contractual agreement has not been tested in court. We may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law.



All of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. In addition, Contractual arrangements entered into by the subsidiary and the PRC operating affiliate may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Such scrutiny may lead to additional tax liability and fines, which would hinder our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. If the PRC government deems that the VIE Agreements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries or other laws or regulations of the PRC, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations, which may therefore materially reduce the value of our common stock. In the event that in the future a company we hold as a VIE no longer meets the definition of a VIE under applicable accounting rules, or we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary, we would not be able to consolidate line by line that entity’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes. For a detailed discussion of risks facing the Company as a result of this VIE structure, please see “Risks Related to our Corporate Structure” from page 53 to page 56 in the Annual Report.



The investor may never hold interests in the Chinese operating company.

Dividend Distribution



Shuhai Beijing receives substantially all of its revenue in RMB. Under Shuhai Beijing’s current corporate structure, to fund any cash and financing requirements Shuhai Beijing may have, Datasea may rely on dividend payments from its subsidiaries. The WFOE may receive payments from Shuhai Beijing, and then can remit payments to Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited in accordance with its registration with the Chinese authority under the “Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Relevant Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents to Engage in Financing and in Return Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Companies” and pursuant to the VIE Agreements. Then Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited may make distribution of such payments directly to Datasea as dividends thereto. Cash dividends, if any, on our shares of common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars.



Under the existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the “SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. Pursuant to the SAFE Circular 37, Shuhai Beijing is allowed to pay dividends in foreign currencies to WFOE without prior approval from the SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the PRC shall comply with certain procedures under the PRC foreign exchange regulations applicable to PRC residents only. Approval from or registration with appropriate PRC government authorities is, however, required where RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for Shuhai Beijing’s accounts with little advance notice.



Datasea is a Nevada company conducting substantially all of its operations in China through its PRC subsidiaries, the VIE and its subsidiaries established in China. Datasea may make loans to the PRC subsidiaries and VIE entities subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or may make additional capital contributions to subsidiaries and VIE entities in China.



Any loans to the subsidiaries or VIE entities in China are subject to foreign investment and are under PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations. For example, loans by us to the wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries or VIE entities in China to finance their activities must be registered with the local counterpart of SAFE. In addition, a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self-use within its business scope. The capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes: (i) directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; (ii) directly or indirectly use for investment in securities or investments other than banks’ principal-secured products unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises). On October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Convenience of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the SAFE Circular 28, which, among other things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and does not violate with the negative list on foreign investment. However, since the SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear how SAFE and competent banks will carry this out in practice. In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis.



Current PRC regulations permit WFOE to pay dividends to Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, in accordance with Article 166 of the PRC Company Law, each of the subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each such entity in China may further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits as the discretionary common reserve, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of such entities board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.



As of the date of this report, neither Shuhai Beijing nor any of Datasea’s subsidiaries have ever paid dividends, made earnings distributions, transferred cash or other assets by kind to Datasea directly or indirectly. Also Datasea has not made any distributions or paid dividends to its shareholders, including U.S. investors, as of the date of this report. We intend to keep any future earnings to re-invest in and finance the expansion of our business in China. We do not have the intentions to distribute earnings or settle amounts owed under the VIE Agreements in the near future nor do we anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid or Shuhai Beijing’s earnings will be distributed and transferred to the holding company in the foreseeable future. Under the Cayman Islands law, a Cayman Islands company may pay a dividend on its shares out of either profit or share premium amount, provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts due in the ordinary course of business. See “Summary Consolidated Financial Data”.

VIE Agreements



Information relating to our corporate history is incorporated by reference from our 2020 Annual Report under the caption “VIE Agreements.” 



Datasea relies on contractual arrangements with the consolidated VIE and its shareholders, Zhixin Liu, Chairman of the Board, President, CEO of DataSea and Corporate Secretary, and Fu Liu, a Director of the DataSea (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu), to operate our business. The contractual arrangements with respect to the VIE are not equivalent to an equity ownership in the business of the VIE.  We consolidate the VIE as a primary beneficiary through the contractual agreements between Tianjin Information, an indirect subsidiary of DataSea and Shuhai Beijing, the VIE. If the consolidated VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our recourse to the assets held by the consolidated VIE is indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings, assets under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in the consolidated VIE, including such equity interest, may be put under court custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual arrangement or ownership by the record holder of the equity interest.

All of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the U.S. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, it would be very difficult to exert effective control over the consolidated VIE, and our ability to conduct our business and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Government Regulation; Licenses



Our operations are subject to and affected by PRC laws and regulations. The primary governmental regulation regulating the Internet security equipment industry in the PRC is the Cybersecurity Law, effective June 1, 2017, which governs entities providing “critical information infrastructure.” This statute provides basic protections for Internet users, such as not selling individual’s data to other companies without the user’s permission and not knowingly distributing malware. China’s new Data Security Law took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that data processing activities must be conducted based on “data classification and hierarchical protection system” for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government.



On December 28, 2021, thirteen governmental departments of the PRC, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”), issued the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective on February 15, 2022. The Cybersecurity Review Measures provide that an online platform operator, which possesses personal information of at least one million users, must apply for a cybersecurity review by the CAC if it intends to be listed in foreign countries. Because the VIE’s current operations do not possess personal information from more than one million users at this moment, the Company does not believe that the Company is subject to the cybersecurity review by the CAC. In addition, as of the date of this report, the Company has not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by any PRC regulatory authority, nor has the Company received any inquiry, notice, or sanction related to cybersecurity review under the Cybersecurity Review Measures.



The wholly owned subsidiaries and the VIE and its subsidiaries are required to have, and each has, a business license issued by the PRC State Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterparts. In addition, major PRC regulations applicable to our products and services and the Internet security industry include Internet Security Protection Technology Measures Provision (Ministry of Public Security Order No. 82) (“Order 82”). Order 82 specifies certain security measures Internet service providers shall take to ensure Internet security. Providers of ISP connecting service and Internet-based data processing service are within the scope of Order 82. It does not call for any license or permission to any entities.



The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. Although we believe that CSRC’s approval is not required for the listing and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that relevant PRC governmental agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do.
