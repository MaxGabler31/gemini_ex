Item 1. Business.
Our Plan of Business

Major League Football, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) plans to establish, develop, and operate Major League Football (“MLFB”) as a professional Spring/Summer football League with 4 initial Franchises located in cities overlooked in large part by existing professional sports leagues and provide fans with high quality players and competition in the NFL’s off-season. Our plan is that initial teams will be located in Ohio, Virginia, Arkansas and Alabama. Our spring playing schedule avoids all competition with the NFL and colleges.  Our search committee has located multiple cities with both a passion for sports and football as well as stadium venues whose size will provide our fans an excellent viewing experience at a reasonable rental expense to MLFB. All potential venues are equipped for high quality multi-platform media transmission allowing us the broadcast all our games in multi-levels of today’s technology. We have commenced the process of leasing these venues and have acquired all the necessary football and related equipment to fully outfit our teams, including some of the latest technology for use by our coaches and players.

MLFB plans to serve as a pipeline to develop players, coaches, officials, scouts, trainers, and all other areas of the game that the NFL needs today. We will also give NFL representatives the opportunity to view our team practices, game footage, practice tapes and confer with league coaches, team officials and staff. We believe this will provide our league with recognition and demonstrate our economic model and the market’s desire for spring football.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Subsequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread and various state and local governments have issued or extended “shelter-in-place” orders, which have impacted and restricted various aspects of the Company’s operations. The spread of the pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of an unknown magnitude and duration. Management studied in depth the possibility of having a Demonstration Season in the summer of 2021 as a means of introducing MLFB as a league and overcoming some of the difficulties encountered because of COVID-19.  While the pandemic has gradually eased and crowd capacities increased, this occurred too late in the process to commence a Demonstration Season.

MLFB has recently hired several well-known and experienced employees, coaches, scouts, and trainers as well as individuals looking to improve their skills in these areas. We believe this will provide MLFB with the recognition and credibility to demonstrate the viability of our economic model as well as the market’s desire for spring/summer football. The Company recently announced the cities of Mobile, Alabama, Little Rock, Arkansas, Canton, Ohio and Virginia Beach, Virginia as home markets for its inaugural season which will begin August 9, 2022. Additionally, the Company has executed leases with these cities.  The Company plans to have several games this summer/fall that allows the Company to build towards a full football season in the Spring of 2023, providing MLFB as America’s home for professional spring football.

The Alliance of American Football (“AAF”), whose equipment we acquired, has ceased operations and the XFL, which played five games in 2020 before filing for bankruptcy re-organization, has announced plans to restart in 2023. The Spring League is not considered a football league, but rather a development football structure as the players pay its ownership to play in it, hoping for NFL or other teams’ recognition. We believe because the Spring League has no player payroll costs, quality players will jump at a chance to be paid a salary in MLFB.  The USFL returned and played in 2022 after a 37-year hiatus with an eight-team two division league structure. The top two teams from each division played in the semifinals on the weekend of June 25, with the USFL Championship Game taking place on Sunday, July 3.

The AAF, XFL and USFL have validated MLFB’s concept that there was a demand for football in the spring/summer. We believe that there are thousands of quality football players available to MLFB and the NFL releases over 1,000 players every September. We believe that the lack of financial success by the AAF and perhaps the XFL is directly attributable to excessive payroll, stadium, and other overhead related expenses and not the concept itself. MLFB will serve as a pipeline to further develop players skills, on and off the field, as well as a training ground for young coaches, officials and all associated with the industry. NFL Europe did just this during its existence.

We require short-term financing as well as financing over the next 12 months and we have been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, short-term financing, with the intention of securing larger, more permanent financing facilities.  Effective February 8, 2022, the Company’s Form 1-A Regulation A Offering Statement was qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the sale of up to 125,000,000 shares of our $0.001 par value common stock at $0.021 per share or up to $2,6250,000 of gross proceeds.  There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that must be sold in the offering and the net proceeds from this offering are being utilized to assist in funding our planned summer 2022 football season including equipment purchases and stadium deposits, general and administrative expenses and provide working capital for the Company. Effective July 18, 2022, the Company reduced the offering price for a  portion of the shares offered going forward from $0.021 per share to $0.0168 per share.

Through the date of this Form 10-K, the Company had received $1,747,300 of gross proceeds from the sale of 86,180,949 shares of our $0.001 par value common stock.  Included in the above amount are $40,000 of gross proceeds from the sale of 1,904,761 shares of our common stock that have not been processed by the transfer agent due to technical document issues. In the event we do not obtain the entire offering amount, we may attempt to obtain additional funds through private offerings of our securities or by borrowing funds.

Additionally, Effective May 6, 2022, the Company signed an Equity Line Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) whereby subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company will sell to the Investor up to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or Four Hundred Million (400,000,000) shares of registered common stock, $0.001 par value per share.

Subject to the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Investor, by its delivery to the Investor of a Purchase Notice from time to time, to purchase a minimum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and up to a maximum of; (i) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), or (ii) one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the average daily volume traded for the Company’s common stock during the relevant Valuation Period (subject to adjustments for stock splits, dividends, and similar occurrences), subject to the Available Amount.  The Valuation Period is the ten (10) consecutive Business Days immediately preceding, but not including the date a Purchase Notice is delivered.  The maturity date of the Agreement is November 6, 2022.

The Purchase Price is 75% of the lowest traded price of the Common Stock during the Valuation Period. Following an up-list of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market or an equivalent national exchange, the Purchase Price shall be set at eighty percent (80%) of the lowest traded price of the Company’s Common Stock during the Valuation Period, subject to a floor of $0.01, per share (subject to adjustments for stock splits, dividends, and similar occurrences).   The right of the Company to commence sales of the common stock is subject to the satisfaction that a Registration Statement shall have been declared and remain effective by and with the SEC, and no stop order with respect to the Registration Statement shall be pending or threatened by the SEC. 

Through the date of this Form 10-K, the Registration Statement had not been declared effective and as such, no sales of stock have occurred. The Company is in the process of increasing its authorized shares with the State of Delaware to reflect the shares to be sold under the Equity Line Purchase Agreement.

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our“ or “us“ and other similar terms collectively means Major League Football, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Our principal offices are presently located at 15515 Lemon Fish Drive, Lakewood Ranch, Florida, 34202. Our telephone number is (847) 924-4332 and (941) 210-7546. Our Internet website is currently located at: www.mlfb.com.

Single Entity Structure

We intend to operate the league as a single entity owned, stand alone, independent sports league. The structure will be based on the design of Major League Soccer (MLS), where a single entity sports league owns and operates all of its teams. This corporate structure provides several compelling benefits, including:

· | Centralized contracting for ‘players’ services for controlled payrolls without violating antitrust laws
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Greater parity among teams 
· | Focus on the bottom line 
· | Controlled costs 


Management believes that this structure will also promote efficiency by depoliticizing decisions on league policies and allowing decisions to be made with consistency and in a timely fashion. Economies of scale will be achieved through centralizing contract negotiations and handling business affairs in the league office to ensure that individual teams are unified in their decision-making. Further, under this structure, we expect teams will operate in the best interest of the league.

MLFB Market Opportunity

MLFB intends to establish a brand that is fan-friendly, exciting, affordable, and interactive, but most importantly provides consumers real value for their sports dollars. MLFB will underscore the fans’ access to team members, coaches, league officials and other fans. Although MLFB’s ticket pricing will be a fraction of that of the established professional leagues (NBA, MLB, NHL, and NFL), its ultimate goal will be to offer its fans an incomparable value-added experience for their entertainment dollar.

Additionally, as a result of a carefully crafted study, we will not locate teams in any established NFL cities and more importantly in any Major League Baseball cities, thus avoiding direct in-season competition with an established sports entity. By positioning teams in prime emerging and under-represented markets throughout the contiguous 48 states (including placing teams in well respected and football fan friendly metropolitan markets in the country), our research suggests that an exciting sports entity like Major League Football will be viewed in a positive light by sports fans throughout the US. Of equal or greater importance to Major League Football is the fact that both established and peripheral football fans in these exciting new markets will finally be afforded the opportunity of establishing their own personal sports identity while at the same time fostering strong community pride.

Lastly, although MLFB’s long-range vision is to maintain a positive working relationship with the NFL, its ultimate intent is to function as an independent, stand-alone entity that captures sports content needed during off season. Although its economic model was, we believe, flawed, the professional Alliance of American Football teams drew a League wide average attendance of 15,000 fans per game and television ratings comparable to the NBA. The XFL had similar positive attendance in its five-game season.

MLFB intends to disseminate its message using a comprehensive marketing strategy that employs both traditional and new media marketing channels. MLFB’s marketing plans are anticipated to create multiple revenue streams and engage sports fans over a variety of mediums. Specifically, MLFB intends to develop a far-reaching internet and mobile strategy that will serve as the backbone of its marketing strategy. This will include developing a mobile initiative, where fans can interact with the league, its players, its coaches, and other fans using their mobile phones all while taking advantage of the player’s name recognition that is utilized with fantasy football. In fantasy football, the participants serve as owners and general managers of virtual professional football teams and select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant players are available.

MLFB also intends to create an interactive website that includes a social networking aspect, podcasts, live video, and more. Along with this new media strategy, cross promotions will also be an important part of the MLFB’s marketing strategy. MLFB plans to work with businesses involved in video, television, print media and the Internet to promote its business. Much of the necessary preliminary work to meet this new strategy has already been performed by our previously announced external contractors, BDB Entertainment Group, Inc., and Red Moon Marketing. 

We intend to review their qualifications and believe that the cumulative effect of this work will help MLFB achieve its early objectives, which include the following:


· | Establish itself as a recognized professional football league 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Build a base of teams and fans broad enough to sustain business over the critical first five years of operation
· | Generate enough revenue to expand its operations in years three through six 
· | Build successful teams located in regions where there are no existing MLB franchises 
· | Adopt a spring schedule to avoid competing with NFL, collegiate and prep football 
· | Provide year-round cash flow from multi-functioning revenue streams 
· | Build a positive image for the league through year-round community relations campaigns 

Professional Sports Market

MLFB recognizes the NFL is the dominant professional sports league in the United States. Although it respects the success of the NFL business model, MLFB’s objective is to position itself as an independent, non-adversarial football league. MLFB believes that its own business model encompasses innovations that will be viewed positively by NFL officials, resulting in a strong working relationship between the two leagues. MLFB staff have held meetings with high-ranking NFL officials to discuss our plans.

MLFB intends to maximize ticket vendor technology and enhance its services to patrons with innovative ticketing procedures that include:


· | Average ticket prices targeted at approximately 25% of the prices of NFL, NBA, NHL & MLB tickets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Year-round cash flow from multiple revenue streams utilizing new technologies. 
· | A highly developed marketing strategy that uses both traditional and new media to attract existing football fans as well as an entirely untapped market of potential new fans.
· | A more interactive website in professional sports using cutting edge technologies to preserve fan loyalty. 
· | Proven executive staff members with considerable practical experience in professional football. 
· | Player and coaching costs projected significantly less than those of the NFL, NBA, NHL, or MLB. 


Initially, teams will operate in either existing collegiate or municipal stadiums during the spring and early summer season. We believe that our business model and long-range vision possess many innovations that will be viewed in a positive light by NFL owners and league officials and will also lend itself to the potential of establishing a strong working relationship with our venture by positioning ourselves in a 100% non-adversarial position to the established NFL.

Audience

MLFB believes that today’s market demands a controlled deliverable to a targeted viewing audience as well as controlled advertising deliverables to specific targeted demographic audiences as well. Other sports attract audiences that are only a fraction of that number, in producing the sponsor and advertiser concerns. Therefore, retaining the mass appeal needed to attract such an audience is an over-arching consideration that shapes much of what we do and what concerns the Company.
Merchandising & Licensing Overview

The thrust of our licensing and co-branding strategy is to create an increase in brand value for MLFB and the partners we align with. In order for the league to have a robust licensing and co-branding business, we have created a 3-tier approach that focuses on generating strong revenue streams for the league and initiating value based collaborative efforts that further enhance the MLFB brand.

The main benefits of the program are:


· | Fans will find quality items at more favorable price points. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Teams will have higher profit on items and stop tying up money on inventory they cannot properly sell.
· | More fans will be wearing and supporting the team and league branded merchandise. 


We plan to develop private label products where we will feature products that are fan favorites (hats, shirts, popular novelties, and gifts, etc.) all manufactured at the highest level, and priced below traditional licensed sports merchandise programs. All merchandise, when league sanctioned, will be pre- ticketed and priced.
