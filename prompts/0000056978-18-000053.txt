Explanatory Note
Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements
Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. ("We", the "Company" or "K&S") is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A ("Form 10-K/A") to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, which was originally filed on November 16, 2017 ("Original Filing"), to restate the following: our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the related notes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related notes as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016, and our unaudited quarterly data included in this Form 10-K/A, including the financial information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are also providing restated disclosures regarding our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
As previously disclosed, on May 10, 2018, the Company’s Audit Committee, in consultation with the Board of Directors, concluded that the Company’s previously issued financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 could no longer be relied upon. This decision was reached after discussions with the Company’s senior management and outside advisers. 
The above was a result of the Company’s determination that the warranty expense and warranty accrual accounts had been misstated for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 as a result of inaccurate and unsupported journal entries recorded due to management override of controls. The management override of controls was identified during an internal investigation, which was concluded in May 2018, related to an unauthorized payment based on falsified accounting records that had been initiated by a senior finance employee to an unapproved vendor in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Management has determined this to be a misappropriation of the Company's assets. The unauthorized payment was subsequently recovered in full. We determined that the manual journal entries, initiated by this employee to correct the Company's failure to properly include labor costs in our warranty accrual, lacked supporting documentation and were accounted for incorrectly. In addition, the Company also identified adjustments that were required to be made to retained earnings, warranty expense and accrual accounts to correct the inappropriate exclusion of the estimated labor costs related to warranty repairs from its historical warranty accounting. While the latter adjustments are not deemed material, the Company is adjusting retained earnings, warranty expense and warranty accrual accounts as part of the restatement.
To correct these misstatements and to address matters related to the foregoing with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, we have restated the following: our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the related notes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related notes as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016, and our unaudited quarterly data included in this Form 10-K/A, including the financial information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe that presenting all of the restated information in this Form 10-K/A allows investors to review all pertinent data in a single presentation. See Note 2 - Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K/A for more detail.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In light of the foregoing, management has reassessed its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of that reassessment, management identified a material weakness related to the recording and review of manual journal entries related to our warranty accrual and, accordingly, has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017. Management is therefore restating its report on internal control over financial reporting. For a description of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and remediation efforts, see "Part II - Item 9A - Controls and Procedures."

Key Events in Fiscal 2017
Impairment Charges
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred in connection with the EA/APMR reporting unit (the former Assembléon) based on the results of an updated long-term financial outlook for that business that was conducted as part of the Company’s strategic review due to lower demand as compared to forecast. The projection used in the fiscal 2016 annual impairment test had been developed based on the fiscal 2016 actual results, where the actual revenue had exceeded the forecast. This updated outlook projected that the near-term projected cash flows are expected to be lower than previously forecasted due to softer near-term demand in the System-in-package market. Under ASC 350, the Company is required to test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or when a triggering event has occurred that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill and intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company has performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the EA/APMR reporting unit. 
The Company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the EA/APMR reporting unit. The cash flow projections used in the discounted cash flow model were prepared using the forecasted financial results of the reporting unit, which was based upon underlying estimates of the total market size using independent third party industry reports, and market share data developed using the combination of independent third party data and our internal data. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value of the EA/APMR reporting unit include terminal growth rate of 2.5%, cost reduction initiatives including restructuring, working capital, tax rate and a weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) of 10.45%. Our calculation of the estimated fair value of goodwill was based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Any changes in the assumptions may result in additional impairment. 
Following the Company's early adoption in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment (i.e. Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test) was eliminated. Accordingly, the Company's impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Based on the calculation, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the EA/APMR reporting unit exceeded its fair value by $35.2 million as of July 1, 2017, requiring an impairment charge of this amount. The goodwill impairment charge, which is a non-cash charge, has been reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2017.
In connection with the evaluation of the goodwill impairment in the EA/APMR reporting unit, the Company assessed tangible and intangible assets for impairment prior to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. As a result of this analysis, it was determined that there were no impairment charges to record relating to these assets.
Business Combinations
On July 2, 2017, Kulicke and Soffa Holland Holdings B.V. (“KSHH”), the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with the shareholders of Liteq to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of Liteq. Liteq is a lithography solutions provider for advanced packaging. 
The purchase price consisted of EUR 25.0 million (approximately $28.6 million) cash paid at closing and additional potential earn-out payments based on Liteq's cumulative pre-tax earnings and cumulative engineering expenses for 2018 to 2022. The acquisition expands the Company's presence in the advanced packaging market. 
Share Repurchase Program
On August 15, 2017, the Company announced that it fully executed its $100 million share repurchase program (the "Program"), originally announced on August 27, 2014. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the "New Program") that authorizes the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company's common shares, from time to time over the three year period ending August 1, 2020. The Company may purchase shares of its common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The Company has entered into a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act to facilitate repurchases under the New Program. The New Program is effective immediately, may be suspended or discontinued at any time and will be funded using the Company's available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the New Program depend on market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. During the year ended September 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares of common stock at a cost of $18.2 million. As of September 30, 2017, our remaining share repurchase authorization under the New Program was approximately $88.8 million.

Segments
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized our reporting structure into two reportable segments consisting of: (i) Capital Equipment; and (ii) Aftermarket Products and Services ("APS"). Subsequently, we recasted financial results for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 based on the revised segment structure. The change in the segments was a result of changes to our organizational structure effected during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to streamline business operations to improve profitability and competitiveness and reflects a change in the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews information to assess our performance and make decisions about resource allocation. As part of these actions, we transitioned to a new internal management structure whereby the operating management responsible for tools used to assemble semiconductor devices, including integrated circuits (“ICs”), high and low powered discrete devices, light-emitting diodes (“LEDs”) and power modules, services, spares, maintenance, repair and upgrading operating segments, was brought under common leadership in the APS segment. Subsequent to the reorganization, the Capital Equipment segment comprises of the manufacturing and selling of ball bonders, wafer level bonders, wedge bonders, advanced packaging and electronic assembly solutions to semiconductor device manufacturers, IDMs, OSATs, other electronics manufacturers and automotive electronics suppliers. 
For further information on our operating segments and the reorganization actions, please refer to Note 16, "Segment Information," to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K/A. Our prior period reportable segment information has been recasted to reflect the current segment structure and conform to the current period presentation.
Business Environment
The semiconductor business environment is highly volatile and is driven by internal dynamics, both cyclical and seasonal, in addition to macroeconomic forces. Over the long term, semiconductor consumption has historically grown, and is forecast to continue to grow. This growth is driven, in part, by regular advances in device performance and by price declines that result from improvements in manufacturing technology. In order to exploit these trends, semiconductor manufacturers, both IDMs and OSATs, periodically invest aggressively in latest generation capital equipment. This buying pattern often leads to periods of excess supply and reduced capital spending—the so-called semiconductor cycle. Within this broad semiconductor cycle there are also, generally weaker, seasonal effects that are specifically tied to annual, end-consumer purchasing patterns. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers prepare for heightened demand by adding or replacing equipment capacity by the end of the September quarter. Occasionally, this results in subsequent reductions in the December quarter. This annual seasonality can be overshadowed by effects of the broader semiconductor cycle. Macroeconomic factors also affect the industry, primarily through their effect on business and consumer demand for electronic devices, as well as other products that have significant electronic content such as automobiles, white goods, and telecommunication equipment. 
Our Capital Equipment segment is primarily affected by the industry's internal cyclical and seasonal dynamics in addition to broader macroeconomic factors that can positively and negatively affect our financial performance. The sales mix of IDM and OSAT customers in any period also impacts financial performance, as changes in this mix can affect our products' average selling prices and gross margins due to differences in volume purchases and machine configurations required by each customer type.
Our APS segment is less volatile than our Capital Equipment segment. APS sales are more directly tied to semiconductor unit consumption rather than capacity requirements and production capability improvements. 
We continue to position our business to leverage our research and development leadership and innovation and to focus our efforts on mitigating volatility, improving profitability and ensuring longer-term growth. We remain focused on operational excellence, expanding our product offerings and managing our business efficiently throughout business cycles. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited, forecasting is difficult, and we generally experience typical industry seasonality.
To limit potential adverse cyclical, seasonal and macroeconomic effects on our financial position, we have continued our efforts to maintain a strong balance sheet. As of September 30, 2017, our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were $608.9 million, a $61.0 million increase from the prior fiscal year end. We believe this strong cash position will allow us to continue to invest in product development and pursue non-organic opportunities.
Technology Leadership
We compete largely by offering our customers advanced equipment and tools available for the interconnect processes. We believe our technology leadership contributes to the strong market positions of our ball bonder, wedge bonder and tools products. To maintain our competitive advantage, we invest in product development activities designed to produce improvements to existing products and to deliver next-generation products. These investments often focus as much on improvements in the semiconductor assembly process as on specific pieces of assembly equipment or tools. In order to generate these improvements, we typically

work in close collaboration with customers, end users, and other industry members. In addition to producing technical advances, these collaborative development efforts strengthen customer relationships and enhance our reputation as a technology leader and solutions provider. 
In addition to gold, silver alloy wire and aluminum wire, our leadership in the industry's use of copper wire for the bonding process is an example of the benefits of our collaborative efforts. By working with customers, material suppliers, and other equipment suppliers, we have developed a series of robust, high-yielding production processes, which have made copper wire widely accepted and significantly reduced the cost of assembling an integrated circuit. 
Our leadership also has allowed us to maintain a competitive position in the latest generations of gold and copper ball bonders, which enables our customers to handle the leading technologies in terms of bond pad pitch, silicon with the latest node and complex wire bonding requirement. We continue to see demand for our large bondable area (“LA” and “ELA”) configured machines. Both LA and ELA options are now available on all of our Power Series (“PS”) models and allow our customers to gain added efficiencies and to reduce the cost of packaging. 
We optimize our bonder platforms to deliver variants of our products to serve emerging high-growth markets. For example, we have developed extensions of our main ball bonding platforms (IConnPS MEM PLUS) to address opportunities in memory assembly, in particular for NAND Flash storage.    
Our leading technology for wedge bonder equipment uses ribbon or heavy wire for different applications such as power electronics, automotive and semiconductor applications. The advanced interconnect capabilities of PowerFusionPS improve the processing of high-density power packages, due to an expanded bondable area, wider leadframe capability, indexing accuracy and teach mode. In all cases, we are making a concerted effort to develop commonality of subsystems and design practices, in order to improve performance and design efficiencies. We believe this will benefit us as it will increase synergies between the various engineering product groups. Furthermore, we continually research adjacent market segments where our technologies could be used. Many of these initiatives are in the early stages of development and some have yielded results.
Another example of our developing equipment for high-growth niche markets is our AT Premier PLUS. This machine utilizes a modified wire bonding process to mechanically place bumps on devices in a wafer format, for variants of the flip chip assembly process. Typical applications include complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) image sensors, surface acoustical wave (“SAW”) filters and high brightness LEDs. These applications are commonly used in most, if not all, smartphones available today in the market. We also have expanded the use of AT Premier PLUS for wafer level wire bonding for micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”) and other sensors.
Our technology leadership and bonding process know-how have enabled us to develop highly function-specific equipment with high throughput and accuracy. This forms the foundation for our advanced packaging equipment development. We established a dedicated team to develop and manufacture advanced packaging bonders for the emerging 2.5 dimensional integrated circuit (“2.5D IC”) and 3 dimensional integrated circuit (“3D IC”) markets. By reducing the interconnect dimensions, 2.5D ICs and 3D ICs are expected to provide form factor, performance and power efficiency enhancements over traditional flip-chip packages in production today. High-performance processing and memory applications, in addition to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, are anticipated to be earlier adopters of this new packaging technology. 
We have also broadened our advanced packaging solutions for mass reflow to include flip chip, wafer level packaging ("WLP"), fan-out wafer level packaging ("FOWLP"), advanced package-on-package, embedded die, and System-in-Package ("SiP"). These solutions enable us to diversify our business while further expanding market reach into the automotive, LED lighting, medical and industrial segments with electronic assembly solutions.
We bring the same technology focus to our tools business, driving tool design and manufacturing technology to optimize the performance and process capability of the equipment in which our tools are used. For all our equipment products, tools are an integral part of their process capability. We believe our unique ability to simultaneously develop both equipment and tools is a core strength supporting our products' technological differentiation.

Sales and Customer Support
We believe long-term customer relationships are critical to our success, and comprehensive sales and customer support are an important means of establishing those relationships. To maintain these relationships, we primarily utilize our direct sales force, as well as distribution channels such as agents and distributors, depending on the product, region, or end-user application. In all cases, our goal is to position our sales and customer support resources near our customers' facilities so as to provide support for customers in their own language and consistent with local customs. Our sales and customer support resources are located primarily in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, Thailand, the U.S., Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands. Supporting these local resources, we have technology centers offering additional process expertise in Singapore, China, Israel, the U.S and the Netherlands. 
By establishing relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, OSATs, and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems, we gain insight into our customers' future semiconductor packaging strategies. In addition, we also send our products and equipment to customers or potential customers for trial and evaluation. These insights assist us in our efforts to develop products and processes that address our customers' future assembly requirements. 
Backlog
Our backlog consists of customer orders scheduled for shipment within the next twelve months. A majority of our orders are subject to cancellation or deferral by our customers with limited or no penalties. Also, customer demand for our products can vary dramatically without prior notice. Because of the volatility of customer demand, possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.
The following table reflects our backlog as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016:

 | As of 
(in thousands) | September 30, 2017 | | October 1, 2016
Backlog | $ | 190,702 | | $ | 87,200

Manufacturing
We believe excellence in manufacturing can create a competitive advantage, both by producing at lower costs and by providing superior responsiveness to changes in customer demand. To achieve these goals, we manage our manufacturing operations through a single organization and believe that fewer, larger factories allow us to capture economies of scale and generate cost savings through lower manufacturing costs. 
Capital Equipment
Our equipment manufacturing activities consist mainly of integrating outsourced parts and subassemblies and testing finished products to customer specifications. We largely utilize an outsource model, allowing us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures. For certain low-volume, high customization parts, we manufacture subassemblies ourselves. Just-in-time inventory management has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and lowered our on-hand inventory requirements. Raw materials used in our equipment manufacturing are generally available from multiple sources; however, many outsourced parts and components are only available from a single or limited number of sources.
Our ball bonder, wedge bonder and APAMA bonder manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in Singapore. Our Hybrid and Electronic Assembly solutions manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in the Netherlands. We have ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications for our equipment manufacturing facilities in Singapore and the Netherlands.
Aftermarket Products and Services 
We manufacture dicing blades, capillaries and a portion of our bonding wedge inventory at our facility in Suzhou, China. The capillaries are made using blanks produced at our facility in Yokneam, Israel. We both produce and outsource the production of our bonding wedges. Both the Suzhou and Yokneam facilities are ISO 9001 certified. The Suzhou facility is also ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 certified.
Spares are manufactured at our facilities in Singapore and Netherlands. 
Research and Product Development 
Many of our customers generate technology roadmaps describing their projected packaging technology requirements. Our research and product development activities are focused on delivering robust production solutions to those projected requirements. We accomplish this by regularly introducing improved versions of existing products or by developing next-generation products. We follow this product development methodology in all our major product lines. Research and development expense was $100.2 million, $92.4 million, and $90.0 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
Where circumstances warrant, we apply for patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, and manufacturing activities. We currently hold a number of U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. We believe the duration of our patents often exceeds the commercial life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents. Additionally, we believe much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software.

Environmental Matters 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use, emission, discharge, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third-party waste disposal sites we use or have used. 
We have incurred in the past, and expect in the future to incur costs to comply with environmental laws. We are not, however, currently aware of any material costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters, including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third-party waste disposal sites, that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. However, it is possible that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future. 
Business Continuity Management Plan
We have developed and implemented a global Business Continuity Management Plan ("Plan") for our business operations. The Plan is designed to facilitate the prompt resumption of our business operations and functions arising from an event which impacts or potentially impacts our business operations.  As the scale, timing, and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, the Plan has been designed to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. The Plan provides a structured framework for safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting our books and records, perpetuating critical business functions, and enabling the continuation of customer transactions.
