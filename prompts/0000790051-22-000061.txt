Information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All references to "Notes" refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Business Strategy
We strive to be a market leading manufacturer of highly engineered products in the various markets we serve. Introduced in early 2018, Vision 2025 set the tone for a returns-focused capital deployment strategy intended to create sustained value for all of our stakeholders, with an intermediate-term goal of achieving $15 of earnings per share by 2025. Key pillars of this strategic plan include: dedication to driving above market revenue growth, utilizing the Carlisle Operating System (“COS”), an operating structure and strategy deployment system based on lean enterprise and six sigma principles, consistently to drive efficiencies and operating leverage, building scale with synergistic acquisitions, continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent, supporting continued organic growth through capital expenditures, and returning excess capital to stockholders.
We utilize COS to drive improving operational performance. COS is a continuous improvement process that defines the way we do business and is well-ingrained in our culture throughout Carlisle. Waste is eliminated and efficiencies are improved enterprise wide, driving increased profitability. Improvements expand beyond production areas, as COS drives new product innovation, engineering, supply chain management, warranty and product rationalization. 
With accelerating demand for energy-efficient solutions for sustainable buildings of the future, we will continue to seek ways to improve our manufacturing processes to lower carbon emissions through COS. Importantly, we will continue to emphasize the development of products that ultimately help reduce carbon emissions from the rooftop, throughout the building envelope, and across all businesses.
In September 2021, Carlisle took a significant step in expanding our water, air and vapor barrier business in acquiring ASP Henry Holdings, Inc. (“Henry”) within our Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”) business segment. This acquisition is a great example of both our commitment to building scale through synergistic acquisitions and growing our breadth of sustainable, energy-efficiency enhancing products and systems. Refer to Note 3 for more details regarding acquisitions of the Company’s businesses during the past three years.
We also pursue the sale of a business when we determine it no longer fits within the Company’s long-term goals or strategy. Accordingly, in August 2021, we completed the sale of our Carlisle Brake & Friction ("CBF") segment for gross proceeds of (i) $250 million cash at closing, subject to certain adjustments, and (ii) the right to receive up to an additional $125 million based on CBF's achievement of certain performance targets. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of our discontinued operations.
While the coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19"), supply chain challenges, pervasive and persistent inflation, and labor shortages have been material headwinds to our operations, we believe our proactive approach to continuous improvement initiatives have driven Carlisle’s resilience and ability to report solid financial results in 2021. Our efforts drove our acceleration through the recovery by further improving the efficiency of our businesses through COS, continuing to make the investments necessary to deliver a world-class and customer-valued Carlisle Experience, and ensuring we maintain discipline and rigor in our capital allocation process. Taken together, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our goals outlined in our strategic plan, Vision 2025. See Description of Business by Segment below for a more detailed discussion of our Vision 2025 strategy.

Description of Business by Segment
Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”)
Products, Markets and Locations
The CCM segment has evolved from a supplier of the first single-ply ethylene propylene diene monomer (“EPDM”) roofing membranes in the early 1960s to today, where we deliver innovative, easy-to-install and energy-efficient solutions through the Carlisle Experience for customers who are creating the sustainable building of the future. CCM manufactures a complete range of building envelope products for commercial, industrial and residential buildings, including single-ply roofing, rigid foam insulation, spray polyurethane foam technologies, architectural metal, heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") hardware and sealants, below-grade waterproofing, and air and vapor barrier systems focused on the weatherproofing and thermal performance of the building envelope. CCM is a leading North American and European building products manufacturer offering a complete set of solutions and systems to aid in the design of efficient building envelope construction projects, backed by industry-leading product innovations and a focus on green principles.
EPDM, thermoplastic polyolefin (“TPO”) and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) membrane and polyisocyanurate ("polyiso") insulation are sold together in warranted systems or separately in non-warranted systems to the new construction, re-roofing and maintenance, general construction and industrial markets. These products are primarily sold under the Carlisle SynTec, Versico, Weatherbond and Hunter Panels brands in the United States of America (“U.S.” or “United States”) and throughout the world, and EPDM membranes under the Resitrix and Hertalan brands primarily in Europe. The segment sells its expanded polystyrene for a variety of end markets, predominantly roofing and waterproofing through its Insulfoam brand. The segment sells its building envelope systems under the Henry brand primarily in the U.S. and Canada.
CCM operates manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States, its primary market, and in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom ("U.K.") and Romania. The majority of CCM’s products are sold through a network of authorized sales representatives and distributors in North America and Europe.
Key Raw Materials
Key raw materials for this segment include methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”), polyol, EPDM polymer, TPO polymer, silicone polymer, carbon black and coated steel. These raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply. The vendor typically has multiple processing facilities for key raw materials that are single sourced.
Seasonality
Revenues and earnings for CCM have historically been higher in the second and third quarters due to increased construction activity during those periods from favorable weather conditions.
Market Factors
Backlog orders were $1.7 billion and $129.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in 2022. The large increase in backlog orders at the end of 2021 was due to a rapid rise in demand as the U.S. economy rebounded, compounded by supply chain challenges in meeting that demand.
CCM serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2021 CCM's two largest customers represented 30.9% of this segment’s revenues and 24.7% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s revenues and operating income and the Company's consolidated revenues and operating income. Both of these customers' business with CCM is covered under a number of independent local agreements.
This segment faces competition from numerous competitors that produce roofing, insulation and waterproofing products for commercial and residential applications. The level of competition within this market varies by product line and region. As one of four major manufacturers in the single-ply industry, CCM competes through innovative products, long-term warranties and customer service. CCM offers separately priced extended warranty contracts on certain of its products ranging from five to 40 years, the most significant being those offered on its installed single-ply roofing systems primarily in the United States, subject to certain exclusions, that covers leaks in the roofing system attributable to a problem with the particular product or the installation of the product. The building owner must have the roofing system installed by an independent authorized roofing contractor trained by CCM to install its 
4 


roofing systems in order to qualify for the warranty. Each warranted roof system is inspected by Carlisle prior to warranty issuance.
Vision 2025 Strategy
Our strategy under Vision 2025 for the CCM segment is to:

Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG")
Our legacy of environmental responsibility began more than 100 years ago when scrap rubber was introduced into the inner-tube production line. As we continued our ESG journey, we advanced our sustainability goals by creating and implementing the Carlisle Environmental Sustainability Policy, which specifies the collection of detailed ESG data from our facilities across the globe. Through evaluating the data, we can measure factors like pay equity and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions which we will use to establish improvement targets. The policy further establishes a process to engage our supply chain and monitor compliance with Carlisle policies for fair labor practices and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Finally, the policy formalizes our commitment to certify all our manufacturing facilities to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System by the end of 2025.
In 2021, we announced plans to invest more than $60 million to build a state-of-the-art Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") certified facility in Sikeston, Missouri where CCM will manufacture energy-efficient polyiso insulation. Additionally, we have invested approximately $12 million into a 40,000 square foot research and development technical center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. This investment will help us to maintain a technological leadership position in the building and construction industry while meeting the demands of climate adaptation for buildings.
The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer reviews and approves the strategic direction for Carlisle’s sustainability approach. Carlisle’s sustainability approach is guided to execution through the Vice President of Sustainability and the ESG Steering Committee. The Vice President of Sustainability, reporting to the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, leads the ESG Steering Committee. The ESG Steering Committee is composed of key executives in the areas of human resources, COS, legal, and purchasing departments. The ESG Steering Committee develops strategy, provides oversight, and monitors accountability in our ESG and climate-related initiatives through the deployment of the Carlisle Environmental Sustainability Policy. On a periodic basis, Carlisle's Board of Directors (the "Board") reviews the status of the Company's ESG initiatives. The Vice President of Sustainability and members of the ESG Steering Committee work with senior leadership within Carlisle’s business units to deploy and accelerate Carlisle’s Sustainability strategy.
Our environmental sustainability initiatives and strategy are discussed further in our 2020 Corporate Sustainability Report, which can be found on our website at www.carlisle.com; this report is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
Investing in Our People
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 11,000 people, excluding approximately 500 contractors.
We believe that talent acquisition and retention are critical drivers to delivering the goals of Vision 2025 and that a trained, diverse and inspired workforce is integral to delivering value to our stakeholders. We begin with a recruiting process that reaches a wide array of potential employees and includes the engagement of specialized, diverse recruiting firms such as The Standard Diversity Network, Jobs4Women.net, Asian American Jobsite, African American Jobsite and many others.
We also partner with universities in the U.S. and outside the U.S., recruiting for functional talent in management, sales, finance, information technology and other functions from the communities in which we work.

This program helps these employees to define their own leadership skills to enable their future success.
•The Carlisle Management Development Program was established with several university MBA programs and is a one-year post-MBA rotational program designed to give an expedited experience for participants within business segments across functional areas.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Carlisle has pledged to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected. In May 2018, Carlisle joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™, a growing coalition of nearly 2,000 CEOs pledging to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. By signing on to this commitment, Carlisle is pledging to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected. CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ is cultivating a new type of ecosystem centered around collaboration and sharing.
Carlisle’s commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workforce includes a policy of non-discriminatory treatment and respect of human rights for all current and prospective employees. Discrimination on the basis of an individual’s race, religion, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, national origin or veteran’s status is not permitted by Carlisle and is illegal in many jurisdictions. Carlisle respects the human rights of all employees and strives to treat them with dignity consistent with standards and practices recognized by the international community. Carlisle is committed to respecting all human rights, as articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
In addition to policies for fair treatment, Carlisle also works to address unconscious bias in the workplace. Unconscious bias training is a key component of Carlisle’s leadership development programs. This training helps inform leaders of biases and provides a forum for them to explore how Carlisle can strengthen our culture of inclusion by addressing and breaking down biases. This has contributed to an effort to gain equal diversity representation throughout Carlisle. 
As of the end of 2021, we achieved gender and race pay equity across our U.S. workforce. This means compensating employees the same when they perform the same job duties, while accounting for other factors, such as their experience level, job performance and tenure with the Company. Carlisle's minimum starting wage is $15 per hour for our entire U.S. workforce.
