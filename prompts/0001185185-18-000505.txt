ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate Structure
 
We were formed as BioSig Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, in February 2009 and in April 2011 we merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary, BioSig Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with the Delaware corporation continuing as the surviving entity. We are principally devoted to improving biomedical signal processing to extract information from physiologic signals.  Our initial focus is on providing intracardiac signal information to electrophysiologists during electrophysiology (EP) studies and catheter ablation for complex arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). We have not generated any revenue to date and consequently our operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.
Business Overview
 
We are a development stage medical device company developing a proprietary biomedical signal processing technology platform to extract information from physiologic signals. Our initial emphasis is on providing intracardiac signal information to electrophysiologists during EP studies and catheter ablation of AF and VT. Our first product is the PURE (Precise Uninterrupted Real-time evaluation of Electrograms) EP™ System, a surface electrocardiogram and intracardiac multichannel recording and analysis system that acquires, processes and displays electrocardiograms and electrograms required during electrophysiology studies and catheter ablation procedures.

The PURE EP System is designed to assist electrophysiologists in making clinical decisions in real-time by providing information that, we believe, is not always easily obtained, if at all, from any other equipment presently used in electrophysiology labs.  The PURE EP System’s ability to minimize noise and artifacts and acquire high fidelity cardiac signals will potentially increase these signals’ diagnostic value, and therefore offer improved accuracy and efficiency of the EP studies and related procedures.  We are developing signal processing tools within the PURE EP System. We believe that these will assist electrophysiologists in further differentiating true signals from noise and will provide guidance in identifying ablation targets.
 
Since June 2011, we have collaborated with physicians affiliated with the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas who provided us with data for initial technology validation.  The physicians had provided us with digital recordings obtained with conventional electrophysiology recording systems during different stages of electrophysiology studies.  Using our proprietary signal processing tools that are part of the PURE EP System, we analyzed those recordings and successfully removed baseline wander, noise and artifacts from the data thereby providing better diagnostic quality signals.
 
In the second and third quarters of 2013, we performed and finalized testing of our proof of concept unit by initially using an electrocardiogram/intracardiac simulator at our lab, and then by obtaining pre-clinical recordings from the lab at the University of California at Los Angeles.   We believe that our proof of concept unit performed well as compared to the conventional recording system, in that the electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals displayed on our proof of concept unit showed less baseline wander, noise and artifacts compared to signals displayed on the conventional recording system.  Subsequently, we analyzed the results of our proof of concept unit to determine the final design of the PURE EP System prototype.
 
After conducting research of peer-reviewed EP publications (see Initial Analysis in Our Products section below), we contacted Samuel J. Asirvatham. M.D. (who we believed to be an expert in the field of signal-based catheter ablation), at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Since the end of 2014, we have collaborated with Dr. Asirvatham and other physicians affiliated with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida. We have performed pre-clinical studies at Mayo Clinic since 2015 to validate technology within the PURE EP System prototype. These studies have been designed to determine clinical effectiveness for features within the PURE EP System that are in development. Since March 2016, we have published seven manuscripts in collaboration with the physicians from Mayo Clinic evidencing our pre-clinical findings. The publications cover a variety of subjects pertaining to the PURE EP System as an enhanced electrophysiology recording system with signal acquisition and differentiation and having specific visualization of different electrophysiology signals.
 
Our initial focus is on improving intracardiac signal processing and diagnostic information for catheter ablation procedures for the complex arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia, an arrhythmia evidenced by a fast heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers of the heart, which can be life-threatening. Cardiac catheter ablation is a procedure that corrects conduction of electrical impulses in the heart that cause arrhythmias and is now a preferred treatment for certain arrhythmias.  During this procedure, a catheter is usually inserted using a venous access into a specific area of the heart. Cryo or radiofrequency energy is delivered through the catheter to destroy small areas of the heart muscle that cause the abnormal heart rhythm.  According to a 2014 article in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, catheter ablation should be considered as the first-line therapy for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (“Ablation Versus Drugs: What is the Best First-Line Therapy for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation?” (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol. 2014; 7:739-746).
 
Catheter ablation for many arrhythmias have high success rates; however, more complex or long-standing examples of the disease often require multiple procedures (each typically lasting from 3-6 hours), evidencing the need for additional research and technology to diagnose and treat these cases. Consequently, ablating AF and VT has been regarded as being extremely difficult. Therefore, access to these procedures has traditionally been limited to being performed by only the most well-trained cardiologists; however, advancements in new technologies and techniques show a strong growth rate for these procedures.

If we are able to develop our product as designed, we believe that the PURE EP System and its signal processing tools will contribute to an increase in the number of procedures performed in each electrophysiology lab and possibly improved patient outcomes.
 
Our significant achievements to date include:
 
 
● | Initial system concept validation has been performed in collaboration with physicians at the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas in June 2011. The Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute provided challenging recordings obtained with electrophysiology recording systems presently in use at the institute during various electrophysiology studies. Our technology team successfully imported the data into the PURE EP System software and using proprietary signal processing, the PURE EP System software was able to reduce baseline wander, noise, and artifacts from the data and therefore provide better diagnostic quality signals.

● | The Cardiac Arrhythmia Center at the University of California at Los Angeles and Dr. Kalyanam Shivkumar, a former member of our board of directors, have played a significant role in the initial functional testing of our hardware. Dr. Shivkumar and his team have enabled us to learn the connectivity of the lab and its devices that pertain to where our PURE EP System will fit in. In June 2013, we commenced our first proof of concept pre-clinical study with the assistance of Dr. Shivkumar in order to further test the components of the PURE EP System hardware, as further explained below.

● | We are developing signal processing tools within the PURE EP System that will assist electrophysiologists in further differentiating true signals from noise, which may potentially provide guidance in identifying ablation targets. The signal processing tools are expected to be an integral part of the software of the PURE EP System, which we believe will significantly facilitate the locating of ablation targets.

● | In the second and third quarters of 2013, we performed and finalized testing of our proof of concept unit by initially using an electrocardiogram/intracardiac simulator at our lab, and subsequently by obtaining pre-clinical recordings from the lab at the University of California at Los Angeles. As part of the testing, we simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals on our proof of concept unit and GE’s CardioLab recording system. An identical signal was applied to the input of both systems and the monitor of our proof of concept unit was positioned next to the monitor of GE’s CardioLab recording system to allow for visual comparison. We believe that our proof of concept unit performed well as compared to GE’s CardioLab recording system, in that the electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals displayed on our proof of concept unit showed less baseline wander, noise and artifacts compared to signals displayed on GE’s CardioLab recording system. However, because this was a proof of concept test, without any clearly established protocols, we cannot present this data for publication and we do not have any independent verification or peer review of these findings.

Our Industry
 
Electrophysiology is the study of the propagation of electrical impulses throughout the heart. Electrophysiology studies are focused on the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias, a medical condition in which conduction of electrical impulses within the heart vary from the normal. Such conditions may be associated with significant health risks to patients. The cardiac electrophysiology study for the evaluation of cardiac conduction disorders has evolved rapidly from a research tool to an established clinical treatment. This technique permits detailed analyses of the mechanism underlying cardiac arrhythmias and determines precise locations of the sites of origin of these arrhythmias, thereby aiding in treatment strategies.
 
Pharmacological, or medicine-based, therapies have traditionally been used as initial treatments, but they often fail to adequately control the arrhythmia and may have significant side effects. Catheter ablation is now often recommended for an arrhythmia that medicine cannot control. Catheter ablation involves advancing several flexible catheters into the patient’s blood vessels, usually either in the femoral vein, internal jugular vein or subclavian vein. The catheters are then advanced towards the heart. Electrical impulses are then used to induce the arrhythmia and local heating, or freezing is used to ablate (destroy) the abnormal tissue that is causing it. Catheter ablation of most arrhythmias has a high success rate and multiple procedures per patient have been found to be more successful.
 
Catheter ablation is performed by an electrophysiologist (a specially trained cardiologist) in a catheterization lab or a specialized electrophysiology lab. It is estimated that there are about 3,000 dedicated electrophysiology labs in the U.S. and 1,500 labs outside the U.S., each with an electrophysiology recording system costing an average of $250,000. We believe that the current value of the electrophysiology recording device market in the U.S. is approximately $750 million, based upon the number of electrophysiology labs in U.S. and the average cost of the recording system in each lab. With the potential of 12 million atrial fibrillation patients by the year 2050 (according to the Atrial Fibrillation Fact Sheet, last updated in August 2017 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and improvements in technology for atrial fibrillation ablation therapy, significant growth is predicted for the number of hospitals building electrophysiology labs. According to the 2016 HRI Global Opportunities in Medical Devices & Diagnostics report, analysts forecast the global market for electrophysiology devices will grow at a 10.3 percent compound annual growth rate, from $3.68 billion in 2015 to $6.015 billion in 2020; in addition, global ablation procedure numbers are predicted to grow from 865,000 to 1,350,000 per year.
 
Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Tachycardia
 
We believe that the clearer recordings and additional information provided by the PURE EP System may improve outcomes during electrophysiology studies and ablation procedures for a variety of arrhythmias. For patients who are candidates for ablation, an electrophysiology study is necessary to define the targeted sites for the ablation procedure. Two common, yet complex, conditions for which ablation procedures are performed are atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. We believe that in the near future, the PURE EP System may have a meaningful impact on assisting ablation strategies for these conditions.

 Table of Contents

Most cardiac arrhythmias are well understood, and ablation simply requires destroying a small area of heart tissue possessing electrical abnormality. In contrast, complex arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, have complex pathophysiology and, because knowledge of their origins and mechanisms are incomplete, ablation treatments for these arrhythmias are largely empirical. Furthermore, the length of these procedures, which typically last from 3-6 hours, exposes the physician and staff to extensive radiation, requiring them to wear heavy lead vests. Consequently, ablating atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia has been regarded as being extremely difficult. Therefore, access to these procedures has traditionally been limited to being performed by only especially well-trained cardiologists; however, advancements in new technologies and techniques show a strong growth rate for these procedures.
 
AF is the most common heart rhythm disorder in the world and increases the risk for stroke 5-fold. In 2010, there was a reported global prevalence of 33.5 million (20.9 million men and 12.6 million women). In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that there are an estimated 2.7-6.1 million Americans suffering with AF, more than 750,000 patients hospitalized annually for the condition, and AF contributes to an estimated 130,000 deaths each year. Despite the fact that physicians have been performing radiofrequency ablations since the 1990s, catheter-based treatment is offered to less than 3% of the AF patient population in the U.S. and Europe. An increasing proportion of diagnosed atrial fibrillation cases are now being treated via ablation, as both physician confidence and the devices used in these procedures improve. A growing amount of positive clinical data has demonstrated the efficacy of AF ablation when compared to the traditional first-line treatment of anti-arrhythmic drugs. As a result, AF ablation is becoming the fastest growing procedure type in this market. The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force reported that catheter-directed ablation of atrial fibrillation represents a substantial achievement that promises better therapy for a large number of patients presently resistant to pharmacological or electrical conversion to sinus rhythm (“2014 ACCF/AHA/HRS Focused Update on the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (Updating the 2011 Guideline)”). However, rates of success and complications may vary, sometimes considerably.
 
According to the Heart Rhythm Society, ventricular tachycardia is the most dangerous arrhythmia since it may result in ventricular fibrillation, a rapid chaotic heartbeat in the lower chambers of the heart which can often result in sudden cardiac death. Because the fibrillating muscle cannot contract and pump blood to the brain and vital organs, ventricular fibrillation is the number one cause of sudden cardiac death accounting for more than 350,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. Ventricular tachycardia is typically treated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs, or a combination of ablation along with an ICD. Catheter ablation of VT has historically been used primarily for drug refractory ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICDs. However, advances in electro-anatomical mapping systems, techniques to identify ablation sites during sinus rhythm, and the use of hemodynamic support devices has broadened the applicability of catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias. When performed in centers with high procedural volumes, the rates of complications remain relatively low. However, success rates have historically been quite variable and highly dependent on the specific ablation approach adopted.
 
According to Dr. Srijoy Mahapatra, the status of ventricular tachycardia ablation is growing at a 14-17% compound annual growth rate due to the fact that ablation of ventricular tachycardia may help patients feel better and live longer, despite the risks, including the occurrence of stroke, and the modest success rates. The success of ventricular tachycardia ablation varies, depending on the patient’s specific heart condition that caused ventricular tachycardia. The procedure is most effective in patients with otherwise normal hearts, in whom the success rate exceeds 90%. In patients with structural heart disease resulting from scar or cardiomyopathy, success rates range between 50% and 75% at six to 12 months. In cases in which a patient experiences a recurrence, two of three patients will still have less ventricular tachycardia than before the initial ablation (Circulation (2010) 122: e389-e391). Therefore, we believe that ablation will continue to become a preferred treatment for ventricular tachycardia, especially considering the challenges presented by ICD therapies; this increase in demand for ablation procedures will likely also increase the demand for technological advances in medical devices essential to ablation procedures, including electrophysiology recorders, in order to better support ablation procedures.

Electrophysiology Lab Environment and Electrophysiology Recording Systems
 
The electrophysiology lab environment and recording systems create significant amounts of noise and artifacts during electrophysiology procedures.  Current surface and intracardiac recording systems typically consist of large workstations interconnected by a complex set of cables that contribute to significant amounts of noise during signal acquisition. Additional noise and artifacts generated from the electrophysiology lab equipment further hamper recordings of small electrophysiological potentials.  Preserving spaciotemporal (space and time) characteristics of the signal in a very challenging electrophysiology recording environment is a difficult task. To remove noise and artifacts, recorders that are currently on the market offer a family of low pass, high pass and notch filters, but these filters alter signal information context.
 
The shape and amplitude of electrocardiograms, unipolar and bipolar electrograms, and, consequently, reconstructed endocardial and epicardial maps, are influenced not only by electrophysiological and structural characteristics of the myocardial tissue involved, but with characteristics of the recording system.  Amplitude and morphology of electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals are significantly affected by filters used to remove noise.  Because of the number of amplitude and interval measurements made during an electrophysiology study, it is imperative that the recording system faithfully acquires surface electrocardiogram and intracardiac electrograms.  We believe that the recording systems that are currently available on the market are ineffective in preserving the optimal amount of original information contained in the cardiac signals.
 
In addition, the electrophysiology lab consists of sophisticated equipment that requires an electrophysiologist to mentally integrate information from a number of sources during procedures. There are numerous monitors in an electrophysiology lab that provide and display this variety of information. An electrophysiologist needs to evaluate the acquired cardiac signals and the patient’s responses to any induced arrhythmias during the procedure.  However, it is difficult for an electrophysiologist to synthesize the disparate information produced by the numerous monitors in the lab and calculate the real-time, three-dimensional orientation of the anatomy and the location of the recording and ablation catheters.  As the number of electrophysiology procedures increase, a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic ablation catheters are becoming more widely available and new highly specialized catheters are being developed.  In addition, remote robotic and magnetic navigation systems are being developed to address limitations of dexterity in controlling the catheter tip, especially during complex arrhythmia ablation procedures. We believe that, considering the improvements being made with respect to other equipment used in the electrophysiology lab and the continual increase of ablation procedures, the electrophysiology recorders currently available on the market are not sufficiently advanced with respect to the quality of their recordings to deliver adequate results.  We believe that the PURE EP System will be able to deliver superior quality of recordings that will allow it to successfully integrate with the other advanced equipment found in the electrophysiology lab.
 
The requirement for optimal signal integrity is further amplified during ablation treatments of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Presently, one of the main objectives of the atrial fibrillation ablation procedure is to precisely identify, ablate and eliminate pulmonary vein potentials; and one of the main objectives of the ventricular tachycardia procedure is to map the arrhythmia substrate and precisely identify, ablate and eliminate small abnormal potentials. The information provided by recorders is essential for an electrophysiologist to determine ablation strategy during termination of both pulmonary vein potentials and ventricular tachycardia.  Therefore, it is important that the recording system’s noise removal technique does not alter the appearance and fidelity of these potentials. As a result, it is necessary that any new signal processing technology preserves signal fidelity as much as possible during electrophysiology recordings; otherwise, the signals that are needed to guide the ablation procedures will be difficult to distinguish due to noise interference.

We intend to bring to the electrophysiology market the PURE EP System, an electrocardiogram/intracardiac recorder that will be coupled with an array of software tools intended for electrophysiology studies and procedures ranging from simple diagnostic tests to ablation for the most complex cases of arrhythmias.  We believe that this system will provide unique recording capabilities because we are developing it to allow precise, uninterrupted, real-time evaluations of electrocardiograms and electrograms, and allow electrophysiologists to obtain data that cannot be acquired from present day recorders.
 
The PURE EP System uses a combination of analog and digital signal processing to acquire and display cardiac data. Because our technology consists of proprietary hardware, software and algorithms, the original cardiac data is not distorted.  In addition, we are developing a library of software tools that are designed to be configured to fit the needs of electrophysiologists in different settings and/or for different arrhythmia treatments. With the software, the PURE EP System can be positioned to provide information that can be used by electrophysiologists to help guide the ablation catheter; shorten procedure times; and can reduce the complexity of maneuvers necessary for identifying ablation targets for various arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.  The PURE EP System is intended to be used in addition to existing electrophysiology recorders.  We believe that the less distorted cardiac data provided by the PURE EP System will increase the workload ability and enhance the capabilities of the typical electrophysiology laboratory.
 
Initial Analysis
 
According to S. J. Asirvatham, MD, et. al. (“Signals and Signal Processing for the Electrophysiologist,” Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol. (2011) 4:965-973), recording environments in a typical electrophysiology laboratory presents challenging situations.  S. J. Asirvatham, MD, et. al., state, “Successful mapping and ablation in the electrophysiology laboratory is critically dependent on acquiring multiple, low-amplitude, intracardiac signals in the presence of numerous sources of electric noise and interference and displaying these signals in an uncomplicated and clinically relevant fashion, with minimal artifacts. This represents a significant engineering challenge and, in real-life electrophysiology laboratory, is not always successful.”
 
To determine and validate the state of present electrophysiology recording technology in the field, we completed a detailed analysis of the effect of filters used by existing EP recorders to reduce noise on spaciotemporal characteristics of electrocardiograms and intracardiac electrograms. We used a custom-built electrocardiogram/intracardiac simulator with a database of various electrocardiogram signals combined with electrophysiology signals, along with waveforms from publicly available databases. The ability to faithfully reproduce database waveforms generated by an electrocardiogram/intracardiac simulator was tested using the PURE EP System and conventional electrophysiology recorders, the GE CardioLab and St. Jude EP-WorkMate.
 
We evaluated the signal quality (amplitude, morphology and duration) of the different recorders, along with the ability of the recorders to reduce noise level and remove baseline wander, which are the cardiac signals that have shifted from the isoelectric line (the base line of the signal tracing). The electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals subjected to the PURE EP System’s signal processing showed less baseline wander, noise and artifacts compared to the conventional electrophysiology recorders.  Further, spaciotemporal characteristics of signals were greatly distorted by the conventional electrophysiology system, particularly when a notch filter was used, as compared to the recording of the same spaciotemporal characteristics by the PURE EP System.  A notch filter is used to remove a specific frequency from the signal, especially either 60Hz in the U.S. and 50Hz in Europe, and can be implemented in hardware or software.
 
During our initial analysis, we did not subject the evaluation of the data produced by our technology to any third-party review, as would be required for the publication of a formal study.

Proof of Concept Testing
 
We developed the PURE EP System’s proof of concept unit, which is the version of the product prior to prototype. The proof of concept unit was designed using separate analog and digital boards to allow for easier debugging and to demonstrate single channel electrocardiogram and intracardiac acquisition capabilities. The proof of concept unit was built to (i) verify that the PURE EP System performs in line with our intended design of the product, (ii) validate a portion of the hardware design that we intend to use in the prototype, and (iii) verify the software used by the PURE EP System.  The main objectives of the proof of concept unit were to demonstrate that the system’s hardware and software have the ability to faithfully record small cardiac signals in an electrophysiology laboratory environment and to obtain initial performance results.
 
In the second and third quarters of 2013, we performed and finalized testing of our proof of concept unit by initially using an electrocardiogram/intracardiac simulator at our lab, and subsequently by obtaining pre-clinical recordings from the lab at the University of California at Los Angeles.  As part of the testing, we simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals on our proof of concept unit and GE’s CardioLab recording system. An identical signal was applied to the input of both systems and the monitor of our proof of concept unit was positioned next to the monitor of GE’s CardioLab recording system to allow for visual comparison. We believe that our proof of concept unit performed well as compared to GE’s CardioLab recording system, in that the electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals displayed on our proof of concept unit showed less baseline wander, noise and artifacts compared to signals displayed on GE’s CardioLab recording system.  However, because this was a proof of concept test, without any clearly established protocols, we cannot present this data for publication and we do not have any independent verification or peer review of these findings.
 
Subsequently, in the third quarter of 2013, we analyzed the results of our proof of concept unit to determine the final design of the PURE EP System prototype.  Because the proof of concept unit was designed to verify the capabilities of the main components of the PURE EP System, we established a list of tasks necessary to complete the prototype (which we intend to use for end-user preference studies, additional pre-clinical studies and research studies), which has since been completed.

Prototype Testing
 
After conducting research of peer-reviewed EP publications (see Initial Analysis in Our Products section below), we contacted Samuel J. Asirvatham. M.D. (who we believed to be an expert in the field of signal-based catheter ablation), at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Since the end of 2014, we have collaborated with Dr. Asirvatham and other physicians affiliated with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida. We have performed pre-clinical studies at Mayo Clinic since 2015 to validate technology within the PURE EP System prototype. These studies have been designed to determine clinical effectiveness for features within the PURE EP System that are in development. Since March 2016, we have published seven manuscripts in collaboration with the physicians from Mayo Clinic evidencing our pre-clinical findings. The publications cover a variety of subjects pertaining to the PURE EP System as an enhanced electrophysiology recording system with signal acquisition and differentiation and having specific visualization of different electrophysiology signals.

Technology and Development Plan
 
Our technology team consists of six engineers and a consulting firm with expertise in digital signal processing, low power analog and digital circuit design, software development, embedded system development, electromechanical design, testing and system integration, and the regulatory requirements for medical devices. We have also entered into collaboration agreements with advisors and medical institutions in the fields of cardiology and electrophysiology, including Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, NY and the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute in Austin, TX (see “–Strategic Alliances”).  We envision outsourcing manufacturing of the complete PURE EP System.
 
We conducted our first three pre-clinical studies in 2015 at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  We have continued additional pre-clinical studies as part of an advanced research program since June 2016 at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota with the PURE EP System prototype. We also conducted a pre-clinical study at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, NY with emphasis on the VT model.
 
In the third quarter of 2017, in collaboration with Health Research International, we conducted a detailed survey of U.S. electrophysiologists to gather opinions on the main features of the PURE EP System. 
 
We intend to continue further pre-clinical studies at Mayo Clinic and we intend to begin a pre-clinical study at the Cardiac Arrhythmia Center at the University of California at Los Angeles.  We intend to conduct further pre-clinical studies, and research studies. The main objective of these studies is to demonstrate the clinical potential of the PURE EP System.

We have initiated technology development with Minnetronix, a medical technology and innovation company, and engaged Quintain Project Solutions LLC as the manufacturing project management leader for the PURE EP System – implementing steps for obtaining 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the PURE EP System.
 
We believe that by the conclusion of 2018, we will have obtained 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA and will be able to commence marketing and commercialization of the PURE EP System. Our ability to achieve the aforementioned milestones will be principally determined by our ability to obtain necessary financing and regulatory approvals, among other factors.
 
We have chosen and are working with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) as our Notified Body to obtain the CE Mark. CE marking is a mandatory approval for medical devices sold in Europe and Canada.  We plan on submitting for CE Mark in 2019.
 
Because we are a development stage company, with our initial product under development, we currently do not have any customers. We anticipate that our initial customers will be hospitals and other health care facilities that operate electrophysiology labs.
 
 Competition
 
The electrophysiology market is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. There are currently four large companies that share the majority of the electrophysiological recording market share. They produce the following electrophysiology recording systems, each with a unit price of approximately $250,000 per unit:

● | GE Healthcare’s family of CardioLab Recording Systems were initially developed in the early 1990s by Prucka Engineering, which was acquired by General Electric Company in 1999. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The LabSystem PRO EP Recording System was originally designed in the late 1980s by C.R. Bard. C.R. Bard’s electrophysiology business was acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation in 2013. 
● | Siemens AG developed the Axiom Sensis XP in 2002. 
● | St. Jude Medical, Inc.’s EP-WorkMate Recording System was acquired from EP MedSystems, Inc. in 2008, which had received clearance for the product from the FDA in 2003. In January 2017, Abbott Laboratories acquired St Jude Medical, Inc.



Based upon our analysis of data taken from patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and 510(k) approval applications filed with the FDA, we believe that the above recording systems are built on relatively old technologies and all use the identical approach in applying digital filters to remove noise and artifacts. We are of the opinion that such an approach sacrifices cardiac signal fidelity and, in the case of ablation; the filters have a direct impact on the ablation strategy of an electrophysiologist. The imprecise method to remove noise and artifacts used by the old recorders could be a contributing factor to the multiple (or repeated) ablation procedures that are frequently required in order to completely cure patients from atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. We are not currently aware of any other companies that are developing new recording technology for electrophysiology recorders.
 
Suppliers
 
The PURE EP System contains proprietary hardware and software modules that are assembled into the system. Hardware boards contain components that are available from different distributors. The parts used to manufacture analog and digital boards are readily available from a number of distributors or manufacturers. We obtained components from various suppliers and have assembled our first prototype in-house. We envision outsourcing manufacturing of the complete PURE EP System.

Research and Development Expenses
 
Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 were $4,756,468 and $2,654,501, respectively.
 
Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
 
We plan to implement a market development program prior to launch of our PURE EP System. As the product progresses through development and testing, we intend to gather the data produced by the PURE EP System’s processing and presenting electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals and use such data for posters, presentations at cardiology conferences, and, if appropriate, submissions to scientific journals. We believe that as we gather additional data from our existing proof of concept tests and our planned pre-clinical and clinical studies and user preference studies, we will be able to better determine the focus of our marketing efforts. We also plan to leverage our relationships with cardiac research and treatment centers to gain early product evaluation and validation. We believe that through these efforts, we may be able to gain preliminary acceptance of our PURE EP product by experienced professionals and academics in the electrophysiology field.
 
We also intend to simultaneously develop a branding strategy to introduce and support the PURE EP System. The strategy may include our presence at major relevant cardiology meetings on a national and regional basis to engage and educate physicians concerning the PURE EP System and any of our other products, as well as engaging in a variety of other direct marketing methods. We also intend to develop a small direct sales force together with a distribution network that has existing relationships with hospitals and electrophysiologists. We believe that we may be able to begin targeted commercial sales of the PURE EP System in the second half of 2018.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to establish and maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. Our co-founder and former chief technology officer, Budimir S. Drakulic, Ph.D., conceived of the proprietary elements of the PURE EP System in 2009 and 2010. We filed a patent application with the USPTO in December 2013 directed at systems and methods for the evaluation of electrophysiology systems. In March 2014, the inventors listed on the patent application filed in December 2013 assigned all of their rights to the patent application to us. In December 2014, we filed this patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) with the U.S. Receiving Office.  Our patent application filed in December 2013 represents a significant portion of our core proprietary intellectual property. Our patent application filed in December 2013 describes a system that can show comparative output of any two cardiac signal systems—such as the PURE EP System as compared to a competitor system, thus showing the value of the PURE EP System.
 
This patent application describes signal processing evaluators that assess how well a cardiac signal system reading a cardiac signal (such as the PURE EP System or another system) filters out noise, such as non-cardiac signals or other body-generated artifacts. Such noise is filtered by such systems with varying success, thus, an evaluator such as described in the patent application may be used to provide comparison data for a particular system versus another given the same or similar input. The patent application also describes a simulator that can send a simulated signal to a cardiac signal system (the PURE EP System or another system) in order to challenge such cardiac signal system to filter out typical noise. These are adjunct technologies that can be used to show the value of the PURE EP System as compared to other systems existing in the market. The additional patent applications that we intend to file in the U.S. in the future are expected to represent portions of the hardware and software technology associated with our PURE EP System, which technology includes a cardiac signal system that reads cardiac signals and filters such cardiac signals from noise such as non-cardiac signals or other body-generated artifacts. Upon filing of such patent applications, we believe that the novel aspects of our PURE EP System should be subject to pending patent application; however, we cannot be assured that all of the patents related to our patent applications, if any, will be granted.
 
In November 2017, we engaged 3LP Advisors LLC dba Sherpa Technology Group as our Intellectual Property Advisor.

Trademarks
 
Our trademark for “BIOSIG TECHNOLOGIES”; was registered on April 25, 2017. Our trademark for “PURE EP”; was registered on January 26, 2016.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our solutions include software and hardware which will be used for patient diagnosis and, accordingly, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations govern, among other things, the following activities that we perform and will continue to perform in connection with:

● | Product design and development; 
--+---------------------------------------------
● | Product testing; 
● | Product manufacturing; 
● | Product labeling and packaging; 
● | Product handling, storage, and installation;
● | Pre-market clearance or approval; 
● | Advertising and promotion; and 
● | Product sales, distribution, and servicing. 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies all medical devices into one of three classes.  Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a pre-market notification, known as a PMN, and a 510(k) approval, requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the U.S.  Class III devices are devices which must be approved by the pre-market approval process.  These tend to be devices that are permanently implanted into a human body or that may be necessary to sustain life.  For example, an artificial heart meets both these criteria.  Based on analysis of predicate devices, we believe that our products will be classified as Class II. Pursuant to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, Class II devices include a programmable diagnostic computer, which is a device that can be programmed to compute various physiologic or blood flow parameters based on the output from one or more electrodes, transducers, or measuring devices; this device includes any associated commercially supplied programs.  Because the PURE EP System is a surface electrocardiogram and intracardiac multichannel recording and analysis system that acquires, processes and displays electrocardiogram and electrograms, we believe it will be classified as a Class II device.  We must, therefore, first receive a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our PURE EP System before we can commercially distribute it in the U.S.  In the event that our PURE EP System is classified as a Class III device, which we believe is unlikely to occur, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory approval process and the subsequent commercialization of our product will require significantly greater time and resources than if it is classified as a Class II device, which would require us to reassess our strategic business plan of operations.
510(k) Clearance Process
 
For our PURE EP System, we must submit a pre-market notification to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes three to six months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but it can take significantly longer. A device that reaches market through the 510(k) process is not considered to be “approved” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They are generally referred to as “cleared” or “510(k) cleared” devices.  Nevertheless, it can be marketed and sold in the U.S.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a pre-market approval, which requires more data and is generally a significantly longer process than the 510(k) clearance process.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a pre-market approval is obtained.
 
Pervasive and continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulation
 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
 
 
● | Quality System regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Establishment Registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices intended for commercial distribution in the U.S. to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; 
● | Medical Device Listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; 
● | Labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.



Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:
 
 
● | Fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 
● | Administrative detention or banning of our products; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | Refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new product versions;
● | Revocation of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and 
● | Criminal penalties.

International Regulation
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, and the requirements may differ significantly.
 
The European Union has adopted legislation, in the form of directives to be implemented in each member state, concerning the regulation of medical devices within the European Union. The directives include, among others, the European Union Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices, as amended) (the “Medical Device Directive”) that establishes standards for regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and vigilance reporting for medical devices. Our PURE EP system may be affected by this legislation. Under the Medical Device Directive, medical devices are classified into four classes, I, IIa, IIb, and III, with class I being the lowest risk and class III being the highest risk. Under the Medical Device Directive, a competent authority is nominated by the government of each member state to monitor and ensure compliance with the Medical Device Directive. The competent authority of each member state then designates a notified body to oversee the conformity assessment procedures set forth in the Medical Device Directive, whereby manufacturers demonstrate that their devices comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Directive and are entitled to bear the CE mark. CE is an abbreviation for Conformité Européenne (or European Conformity) and the CE mark, when placed on a product, indicates compliance with the requirements of the applicable directive. Medical devices properly bearing the CE mark may be commercially distributed throughout the European Union. Failure to obtain the CE mark will preclude us from selling the PURE EP System and related products in the European Union.
