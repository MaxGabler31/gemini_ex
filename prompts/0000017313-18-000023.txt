 Item 1.     Business
     ORGANIZATION
     Capital Southwest Corporation, which we refer to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “CSWC,” or the “Company” is an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized financing to middle market companies in a broad range of industry segments located primarily in the United States. Our common stock currently trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “CSWC.”
     We were organized as a Texas corporation on April 19, 1961.  Until September 1969, we operated as a small business investment company, or SBIC, licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.  At that time, we transferred to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest Venture Corporation, or CSVC, certain assets including our SBIC license.  CSVC was a closed-end, non-diversified investment company registered under the 1940 Act.  Effective June 14, 2016, CSVC was dissolved and its SBIC license was surrendered. All assets held in CSVC were transferred to us upon dissolution. Prior to March 30, 1988, we were registered as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act.  On that date, we elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act.  As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, we are allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or, pursuant to recent legislation, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under “Regulation as a Business Development Company—Senior Securities”) after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. 
     We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code. As such, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders as dividends. To continue to maintain our RIC status, we must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income.
     Capital Southwest Management Corporation, or CSMC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is our management company.  CSMC generally incurs all normal operating and administrative expenses, including, but not limited to, salaries and related benefits, rent, equipment and other administrative costs required for day-to-day operations.
     We also have a direct wholly-owned subsidiary that has been elected to be a taxable entity (the “Taxable Subsidiary”). The primary purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still allow us to satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of our gross income for federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. The Taxable Subsidiary is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income.
     On September 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off, which we refer to as the Share Distribution, of CSW Industrials, Inc., or CSWI. CSWI is now an independent publicly traded company. The Share Distribution was effected through a tax-free, pro-rata distribution of 100% of CSWI’s common stock to our shareholders. Each of our shareholders received one share of CSWI common stock for every one share of our common stock on the record date, September 18, 2015. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of CSWI common stock.
     Following the Share Distribution, we have maintained operations as an internally managed BDC and pursue a credit-focused investing strategy akin to similarly structured organizations. We intend to continue to provide capital to middle-market companies. We invest primarily in debt securities, including senior debt, second lien and subordinated debt, and may also invest in preferred stock and common stock alongside our debt investments or through warrants.

     OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS
     We are an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market, or LMM, companies and debt capital to upper middle market, or UMM, companies in a broad range of industry segments located primarily in the United States. Our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments.  Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in senior debt securities, secured by security interests in portfolio company assets, and in secured and unsecured subordinated debt securities. We also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities.

     We focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. We target senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity investments in LMM companies, as well as first and second lien syndicated loans in UMM companies. Our target LMM companies typically have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. Our UMM investments generally include syndicated first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million, and our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million.
     We seek to fill the financing gap for LMM companies, which, historically, have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms, including equity participation. Our ability to invest across a LMM company’s capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options. Providing customized financing solutions is important to LMM companies. We generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors, entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our investments. Our LMM debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company, as well as subordinated debt which may either be secured or unsecured subordinated loans. Our LMM debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. We also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our LMM portfolio companies. 
     Our investments in UMM companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date.
     We offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and provide them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts. Our obligation to offer to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies is consistent with our belief that providing managerial assistance to a portfolio company is important to its business development activities.
     Because we are internally managed, we do not pay external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio.
     Recent Developments
     On April 2, 2018, CSWC paid regular dividends declared on February 28, 2018 in the amount of $4.5 million, or $0.28 per share.
     On April 16, 2018 and May 11, 2018, CSWC entered into Incremental Assumption Agreements, which increased the total commitments under our senior secured credit facility, dated as of August 30, 2016 and amended as of November 16, 2017, or the Credit Facility, by $20 million and $10 million, respectively. The increases were executed under the accordion feature of the Credit Facility and increased total commitments from $180 million to $210 million.
     On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the application of the recently modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company will be decreased from 200% to 150%, effective April 25, 2019. The Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company’s issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, effective April 25, 2019.
     On June 1, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.29 dividend per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. The record date for the dividend is June 26, 2018. The payment date for the dividend is July 2, 2018.

 Our Business Strategy 
     Our business strategy is to achieve our investment objective of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and realizing capital appreciation from our equity and equity-related investments. We have adopted the following business strategies to achieve our investment objective:
· | Leveraging the Experience of Our Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive experience investing in and lending to middle market companies across changing market cycles. The members of our management team have diverse investment backgrounds, with prior experience at BDCs in the capacity of senior officers. We believe this extensive experience provides us with an in-depth understanding of the strategic, financial and operational challenges and opportunities of the middle market companies in which we invest. We believe this understanding allows us to select and structure better investments and to efficiently monitor and provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Applying Rigorous Underwriting Policies and Active Portfolio Management. Our senior management team has implemented rigorous underwriting policies that are followed in each transaction. These policies include a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio company’s competitive position, financial performance, management team operating discipline, growth potential and industry attractiveness, which we believe allows us to better assess the company’s prospects. After investing in a company, we monitor the investment closely, typically receiving monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements. Senior management, together with the deal team and accounting and finance departments, meets at least monthly to analyze and discuss in detail the company’s financial performance and industry trends. We believe that our initial and ongoing portfolio review process allows us to monitor effectively the performance and prospects of our portfolio companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Investing Across Multiple Companies, Industries, Regions and End Markets. We seek to maintain a portfolio of investments that is appropriately diverse among various companies, industries, geographic regions and end markets. This portfolio balance is intended to mitigate the potential effects of negative economic events for particular companies, regions, industries and end markets. However, we may from time to time hold securities of an individual portfolio company that comprise more than 5% of our total assets and/or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. For that reason, we are classified as a non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilizing Long-Standing Relationships to Source Deals. Our senior management team and investment professionals maintain extensive relationships with entrepreneurs, financial sponsors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, commercial bankers and other non-bank providers of capital who refer prospective portfolio companies to us. These relationships historically have generated significant investment opportunities. We believe that our network of relationships will continue to produce attractive investment opportunities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focusing on Underserved Markets. The middle market has traditionally been underserved. We believe that operating margin and growth pressures, as well as regulatory concerns, have caused many financial institutions to de-emphasize services to middle market companies in favor of larger corporate clients and more liquid capital market transactions. We also invest in securities that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. We believe these dynamics have resulted in the financing market for middle market companies being underserved, providing us with greater investment opportunities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on Established Companies. We generally invest in companies with established market positions, proven management teams with strong operating discipline, histories of generating revenues, and recurring cash flow streams. We believe that those companies generally possess better risk adjusted return profiles than earlier stage companies that are building their management teams and establishing their revenue base. We also believe that established companies in our target size range generally provide opportunities for capital appreciation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital Structures Appropriate for Potential Industry and Business Volatility. Our investment team spends significant time understanding the performance of both the target portfolio company and its specific industry throughout a full economic cycle. The history of each specific industry and target portfolio company will demonstrate a different level of potential volatility in financial performance. We seek to understand this dynamic
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

thoroughly and invest our capital at leverage levels in the capital structure that will remain within enterprise value and in securities that will receive interest payments if such downside volatility were to occur.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing Customized Financing Solutions. We offer a variety of financing structures and have the flexibility to structure our investments to meet the needs of our portfolio companies. Often we invest in senior and subordinated debt securities, coupled with equity interests. We believe our ability to customize financing structures makes us an attractive partner to middle market companies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      INVESTMENT CRITERIA AND OBJECTIVES
     Our investment team has identified the following investment criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective investment opportunities. However, not all of these criteria have been or will be met in connection with each of our investments:  
· | Companies with Positive and Sustainable Cash Flow: We generally seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Excellent Management: Management teams with a proven record of achievement, exceptional ability, unyielding determination and integrity. We believe management teams with these attributes are more likely to manage the companies in a manner that protects and enhances value. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Industry: We primarily focus on companies having competitive advantages in their respective markets and/or operating in industries with barriers to entry, which may help protect their market position. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Private Equity Sponsors: We focus on developing relationships with leading private equity firms in order to partner with these firms and provide them capital to support the acquisition and growth of their portfolio companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Appropriate Risk-Adjusted Returns: We focus on and price opportunities to generate returns that are attractive on a risk-adjusted basis, taking into consideration factors, in addition to the ones depicted above, including credit structure, leverage levels and the general volatility and potential volatility of cash flows. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We have an investment committee that is responsible for all aspects of our investment process relating to investments made by us.  The current members of the investment committee are Bowen Diehl, Chief Executive Officer, Michael Sarner, Chief Financial Officer, Douglas Kelley, Managing Director, Josh Weinstein, Managing Director, and David Brooks, Chairman of the Board. 
     Investment Process
     Our investment strategy involves a team approach, whereby our investment team screens potential transactions before they are presented to the investment committee for approval.  Transactions that are either above a certain hold size or outside our general investment policy will also be reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.  Our investment team generally categorizes the investment process into six distinctive stages:  
· | Deal Generation/Origination: Deal generation and origination is maximized through long-standing and extensive relationships with private equity firms, leveraged loan syndication desks, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, entrepreneurs, service providers such as lawyers and accountants, and current and former portfolio companies and investors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Screening: Once it is determined that a potential investment has met our investment criteria, we will screen the investment by performing preliminary due diligence, which could include discussions with the private equity firm, management team, loan syndication desk, etc. Upon successful screening of the proposed investment, the investment team makes a recommendation to move forward and prepares an initial screening memo for our investment committee. We then issue either a non-binding term sheet (in the case of a directly originated transaction), or submit an order to the loan syndication desk (in the case of a large-market syndicated loan transaction). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  6

 

    
· | Term Sheet: In a directly originated transaction, the non-binding term sheet will typically include the key economic terms of our investment proposal, along with exclusivity, confidentiality, and expense reimbursement provisions, among other terms relevant to the particular investment. Upon acceptance of the term sheet, we will begin our formal due diligence process. In a syndicated loan transaction, rather than a formal term sheet, we will submit an order for an allocation to the syndicated loan desk. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Due Diligence: Due diligence is performed under the direction of our senior investment professionals, and involves our entire investment team as well as certain external resources, who together perform due diligence to understand the relationships among the prospective portfolio company’s business plan, operations, financial performance, and legal risks. On our directly originated transactions, our due diligence will often include (1) conducting site visits with management and key personnel; (2) performing a detailed review of historical and projected financial statements, often with a third-party accounting firm, to evaluate the target company’s normalized cash flow; (3) creating our own detailed modeling projections, including a downside case which attempts to project how the business would perform in a recession based on past operating history of either the company or the industry (4) interviewing key customers and suppliers; (5) evaluating company management, including a formal background check; (6) reviewing material contracts; (7) conducting an industry, market and strategy analysis; and (8) obtaining a review by legal, environmental or other consultants. In instances where a financial sponsor is investing in the equity in a transaction, we will leverage work done by the financial sponsor for purposes of our due diligence. In syndicated loan transactions, our due diligence may exclude direct customer and supplier interviews, and will consist of a detailed review of reports from the financial sponsor or syndication agent for industry and market analysis, and legal and environmental diligence. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Document and Close: Upon completion of a satisfactory due diligence review, our investment team presents its written findings to the investment committee. For transactions that are either over a certain hold size, or outside our general investment policy, the investment team will present the transaction to our Board of Directors for approval. Upon approval for the investment, we re-confirm our regulatory company compliance, process and finalize all required legal documents and fund the investment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Post-Investment: We continuously monitor the status and progress of our portfolio companies, as well as our investment thesis developed at the time of investment. We offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and provide them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts. The same investment team leader that was involved in the investment process will continue to be involved in the portfolio company post-investment. This approach provides continuity of knowledge and allows the investment team to maintain a strong business relationship with the financial sponsor, business owner and key management of our portfolio companies. As part of the monitoring process, members of our investment team will analyze monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements against previous periods, review financial projections, meet with the financial sponsor and management (when necessary), attend board meetings (when appropriate) and review all compliance certificates and covenants. Our investment team meets once each month with senior management to review the performance of each of our portfolio companies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance and monitor the expected level of returns for each debt investment in our portfolio.  The investment rating system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein, including each investment’s expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants and the portfolio company’s future outlook.  The ratings are not intended to reflect the performance or expected level of returns of our equity investments.
    
· | Investment Rating 1 represents the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment is performing materially above underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Investment Rating 2 indicates the investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable to neutral.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Investment Rating 3 involves an investment performing below underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to negative. The portfolio company or investment may be out of compliance with 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  7

 

financial covenants and interest payments may be impaired, however principal payments are generally not past due.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Investment Rating 4 indicates that the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations, the trends and risk factors are generally negative and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. Interest and principal payments on our investment are likely to be impaired. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Determination of Net Asset Value and Portfolio Valuation Process
     We determine our net asset value, or NAV, per share on a quarterly basis.  The NAV per share is equal to our total assets minus liabilities divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.
     We determine in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) and a valuation process approved by our Board of Directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio.
     We undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments.  The valuation process is led by the finance department in conjunction with the investment teams and senior management.  Valuations of each portfolio security are prepared quarterly by the finance department using updated portfolio company financial and operational information.  Each investment valuation is also subject to review by the executive officers and investment teams.  
     In conjunction with the internal valuation process, we have engaged multiple independent consulting firms that specialize in financial due diligence, valuation and business advisory services to provide third-party valuation reviews of the majority of our investments on a quarterly basis.  Our Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value of each investment in our portfolio.  
     COMPETITION
     We compete for attractive investment opportunities with other financial institutions, including BDCs, junior capital lenders, and banks. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team and our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes.  However, many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  Furthermore, our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and many have access to funding sources that are not available to us.  In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and build their market shares.  Likewise, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and valuation requirements that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.”
    
We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, because of this competition, we may be unable to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may be unable to identify and make investments that satisfy our investment objectives or meet our investment goals.

 LEVERAGE
    
We may from time to time borrow funds to make investments, a practice known as “leverage,” in an attempt to increase returns to our shareholders. With certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as calculated in accordance with the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or, pursuant to recent legislation, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under “Regulation as a Business Development Company—Senior Securities”) after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ at any particular time will depend on management’s and our Board of Directors’ assessments of portfolio mix, prevailing market advance rates and other market factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Structure – Because we borrow money to make investments, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.” 
     We intend to continue borrowing under the Credit Facility in the future and we may increase the size of the Credit Facility, add additional credit facilities or otherwise issue additional debt securities or other evidences of indebtedness in the future, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.
     See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources" as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 for information regarding the Credit Facility and the issuance of the December 2022 Notes.
     BROKERAGE ALLOCATION AND OTHER PRACTICES
     Since we generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, we infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. Our investment team is primarily responsible for the execution of the publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. We do not expect to execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but will seek to obtain the best net results for us, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While we will generally seek reasonably competitive trade execution costs, we will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, we may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to us. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if we determine in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided. We did not pay any brokerage commissions during the three years ended March 31, 2018.      DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
     We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our shareholders. Under the DRIP, if we declare a dividend, registered shareholders who have opted into the DRIP as of the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock. The share requirements of the DRIP are satisfied through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP plan administrator. Shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP plan administrator, before any associated brokerage or other costs.     ELECTION TO BE REGULATED AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
     We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC. Our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes have a significant impact on our operations. Some of the most important effects on our operations of our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC are outlined below. 
· | We report our investments at market value or fair value with changes in value reported through our consolidated statements of operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we report all of our investments, including debt investments, at market value or, for investments that do not have a readily available market value, at their “fair value” as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Changes in these values

are reported through our consolidated statements of operations under the caption of “net change in unrealized appreciation on investments.” See “Determination of Net Asset Value and Portfolio Valuation Process” above.
    
· | We intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our shareholders. We generally will be required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income we do not distribute to shareholders (actually or constructively).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As a RIC, so long as we meet certain minimum distribution, source of income and asset diversification requirements, we generally are required to pay U.S. federal income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income. We intend to distribute to our shareholders substantially all of our income. We may, however, make deemed distributions to our shareholders of any retained net long-term capital gains. If this happens, our shareholders will be treated as if they received an actual distribution of the net capital gains and reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in us. Our shareholders also may be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to their allocable share of the corporate-level U.S. federal income tax we pay on the deemed distribution. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” We met the minimum distribution requirements for tax years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code.    
     In addition, we have a Taxable Subsidiary that holds a portion of one or more of our portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiary is consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, so that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiary. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of our gross income for federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiary, a proportionate amount of any gross income of a partnership or LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to us. To the extent that such income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause us to incur significant amounts of corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. Where interests in LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiary, the income from those interests is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiary and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC status and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense as a result of its ownership of the portfolio companies. This income tax expense, if any, is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    
· | Our ability to use leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments is limited.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities of at least 200% (or, pursuant to recent legislation, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under “Regulation as a Business Development Company—Senior Securities”). For this purpose, senior securities include all borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future. Additionally, our ability to utilize leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments may be limited by this asset coverage test. While the use of leverage may enhance returns if we meet our investment objective, our returns may be reduced or eliminated if our returns on investments are less than the costs of borrowing. 
    
· | We are required to comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As a BDC, we are required to have a majority of directors who are not “interested persons” as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we are required to comply with other applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, including those requiring the adoption of a code of ethics, maintaining a fidelity bond and placing and maintaining its securities and similar investments in custody. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company” below.

     Regulation as a Business Development Company
     We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act.  The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates and principal underwriters as well as their respective affiliates.  The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the members of the board of directors of a BDC be persons other than “interested persons,” as defined in the 1940 Act.  In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
     The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of holders present or represented by proxy at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (2) more than 50% of our voting securities.
     The following is a brief description of the 1940 Act provisions applicable to BDCs, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 1940 Act and rules issued thereunder by the SEC.
    
· | Generally, BDCs must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance available to certain portfolio companies. In general, as a BDC, a company must, among other things: (1) be a domestic company; (2) have registered a class of its securities pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act; (3) operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of eligible portfolio companies, including early stage or emerging companies and businesses suffering or just recovering from financial distress (see following paragraph); (4) offer to make available significant managerial assistance to such portfolio companies; and (5) file a proper notice of election with the SEC. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An eligible portfolio company generally is a domestic company that is not a regulated or private investment company or a financial company (such as brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies and investment banking firms) and that: (1) does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; (2) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange with an equity market capitalization of less than $250 million; or (3) is controlled by the BDC itself or together with others and, as a result of such control, the BDC has an affiliated person on the board of directors of the company. The 1940 Act presumes that a person has “control” of a portfolio company if that person owns at least 25% of its outstanding voting securities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As a BDC, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable insurance company to protect against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from any act or omission constituting willful malfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of that person’s office. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Qualifying Assets
     The 1940 Act provides that we may not make an investment in non-qualifying assets unless at the time of the investment at least 70% of the value of our total assets (measured as of the date of our most recently filed financial statements) consists of qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include: (1) securities of eligible portfolio companies; (2) securities of certain companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time we initially acquired their securities and in which we retain a substantial interest; (3) securities of certain controlled companies; (4) securities of certain bankrupt, insolvent or distressed companies; (5) securities received in exchange for or distributed in or with respect to any of the foregoing; and (6) cash items, U.S. government securities and high-quality short-term debt.  
    
 
  11

 

 Significant Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
    
As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to the issuer whose securities we consider qualifying assets. 
     Temporary Investments
     Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, short-term investments in secured debt investments, independently rated debt investments and diversified bond funds, which we refer to as temporary investments.     Senior Securities
     We are generally permitted by the 1940 Act, under specific conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined by the 1940 Act, is at least 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur by reducing the minimum asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150%, if certain requirements are met. Under the requirements of the legislation, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity if shareholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive shareholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the legislation allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, but such approval would not become effective until the one-year anniversary of the approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to our use of leverage. As of March 31, 2018, we had $40.0 million and $57.5 million in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility and December 2022 Notes, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, our asset coverage was 416%.
     On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the application of the recently modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company will be decreased from 200% to 150%, effective April 25, 2019. The Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company’s issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, effective April 25, 2019.
     In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our shareholders or the repurchasing of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.  Under specific conditions, we are also permitted by the 1940 Act to issue warrants.
     Common Stock
     As a BDC, the 1940 Act generally limits our ability to issue and sell our common stock at a price below our NAV per share, exclusive of any distributing commission or discount, without shareholder approval. Shares of our common stock have traded below our NAV per share. While our common stock continues to trade at a price below our NAV per share, there are no assurances that we can issue or sell shares of our common stock if needed to fund our business. 
     Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct
     We adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions.  Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as those investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. We have also adopted a code of conduct that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer (or persons performing similar functions), our Board, and all other employees. This code sets forth policies that these executives and employees must follow when performing their duties.
     Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
    
 
  12

 

 We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in a manner in which we believe is consistent with the best interest of our shareholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we generally vote against proposals that we expect would have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. Our proxy voting decisions are made by the investment team that is responsible for monitoring the investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that anyone involved in the decision-making process discloses to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict of which he or she is aware. Shareholders may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Financial Officer c/o Capital Southwest Corporation, 5400 Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway, Suite 1300, Dallas, Texas 75240.         Compliance Policies and Procedures
     We have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures. Michael S. Sarner serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.     Exemptive Relief
    
On October 26, 2010, we received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting us to issue restricted stock to our executive officers and certain key employees, or the Original Order. On August 22, 2017, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the Original Order, or the Exemptive Order, and in addition to the relief granted under the Original Order, allows us to withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock granted pursuant to the 2010 Restricted Stock Award Plan, or the 2010 Plan, and to pay the exercise price of options to purchase shares of our common stock granted pursuant to the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan.     Other
    
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The prior approval of the SEC is not required, however, where a transaction involves no negotiation of terms other than price.
    
We expect to periodically be examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
     MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
     The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to us or to investors in such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, U.S. shareholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who mark-to-market our shares and persons who hold our shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge” or “conversion” transaction. This summary assumes that investors hold shares of our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
    
 
  13

 

 For purposes of our discussion, a “U.S. shareholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
    
· | A citizen or individual resident of the United States;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | A corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof of the District of Columbia;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      For purposes of our discussion, a “Non-U.S. shareholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. shareholder nor a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
     If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “partnership”) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner or member of the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partnership. A prospective shareholder that is a partner or member in a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock.
     Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.
     Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
     Election to be Taxed as a RIC
     We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our shareholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes. 
     Taxation as a RIC
     Provided that we qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which we define as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to shareholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.
     We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, 

 
  14

 
(2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one year period ended October 31 and (3) any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
     In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
    
· | Meet the Annual Distribution Requirement;
--+------------------------------------------


· | Qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code), or the 90% Income Test; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly traded partnership”); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (1) of one issuer (2) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (3) of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests.
     In order to meet the 90% Income Test, we have established the Taxable Subsidiary to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividend, interest or other income under the 90% Income Test. We may establish additional subsidiaries for the same purpose in the future. Any investments held through a Taxable Subsidiary generally are subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments.
     We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (including debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount or payment-in-kind interest that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.
     Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement necessary to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment under 

 
  15

 
the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
     Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test, such as cancellation of indebtedness income in connection with the work-out of a leveraged investment (which, while not free from doubt, may be treated as non-qualifying income) or the receipt of other non-qualifying income.
     Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
     Investments by us in non-U.S. securities may be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes, and therefore, our yield on any such securities may be reduced by such non-U.S. taxes. Shareholders will generally not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us.
     We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company” above. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
     If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our shareholders. In that case, all of such income will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our shareholders. See “Failure To Obtain RIC Tax Treatment” below.
     As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our investment company taxable income in other taxable years. U.S. federal income tax law generally permits a RIC to carry forward (1) the excess of its net short-term capital loss over its net long-term capital gain for a given year as a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year and (2) the excess of its net long-term capital loss over its net short-term capital gain for a given year as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year. Future transactions we engage in may cause our ability to use any capital loss carryforwards, and unrealized losses once realized, to be limited under Section 382 of the Code. Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (2) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (3) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (4) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (5) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (6) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (7) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions.
     As described above, to the extent that we invest in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of such investments for purposes of the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests will depend on whether or not the partnership is a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code). If the entity is a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” the net income derived from such investments will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and will be “securities” for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the entity is not treated as a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” however, the consequences of an investment in the partnership will depend upon the amount and type of income and assets of the partnership allocable to us. The income derived from such investments may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and, therefore, 

 
  16

 
could adversely affect our qualification as a RIC. We intend to monitor our investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification as a RIC.
     We may invest in preferred securities or other securities the U.S. federal income tax treatment of which may not be clear or may be subject to re-characterization by the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the expected tax treatment, it could affect the timing or character of income recognized, requiring us to purchase or sell securities, or otherwise change our portfolio, in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to RICs under the Code.
     We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each shareholder. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of shareholders are treated as taxable dividends. The IRS has issued a revenue procedure indicating that this rule will apply where the total amount of cash to be distributed is not less than 20% of the total distribution. Under this revenue procedure, if too many shareholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, each such shareholder would receive a pro rata share of the total cash to be distributed and would receive the remainder of their distribution in shares of stock. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this revenue procedure that are payable in part in our stock, taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. If a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock.
     Failure to Obtain RIC Tax Treatment
     If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for that year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets).
     If we were unable to obtain tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to shareholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our shareholders as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (in the case of non-corporate U.S. shareholders, generally at a maximum federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income of 20%). Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.
     If we fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years, and then seek to re-qualify as a RIC, we would be subject to corporate-level taxation on any built-in gain recognized during the succeeding 5-year period unless we made a special election to recognize all that built-in gain upon our re-qualification as a RIC and to pay the corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on that built-in gain.
     Taxation of U.S. Shareholders
     Whether an investment in shares of our common stock is appropriate for a U.S. shareholder will depend upon that person’s particular circumstances. An investment in shares of our common stock by a U.S. shareholder may have adverse tax consequences. The following summary generally describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in shares of our common stock by taxable U.S. shareholders and not by U.S. shareholders that are generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. U.S. shareholders should consult their own tax advisors before making an investment in our common stock.

 Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. shareholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” (which generally is our ordinary income excluding net capital gains) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. shareholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate U.S. shareholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, such distributions generally will be eligible for taxation at rates applicable to “qualifying dividends” at a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% provided that we properly report such distribution as “qualified dividend income” in a written statement furnished to our shareholders and certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied. In this regard, it is not anticipated that a significant portion of distributions paid by us will be attributable to qualifying dividends; therefore, our distributions generally will not qualify for the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Distributions of our net capital gains (which generally is our net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses) properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” will be taxable to a U.S. shareholder as long-term capital gains (at a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% in the case of individuals, trusts or estates), regardless of the U.S. shareholder’s holding period for his, her or its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in such shareholder’s common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gain to such U.S. shareholder.
     In lieu of actually distributing our realized net capital gains, we may retain some or all of our long-term capital gain and elect to be deemed to have made a distribution of the retained portion to our shareholders (a “deemed distribution”) under the “designated undistributed capital gains” rule of the Code. In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. shareholder will be required to include his, her or its proportionate share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. shareholder, and the U.S. shareholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to his, her or its allocable share of the tax paid thereon by us. The amount of the deemed distribution, net of such tax, will be added to the U.S. shareholder’s tax basis for his, her or its common stock. If the amount of U.S. federal income tax credit received by a shareholder exceeds the U.S. federal income tax such shareholder owes on the retained net capital gain, such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. shareholder’s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a shareholder’s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A shareholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our shareholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a “deemed distribution.”
     For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. shareholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in any such month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. shareholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared.
     If an investor purchases shares of our common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution, and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of his, her or its investment.
     A U.S. shareholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the shareholder sells or otherwise disposes of his, her or its shares of our common stock. The amount of gain or loss will be measured by the difference between such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock sold and the amount of the proceeds received in exchange. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gains or losses if the shareholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it will be classified as short-term capital gains or losses. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our common stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our common stock may be disallowed if other substantially identical shares are purchased (whether 

 
  18

 
through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. The ability to otherwise deduct capital losses may be subject to other limitations under the Code.
     In general, non-corporate U.S. shareholders, including individuals, trusts and estates, are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of 20% on their net capital gains, or the excess of realized net long-term capital gains over realized net short-term capital losses for a taxable year, including a long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. shareholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gains at the maximum 21% rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate shareholders with net capital losses for a year (which we define as capital loss in excess of capital gain) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each year; any net capital loss of a non-corporate shareholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent years as provided in the Code. Corporate shareholders generally may not deduct any net capital loss for a year, but may carry back such losses for three years or carry forward such losses for five years. 
     Certain U.S. shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts generally are subject to a 3.8% Medicare surtax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. shareholder’s “net investment income” (or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust) for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S shareholder’s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances). A U.S. shareholder’s net investment income generally includes its dividends on, and capital gain from the sale or other disposition of, shares of our common stock.
     A “publicly offered” RIC is a RIC whose shares are either (1) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering, (2) regularly traded on an established securities market or (3) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. If we are not a publicly offered RIC for any period, a non-corporate shareholder’s pro rata portion of our affected expenses, including our management fees, will be treated as an additional dividend to the shareholder and will be deductible by such shareholder only to the extent permitted under the limitations described below. For non-corporate shareholders, including individuals, trusts, and estates, significant limitations generally apply to the deductibility of certain expenses of a non-publicly offered RIC, including advisory fees. In particular, these expenses, referred to as miscellaneous itemized deductions, are deductible only to individuals to the extent they exceed 2% of such a shareholder’s adjusted gross income, and are not deductible for AMT purposes. These expenses are not deductible by U.S. shareholders for tax years beginning 2018 through 2025. Because we anticipate that shares of our common stock will continue to be regularly traded on an established securities market, we believe that we will continue to qualify as a “publicly offered regulated investment company.”
     We (or the applicable withholding agent) will send to each of our U.S. shareholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a written statement detailing the amounts includible in such U.S. shareholder’s taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the U.S. federal tax status of each year’s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the preferential tax rate applicable to qualifying dividends. Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. shareholder’s particular situation.
     We may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax, or backup withholding at a rate of 24%, from all taxable distributions to any U.S. shareholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such shareholder is exempt from backup withholding (e.g., because it is a corporation) or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual’s taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax, and any amount withheld may be refunded or credited against the U.S. shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS.
     Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of our stock of $2.0 million or more for an individual, S corporation, trust or a partnership with at least one non-corporate partner or $10.0 million or more for a shareholder that is either a corporation or a partnership with only corporate partners in any single taxable year (or a greater loss over a combination of years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886 (or successor form). Direct shareholders of portfolio securities in many cases are exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all RICs. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper.

Significant monetary penalties apply to a failure to comply with this reporting requirement. States may also have a similar reporting requirement. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.
     Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders
     Whether an investment in the shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. shareholder will depend upon that person’s particular circumstances. An investment in the shares by a Non-U.S. shareholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our common stock.
     Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” to Non-U.S. shareholders that are not “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. shareholder, will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, unless an applicable exception applies. No withholding is required with respect to distributions of (i) net U.S. source interest income that the Company properly reports as “interest-related dividends”, or (ii) net short term capital gains in excess of net long term capital losses that the Company properly reports as “short-term capital gain dividends.”  The Company anticipates that a portion of its distributions will be eligible for this exception from withholding; however, the Company cannot determine what portion of its distributions (if any) will be eligible for this exception until after the end of their taxable year. No certainty can be provided that any distributions will be reported as eligible for this exception.
     Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gain to a Non-U.S. shareholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. shareholder upon the sale of our common stock, that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. shareholder, will generally not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the Non-U.S. shareholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements. However, withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on capital gain of nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the United States for more than the 182 day period only applies in exceptional cases because any individual present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year is generally treated as a resident for U.S. income tax purposes; in that case, he or she would be subject to U.S. income tax on his or her worldwide income at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, rather than the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax.
     If we distribute our net capital gain in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a Non-U.S. shareholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the shareholder’s allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gain deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. shareholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. shareholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for a Non-U.S. shareholder.
     Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” and net capital gain (including deemed distributions) to Non-U.S. shareholders, and gain realized by Non-U.S. shareholders upon the sale of our common stock that is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. shareholder (or if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a “permanent establishment” in the United States), will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic corporations. Corporate Non-U.S. shareholders may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% imposed by the Code (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty). 
     The tax consequences to a Non-U.S. shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein. Non-U.S. shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in our shares.
     Non-U.S. shareholders may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. shareholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. shareholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. To claim a credit or refund for any taxes paid by the Company on any undistributed long-term capital gains 

 
  20

 
(as discussed above) or any taxes collected through withholding or to claim a benefit under an applicable tax treaty, a Non-U.S. shareholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and may be required to file a federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. shareholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. income tax return.
     Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the shares.

    FATCA
     Legislation commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” or “FATCA,” generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”) unless such FFIs either (i) enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by U.S. persons (or held by foreign entities that have U.S. persons as substantial owners) or (ii) reside in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) with the United States to collect and share such information and are in compliance with the terms of such IGA and any enabling legislation or regulations. The types of income subject to the tax include U.S. source interest and dividends and the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce U.S.- source interest or dividends received after December 31, 2018. The information required to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a U.S. person and transaction activity within the holder’s account. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, this legislation also imposes a 30% withholding on payments to foreign entities that are not FFIs unless the foreign entity certifies that it does not have a greater than 10% U.S. owner or provides the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than 10% U.S. owner. Depending on the status of a Non-U.S. shareholder and the status of the intermediaries through which they hold their shares, Non-U.S. shareholders could be subject to this 30% withholding tax with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the sale of their shares.  Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. shareholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.     Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Considerations
     Prospective investors should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock.     State and Local Tax Treatment
     The state and local tax treatment may differ from federal income tax treatment.
     The discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice, and potential investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax considerations relevant to their particular situation.     THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REGULATIONS
     The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, has adopted corporate governance listing standards with which listed companies must comply in order to remain listed.  We believe that we are in compliance with these corporate governance listing standards.
