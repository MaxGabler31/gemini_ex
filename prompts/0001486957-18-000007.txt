Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
BWX Technologies, Inc. is a specialty manufacturer of nuclear components, a developer of nuclear technologies and a service provider with an operating history of more than 100 years. Our core businesses focus on the design, engineering and manufacture of precision naval nuclear components, reactors and nuclear fuel for the U.S. Government. We also provide special nuclear materials processing and environmental site restoration services, as well as a variety of products and services to customers in the nuclear power industry. While we provide a wide range of products and services, our business segments are heavily focused on major projects. At any given time, a relatively small number of projects can represent a significant part of our operations.
On June 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off of our former Power Generation business (the "spin-off") into an independent, publicly traded company named Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. ("BWE"). The separation was effected through a pro rata distribution of 100% of BWE's common stock to BWXT's stockholders. The distribution consisted of one share of BWE common stock for every two shares of BWXT common stock to holders of our common stock on June 18, 2015. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of BWE common stock. BWXT did not retain any ownership interest in BWE following the spin-off. Concurrent with the spin-off, we changed our name to BWX Technologies, Inc. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol BWXT.
Prior to June 30, 2015, we completed an internal restructuring that reorganized the subsidiaries involved in our former Power Generation business and established BWE as the direct or indirect parent company of all those subsidiaries. The results of operations of our former Power Generation business are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income. We have presented the notes to our consolidated financial statements on the basis of continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.
Business Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: Nuclear Operations Group, Nuclear Services Group and Nuclear Power Group. Our reportable segments reflect changes we made during the first quarter of 2017 in the manner for which our segment operating information is reported for purposes of assessing operating performance and allocating resources. Prior to 2017, we reported three segments: Nuclear Operations, Nuclear Energy and Technical Services. The U.S. commercial nuclear services business, a component of our former Nuclear Energy segment, is now reported in our Nuclear Services Group segment along with our former Technical Services segment. The remainder of our former Nuclear Energy segment is now reported in our Nuclear Power Group segment, which comprises our Canadian operations, including BWXT Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., which we acquired in 2016. Our Nuclear Operations Group segment represents our former Nuclear Operations segment. The change in our reportable segments had no impact on our previously reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have applied the change in reportable segments to previously reported historical financial information and related disclosures included in this Report.
For financial information regarding each of our segments, financial information regarding geographic areas and additional information regarding the change to our segments, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. For further details regarding each segment's facilities, see Item 2, "Properties." In general, we operate in capital-intensive industries and rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of our revenues. We are currently exploring growth strategies across our segments through strategic investments and acquisitions to expand and complement our existing businesses. We would expect to fund these opportunities with cash on hand or by raising additional capital through debt, equity or some combination thereof.
1

Nuclear Operations Group
Through this segment, we engineer, design and manufacture precision naval nuclear components, reactors and nuclear fuel for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE")/National Nuclear Security Administration's ("NNSA") Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. In addition, we perform development and fabrication activities for missile launch tubes for U.S. Navy submarines.
Our Nuclear Operations Group segment specializes in the design and manufacture of close-tolerance and high-quality equipment for nuclear applications. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer of critical nuclear components, fuels and assemblies for government and limited other uses. We have supplied nuclear components for DOE programs since the 1950s and are the largest domestic supplier of research reactor fuel elements for colleges, universities and national laboratories. We also convert or downblend high-enriched uranium into low-enriched fuel for use in commercial reactors to generate electricity. In addition, we have over 100 years of experience in supplying components for defense applications.
We work closely with the DOE-supported nuclear non-proliferation program. Currently, this program is assisting in the development of a high-density, low-enriched uranium fuel required for high-enriched uranium test reactor conversions. We have also been a leader in the receipt, storage, characterization, dissolution, recovery and purification of a variety of uranium-bearing materials. All phases of uranium downblending and uranium recovery are performed at our Lynchburg, Virginia and Erwin, Tennessee sites.
The demand for nuclear components by the U.S. Government determines a substantial portion of this segment's backlog. We expect that orders for nuclear components will continue to be a significant part of backlog for the foreseeable future. In addition, the U.S. Navy issued its fiscal year 2019 long-range shipbuilding plan in February 2018, which includes recommendations to increase the size of its fleet of ships to include additional submarines and aircraft carriers beyond the number disclosed in previous long-range shipbuilding plan. We are evaluating the impact of the U.S. Navy's new shipbuilding plan and expect that it will require additional capital expenditures and investment in personnel to meet this growth in demand.
Nuclear Services Group
Through this segment, we provide various services to the U.S. Government, including special nuclear materials processing, environmental site restoration services and management and operating services for various U.S. Government-owned facilities. These services are provided primarily to the DOE, including the NNSA, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, and NASA.
This segment's principal operations include:

• | managing and operating environmental management sites;


• | managing spent nuclear fuel and transuranic waste for the DOE;


• | managing and operating nuclear production facilities;


• | providing critical skills and resources for DOE sites; and


• | managing and operating space flight hardware and test facilities for NASA.

This segment is also engaged in inspection and maintenance services for the commercial nuclear industry primarily in the U.S. These services include the inspection of steam generators and heat exchangers, high pressure water lancing, non-destructive examination and the development of customized tooling solutions. This segment also develops technology for a variety of applications, including advanced nuclear power sources, and offers complete advanced fuel and reactor engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for new advanced nuclear reactors.
Our Nuclear Services Group segment's overall activity depends on authorized spending levels of the DOE, including the NNSA, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, and NASA. We manage and operate complex, high-consequence nuclear and national security operations for the DOE and the NNSA, primarily through our joint ventures, as further discussed under the caption "Joint Ventures" below. In addition, this segment's activities associated with the U.S. commercial nuclear industry depend on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear power in the U.S. and our ability to successfully obtain commercial nuclear contracts.
2

Nuclear Power Group
Through this segment, we design and manufacture commercial nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, pressure vessels, reactor components and other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level nuclear waste. This segment is a leading supplier of nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, tooling delivery systems and related services for CANDU nuclear power plants. This segment also provides a variety of engineering and in-plant services and is a significant supplier to nuclear power utilities undergoing major refurbishment and plant life extension projects. Our in-depth knowledge comes from over 50 years of experience in the design, manufacturing, commissioning and service of nuclear power generation equipment.
This segment specializes in performing full scope, prototype design work coupled with manufacturing integration. The design, engineering and other capabilities of this segment include:

• | steam generation and separation equipment design and development;


• | thermal-hydraulic design of reactor plant components;


• | commercial nuclear fuel manufacturing and design;


• | nuclear fuel handling system design, manufacturing, delivery, installation and commissioning;


• | containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level waste;


• | structural and thermal-hydraulic design and vibration analysis for heat exchangers;


• | structural component design for precision manufacturing;


• | materials expertise in high-strength, low-alloy steels and nickel-based materials;


• | material procurement of tubing, forgings and weld wire; and


• | metallographic and chemical analysis.

Our Nuclear Power Group segment's overall activity primarily depends on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy. A significant portion of our Nuclear Power Group segment's operations depend on the timing of maintenance outages, principally in the Canadian market, and the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishments for nuclear utility customers, which could cause variability in our financial results.
Acquisitions
On December 16, 2016, our subsidiary BWXT Canada Ltd. acquired the outstanding stock of the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc. ("GEH-C") joint venture, which was renamed BWXT Nuclear Energy Canada Inc. ("NEC"). NEC is a leading supplier of nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, tooling delivery systems and replacement components for CANDU reactors and has approximately 350 employees. NEC operates two facilities licensed by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ("CNSC") to fabricate natural uranium fuel in Peterborough and Toronto, Ontario, Canada as well as a third facility in Arnprior, Ontario, Canada. The acquisition of NEC expanded our existing commercial nuclear products and services portfolio, allowing us to leverage our technology-based competencies in offering new products and services related to plant life extensions as well as the ongoing maintenance of nuclear power generation equipment. NEC is reported within our Nuclear Power Group segment.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information on the acquisition of NEC.
Special Charges for Restructuring Activities
In 2014, we began initiatives to restructure our mPower program and to improve margins in one of our former segments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred expenses of $15.9 million and $0.7 million related to these initiatives, respectively. Included in these expenditures were asset impairment charges and costs related to employee termination benefits and facility consolidation. These activities were substantially complete as of June 30, 2015.
mPower Framework Agreement
On March 2, 2016, we entered into a framework agreement with Bechtel Power Corporation ("Bechtel"), BWXT Modular Reactors, LLC and BDC NexGen Power, LLC, our partner in Generation mPower LLC ("GmP"), for the potential 
3

restructuring and restart of our mPower small modular reactor program (the "Framework Agreement"). As a result of entering into the Framework Agreement, we have deconsolidated GmP from our financial statements as of the date of the Framework Agreement. We recorded a gain of approximately $13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the deconsolidation of GmP as a component of Other – net on our consolidated statement of income.
In the year ended December 31, 2016, we also recognized a $30.0 million loss contingency as a result of the Framework Agreement, which was ultimately paid to Bechtel in the first quarter of 2017 following receipt of Bechtel's notice that the mPower program would not be restarted.
Contracts
We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price incentive fee, cost-plus, target price cost incentive, cost-reimbursable, fixed-price or some combination of these methods. We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accordingly, we review contract price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage of completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material.
We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices.
In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
For further specification, see "Risk Factors Related to Our Business – We are subject to risks associated with contractual pricing in our industries, including the risk that, if our actual costs exceed the costs we estimate on our fixed-price contracts, our profitability will decline, and we may suffer losses" as outlined in Item 1A of this Report.
Nuclear Operations Group
The majority of the revenue generated by this segment is from long-term contracts with the DOE/NNSA's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. Government in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") and the related U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS"). Examples of costs that may be incurred by us and not billable to the U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, unallowable employee compensation and benefit costs, lobbying costs, interest, certain legal costs and charitable donations.
Most of our contracts in this segment are fixed-price incentive fee contracts which provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a fee and generally require that we use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs. Award and incentive fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of our performance against negotiated criteria, primarily related to cost, and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance. Incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. Award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract.
Certain of our U.S. Government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons including, but not limited to, annual funding determinations. In addition, contracts between the U.S. Government and its prime contractors usually contain standard provisions for termination at the convenience of the U.S. Government or the prime contractor. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to federal regulations under which our right to receive future awards of new federal contracts would be unilaterally suspended or barred if we were convicted of a crime or indicted based on allegations of a violation of specific federal statutes. In addition, some of our contracts with the U.S. Government require us to provide advance notice in connection with any contemplated sale or shut down of the relevant facility. In each of those situations, the U.S. Government has an exclusive right to negotiate a mutually acceptable purchase of the facility.

Nuclear Services Group
This segment's principal operations include the management and operation of nuclear production facilities, environmental management sites and the management of spent nuclear fuel and transuranic waste for the DOE. These activities are primarily accomplished through our participation in joint ventures with other contractors as further discussed under the caption "Joint Ventures" below.
The contracts for the management and operation of U.S. Government facilities are awarded through a complex and protracted procurement process. These contracts are generally structured as five-year contracts with options for up to five additional years, which are exercisable by the customer, or include provisions whereby the contract durations can be extended as a result of the achievement of certain performance metrics. These are cost-reimbursement contracts with a U.S. Government credit line with some corporate-funded working capital required. However, many new contracts currently in the bidding process and recently awarded have a different structure. While these new contracts remain cost-reimbursement contracts, the contractor may be required to supply working capital and be reimbursed by the U.S. Government through regular invoicing. These contracts include a fee that is primarily based on performance, which is typically evaluated annually.
This segment also serves the commercial nuclear industry primarily through the use of fixed-price contracts that are awarded following a competitive bid process. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because the price has been pre-determined and is generally not subject to adjustment, regardless of costs incurred, unless authorized by the customer.
Nuclear Power Group
Contracts in this segment are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, plant or equipment availability, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, efficiency, safety record and reputation. The majority of these contracts are fixed-price contracts in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a pre-determined price that is generally not subject to adjustment, regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, unless changes in scope are authorized by the customer. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work.
Our arrangements with customers may require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve significant amounts for contract security.
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress. Not all of our expected revenue from a contract award is recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including that some projects are awarded and completed within the same fiscal quarter.
Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. Additionally, our backlog, and the expected recognition of revenue, is subject to change upon our adoption of FASB Topic Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018.
We are subject to the budgetary and appropriations cycle of the U.S. Government as it relates to our Nuclear Operations Group and Nuclear Services Group segments. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.
We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and a commitment from the customer to payment for work performed. Accordingly, we exclude from backlog orders or arrangements that have been awarded but for which we have not been authorized to begin performance.

Our backlog at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:

 | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
 | (In approximate millions)
Nuclear Operations Group | $ | 3,305 | | | 83 | % | | $ | 3,485 | | | 88 | %
Nuclear Services Group | 29 | | | 1 | % | | 24 | | | — | %
Nuclear Power Group | 637 | | | 16 | % | | 474 | | | 12 | %
Total Backlog | $ | 3,971 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 3,983 | | | 100 | %

We do not include the value of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts in backlog. These unconsolidated joint ventures are included in our Nuclear Services Group segment. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for financial information on our equity method investments.
Of the December 31, 2017 backlog, we expect to recognize revenues as follows:

 | 2018 | | 2019 | | Thereafter | | Total
 | (In approximate millions)
Nuclear Operations Group | $ | 1,190 | | | $ | 772 | | $ | 1,343 | $ | 3,305
Nuclear Services Group | 22 | | | 3 | | | 4 | | 29 
Nuclear Power Group | 230 | | | 111 | | | 296 | | 637 
Total Backlog | $ | 1,442 | | | $ | 886 | | $ | 1,643 | $ | 3,971

As of December 31, 2017, Nuclear Operations Group backlog with the U.S. Government was $3,299.2 million, $266.6 million of which had not yet been funded.
As of December 31, 2017, Nuclear Services Group backlog with the U.S. Government was $11.1 million, all of which was fully funded.
As of December 31, 2017, Nuclear Power Group had no backlog with the U.S. Government.
Major new awards from the U.S. Government are typically received following Congressional approval of the budget for the Government's next fiscal year, which starts October 1, and may not be awarded to us before the end of the calendar year. Due to the fact that most contracts awarded by the U.S. Government are subject to these annual funding approvals, the total values of the underlying programs are significantly larger. In April 2016, we were awarded a component and fuel contract, along with a three-year downblending contract by the U.S. Government with a combined value in excess of $3.0 billion, inclusive of unexercised options.
As of December 31, 2017, the U.S. Government had awarded us approximately $2.8 billion of the April 2016 award. The value of unexercised options excluded from backlog as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $0.2 billion, the majority of which is expected to be exercised in 2018, subject to annual Congressional appropriations.
Competition
The competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below.
Nuclear Operations Group. We have specialized technical capabilities that have allowed us to be a valued supplier of nuclear components and fuel for the U.S. Government's naval nuclear fleet since the 1950s. Because of the technical and regulatory standards required to meet U.S. Government contracting requirements for nuclear components and the barriers to entry present in this type of environment, competition in this segment is limited. The primary bases of limited competition for this segment are price, high capital investment, technical capabilities, high regulatory licensing costs and quality of products and services. In addition, a significant portion of the designs, processing and final product are classified by the U.S. Government, requiring applicable personnel to obtain and maintain U.S. Government security clearances.
Nuclear Services Group. Through this segment, we are engaged in the management and operation of U.S. Government facilities and the delivery of environmental remediation services (decontamination and decommissioning) associated with U.S. Government-owned nuclear facilities. Many of our government contracts are bid as a joint venture with one or more companies, in which we have a majority or a minority position. The performance of the prime or lead contractor can impact our 
6

reputation and our future competitive position with respect to that particular project and customer. Our primary competitors in the delivery of goods and services to the U.S. Government and the operation of U.S. Government facilities include, but are not limited to, Bechtel National, Inc., AECOM, Fluor Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., Honeywell International, Inc. and Leidos, Inc.

Foreign Operations
We have Canadian operations primarily in our Nuclear Power Group segment, which serve the North American and global nuclear utility markets. The functional currency of these operations is not the U.S. dollar, and, as a result, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Revenue and operating income derived from Canadian operations, as well as the approximate percentages of our total segment revenues and total segment operating income, respectively, for each of the last three years were as follows (dollars in thousands):

 | Revenues | | Operating Income
 | Amount | | Percent | Amount | | Percent
Year Ended December 31, 2017 | $ | 285,585 | | 17 | % | | $ | 39,719 | 12 | %
Year Ended December 31, 2016 | $ | 160,504 | | 10 | % | | $ | 42,808 | 14 | %
Year Ended December 31, 2015 | $ | 119,574 | | 8 | % | | $ | 11,803 | 4 | %

See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information on the geographic distribution of our revenues.
Customers
We provide our products and services to a diverse customer base, including the U.S. Government, utilities and other power producers. Our largest customer during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was the U.S. Government; U.S. Government contracts represented approximately 81%, 87% and 88% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively. No individual non-U.S. Government customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
8

The U.S. Government is the primary customer of our Nuclear Operations Group and Nuclear Services Group segments. Revenues from U.S. Government contracts comprised 99% of revenues in our Nuclear Operations Group segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Revenues from U.S. Government contracts comprised 83%, 76% and 70% of revenues in our Nuclear Services Group segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our operations use raw materials, such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. Our Nuclear Power Group segment does not depend on a single source of supply for materials used in our products. We have limited supply options for certain raw materials used in our Nuclear Power Group segment, however we believe the suppliers of these materials are reliable. Our Nuclear Operations Group segment relies on several single-source suppliers for materials used in its products. We believe these suppliers are reliable, and we and the U.S. Government expend significant effort to monitor and maintain the supplier base for our Nuclear Operations Group segment.
Although shortages of some raw materials have existed occasionally, no serious shortage exists at the present time.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 6,100 persons worldwide. Approximately 1,400 of our employees were members of labor unions at December 31, 2017. Many of our operations are subject to union contracts, which we customarily renew periodically. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
Patents and Technology Licenses
We currently hold a large number of U.S. and foreign patents and have patent applications pending. We acquire patents and technology licenses and grant licenses to others when we consider it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and technology licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how, rather than patents and technology licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development activities are related to the development and improvement of new and existing products and equipment, as well as conceptual and engineering evaluation for translation into practical applications. We charge the costs of research and development unrelated to specific contracts as incurred. Excluding customer-sponsored research and development, the majority of our activities in this area, for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the development of technologies in the area of medical and industrial radioisotopes. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, substantially all of these costs related to our mPower program for the development of our BWXT mPower™ reactor and the associated power plant. Contractual arrangements for customer-sponsored research and development can vary on a case-by-case basis and include contracts, cooperative agreements and grants.
Research and development activities totaled $50.4 million, $40.1 million and $38.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These activities include amounts paid for by our customers of $43.2 million, $33.7 million and $27.7 million, in the years ended December 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Hazard Risks and Insurance
Our operations present risks of injury to or death of people, loss of or damage to property and damage to the environment. We have created loss control systems to assist us in the identification and treatment of the hazard risks presented by our operations, and we endeavor to make sure these systems are effective.
As loss control measures will not always be successful, we seek to establish various means of funding losses and liability related to incidents or occurrences. We primarily seek to do this through contractual protections, including waivers of consequential damages, indemnities, caps on liability, liquidated damages provisions and access to the insurance of other parties. We also procure insurance, operate our own captive insurance company and/or establish funded or unfunded reserves. However, none of these methods will eliminate all risks.

Depending on competitive conditions, the nature of the work, industry custom and other factors, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate contractual protection from our customers and other parties against losses and liabilities arising out of or related to the performance of our work. The scope of the protection may be limited, may be subject to conditions and may not be supported by adequate insurance or other means of financing. In addition, we sometimes have difficulty enforcing our contractual rights with others following a material loss.
Similarly, insurance for certain potential losses or liabilities may not be available or may only be available at a cost or on terms we consider not to be economical. Insurers frequently react to market losses by ceasing to write or severely limiting coverage for certain exposures. Risks that we have frequently found difficult to cost-effectively insure against include, but are not limited to, property losses from wind, flood and earthquake events, nuclear hazards and war, pollution liability, liabilities related to occupational health exposures (including asbestos), liability related to our executives, professional liability/errors and omissions coverage, the failure, misuse or unavailability of our information technology systems, the failure of security measures designed to protect our information technology systems from security breaches and liability related to risk of loss of our work in progress. In cases where we place insurance, we are subject to the credit worthiness of the relevant insurer(s), the available limits of the coverage, our retention under the relevant policy, exclusions in the policy and gaps in coverage.
Our operations in designing, engineering, manufacturing, constructing and servicing nuclear power equipment and components for our commercial nuclear utility customers subject us to various risks, including, without limitation, damage to our customers' property and third-party claims for personal injury, environmental liability, death and property damage. To protect against liability for damage to a customer's property, we endeavor to obtain waivers of liability and subrogation from the customer and its insurer. We also attempt to cap our overall liability in our contracts. To protect against liability from claims brought by third parties, we seek to be insured under the utility customer's nuclear liability policies and have the benefit of the indemnity and limitation of any applicable liability provision of the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability of U.S. manufacturers and operators of licensed nuclear facilities and other parties who may be liable in respect of, and indemnifies them against, all claims in excess of a certain amount. This amount is determined by the sum of commercially available liability insurance plus certain retrospective premium assessments payable by operators of commercial nuclear reactors. For those sites where we provide environmental remediation services, we seek the same protection from our customers as we do for our other nuclear activities. The Price-Anderson Act, as amended, includes a sunset provision and requires renewal each time that it expires. Contracts that were entered into during a period of time that the Price-Anderson Act was in full force and effect continue to receive the benefit of the Price-Anderson Act's nuclear indemnity. The Price-Anderson Act is set to expire on December 31, 2025. We also provide nuclear fabrication and other services to the nuclear power industry in Canada. Canada's Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act generally conforms to international conventions and is conceptually similar to the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S. Accordingly, indemnification protections and the possibility of exclusions under Canada's Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act are similar to those under the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S.
We supply commercial nuclear equipment and services to certain customers in countries other than the U.S. and Canada that are party to international treaties and in countries that are not signatory to international treaties but have their own nuclear liability laws that, in general, have regulations in place whereby nuclear operators are solely liable for nuclear damage claims, which would exclude nuclear suppliers from any such exposure. BWXT does retain some level of risk in the event of future changes to the legal landscape in these countries regarding international third-party nuclear liability.
In 2008, the U.S. ratified the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage ("CSC") with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The CSC is an international treaty developed to create a global legal framework for allocating responsibility and assuring prompt and equitable compensation in the unlikely event of certain nuclear incidents. The ratification by the U.S. authorizes the Secretary of Energy to issue regulations establishing a retrospective risk pooling program whereby, in the event that the U.S. must make a contribution to the CSC international fund, U.S. nuclear suppliers, including BWXT, would pay the full cost of this contribution by the U.S.
Although we do not own or operate any nuclear reactors, we have some coverage under commercially available nuclear liability and property insurance for our facilities that are currently licensed to possess special nuclear materials. Substantially all of our Nuclear Operations Group segment contracts involving nuclear materials are covered by and subject to the nuclear indemnity provisions of either the Price-Anderson Act or Public Law 85-804, which, among other things, authorizes the DOE to indemnify certain contractors when such acts would facilitate national defense. However, to the extent the value of the nuclear materials in our care, custody or control exceeds the commercially available limits of our insurance, we potentially have underinsured risk of loss for such nuclear material.
Our Nuclear Services Group segment participates in the management and operation of various U.S. Government facilities. This participation is customarily accomplished through the participation in joint ventures with other contractors for 
10

any given facility. These activities involve, among other things, handling nuclear devices and their components. Insurable liabilities arising from these sites are rarely protected by our or our partners' corporate insurance programs. Instead, we rely on government contractual agreements and insurance purchased specifically for a site. The U.S. Government has historically fulfilled its contractual agreement to reimburse its contractors for covered claims, and we expect it to continue this process during our participation in the administration of these facilities. However, in most of these situations in which the U.S. Government is contractually obligated to pay, the payment obligation is subject to the availability of authorized government funds. The reimbursement obligation of the U.S. Government is also conditional, and provisions of the relevant contract or applicable law may preclude reimbursement.
Our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary provides primary workers' compensation, employer's liability, commercial general liability and automotive liability insurance to support our operations. We may also have business reasons in the future to have our insurance subsidiary accept other risks that we cannot or do not wish to transfer to outside insurance companies. These risks may be considerable in any given year or cumulatively. Our insurance subsidiary has not provided significant amounts of insurance to unrelated parties. Claims as a result of our operations could adversely impact the ability of our insurance subsidiary to respond to all claims presented.
Additionally, upon the February 22, 2006 effectiveness of the settlement relating to the Chapter 11 proceedings involving several of our subsidiaries, most of our subsidiaries contributed substantial insurance rights to the asbestos personal injury trust, including rights to (1) certain pre-1979 primary and excess insurance coverages and (2) certain of our 1979-1986 excess insurance coverage. These insurance rights provided coverage for, among other things, asbestos and other personal injury claims, subject to the terms and conditions of the policies. The contribution of these insurance rights was made in exchange for the agreement on the part of the representatives of the asbestos claimants, including the representative of future claimants, to the entry of a permanent injunction, pursuant to Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, to channel to the asbestos trust all asbestos-related general liability claims against our subsidiaries and former subsidiaries arising out of, resulting from or attributable to their operations, and the implementation of related releases and indemnification provisions protecting those subsidiaries and their affiliates from future liability for such claims. Although we are not aware of any significant, unresolved claims against our subsidiaries and former subsidiaries that are not subject to the channeling injunction and that relate to the periods during which such excess insurance coverage related, with the contribution of these insurance rights to the asbestos personal injury trust, it is possible that we could have underinsured or uninsured exposure for non-derivative asbestos claims or other personal injury or other claims that would have been insured under these coverages had the insurance rights not been contributed to the asbestos personal injury trust. In conjunction with the spin-off, claims and liabilities associated with these asbestos personal injury, property damage and indirect property damage claims have been expressly assumed by BWE pursuant to the master separation agreement between us and BWE.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
General
Many aspects of our operations and properties are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to:

• | possessing and processing special nuclear materials;


• | workplace health and safety;


• | constructing and equipping electric power facilities;


• | currency conversions and repatriation;


• | taxation of earnings; and


• | protecting the environment.

We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors.
We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
11

Environmental
Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for non-compliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
These laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to these federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and waste and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, including the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
We are currently in the process of investigating and remediating some of our current and former operating sites. Although we have recorded reserves in connection with certain of these environmental matters, due to the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation, there can be no assurance that the actual costs resulting from these remediation matters will not exceed the recorded reserves.
Our compliance with U.S. federal, state and local environmental control and protection regulations resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $14.1 million, $14.2 million and $14.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, compliance with existing environmental regulations necessitated capital expenditures of $0.9 million, $1.3 million and $0.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to spend another $3.4 million on such capital expenditures over the next five years. We cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future, but we anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and costly. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial condition as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under CERCLA. CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
Environmental remediation projects have been and continue to be undertaken at certain of our current and former plant sites. In 2002, Congress directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Army Corps") to clean up radioactive waste at the Shallow Land Disposal Area located in Parks Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania (the "SLDA"), consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding between the NRC and the Army Corps for Coordination on Cleanup and Decommissioning of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program Sites with NRC-Licensed Facilities, dated July 5, 2001 (the "MOU"). From 1961 to 1970, the SLDA was operated by the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation ("NUMEC") pursuant to Atomic Energy Commission ("AEC") License SNM-145. The AEC was the predecessor to the NRC. The SLDA was used for the disposal of waste from NUMEC's nuclear fuels fabrication facility in Apollo, Pennsylvania. Both radioactive and non-radioactive waste was disposed in a series of trenches at the SLDA. NUMEC, a former subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Company ("ARCO") was acquired by BWXT in November 1971. Shortly after the Army Corps' contractor commenced cleanup operations in 2011, the Army Corps ceased excavation activities because the contractor deviated from accepted field procedures, and the excavated material was found to be complex and beyond the Army Corps' characterization and 
12

management procedures. The MOU was modified in late 2014 to add the DOE and the NNSA as parties to deal with "special nuclear materials." In December 2014, the Army Corps issued a Proposed Record of Decision Amendment, which reflects a revised cost estimate of $350 million, in addition to the $62 million expended through September 2014, to implement the selected remedy. According to the Army Corps, it expects to award a new remediation contract in late 2018 and re-commence cleanup operations pending completion of work plans by the new contractor, subject to funding. The federal legislation directing the Army Corps to clean up the SLDA also directs the Army Corps to seek to recover response costs from appropriate responsible parties in accordance with CERCLA. In connection with BWXT's acquisition of NUMEC from ARCO in November 1971, ARCO assumed and agreed to indemnify and hold harmless BWXT with respect to claims and liabilities arising as a result of transactions or operations of NUMEC prior to the acquisition date. Although this ARCO indemnity would cover claims by the Army Corps to seek recovery from BWXT, no assurance can be given that such indemnity will be available or sufficient in the event liability claims are asserted for SLDA cleanup costs against BWXT. For a description of current legal proceedings related to the SLDA, see "Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
We perform significant amounts of work for the U.S. Government under both prime contracts and subcontracts and operate certain facilities that are licensed to possess and process special nuclear materials. As a result of these activities, we are subject to continuing reviews by governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and the NRC.
The NRC's decommissioning regulations require our Nuclear Operations Group segment to provide financial assurance that it will be able to pay the expected cost of decommissioning its licensed facilities at the end of their service lives. We provided financial assurance totaling $56.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 with surety bonds and letters of credit for the ultimate decommissioning of these licensed facilities. These two facilities have provisions in their government contracts pursuant to which substantially all of our decommissioning costs and financial assurance obligations are covered by the DOE, including the costs to complete the decommissioning projects underway at the facility in Erwin, Tennessee. These surety bonds and letters of credit are to cover decommissioning required pursuant to work not subject to this DOE obligation.
In Canada, the CNSC's decommissioning regulations require our Nuclear Power Group segment to provide financial assurance that it will be able to pay the expected cost of decommissioning its two CNSC-licensed facilities at the end of their service lives. We provided financial assurance totaling $41.7 million and $39.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with letters of credit for the ultimate decommissioning of these licensed facilities.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had total environmental accruals, including provisions for the facilities discussed above, of $93.3 million and $86.3 million, respectively. Of our total environmental accruals at December 31, 2017 and 2016, $13.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, were included in current liabilities. Inherent in the estimates of those accruals and recoveries are our expectations regarding the levels of contamination, decommissioning costs and recoverability from other parties, which may vary significantly as decommissioning activities progress. Accordingly, changes in estimates could result in material adjustments to our operating results, and the ultimate loss may differ materially from the amounts we have provided for in our consolidated financial statements.
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the "safe harbor" protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our Company. Statements and assumptions regarding expectations and projections of specific projects, our future backlog, revenues, income and capital spending, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures, return of capital activities or margin improvement initiatives are examples of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "goal," "could," "intend," "may," "should" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.
In addition, various statements in this Report, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements appear in Item 1 – "Business" and Item 3 – "Legal Proceedings" in Part I of this Report, in Item 7 – "Management's Discussion and 
13

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report and elsewhere in this Report.
We have based our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us and our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industries and our Company. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not rely unduly on them as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. While our management considers these statements and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous factors, including potentially the risk factors described in the section labeled Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Report, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements.
We have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this Report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this Report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update or review any forward-looking statement or our description of important factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that factors not referred to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
