ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------


Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Montauk,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Montauk Renewables, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Business Overview 
 We are a renewable energy company specializing in the recovery and processing of biogas from landfills and other non-fossil fuel sources for beneficial use as a replacement to fossil fuels. We develop, own, and operate RNG projects, using proven technologies that supply renewable fuel into the transportation and electrical power sectors. We are one of the largest U.S. producers of RNG, having participated in the industry for over 30 years. We established our operating portfolio of 12 RNG and three Renewable Electricity projects through self-development, partnerships, and acquisitions that span six states and have grown our revenues from $33.8 million in 2014 to $148.1 million in 2021. 
 Biogas is produced by microbes as they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen (during a process called anaerobic digestion). Our two current sources of commercial scale biogas are LFG or ADG. We typically secure our biogas feedstock through long-term fuel supply agreements and property lease agreements with biogas site hosts. Once we secure long-term fuel supply rights, we design, build, own, and operate facilities that convert the biogas into RNG or use the processed biogas to produce Renewable Electricity. We sell the RNG and Renewable Electricity through a variety of term length agreements. Because we are capturing waste methane and making use of a renewable source of energy, our RNG and Renewable Electricity generate valuable Environmental Attributes which we can monetize under federal and state renewable initiatives. 
 Demand for RNG produced from biogas remains strong due to increasing public policy initiatives focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, as well as continued public and private sector interest in the development of additional renewable energy sources to offset traditional fossil fuels. The Biden Administration has noted the importance of regulating the emission of methane as a key part of mitigating climate change, including through, among other actions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s November 15, 2021 proposed regulation of methane emissions associated with oil and gas operations. We believe the renewed regulatory focus on controlling methane emissions as part of a wider greenhouse gas reduction strategy, relatively untapped domestic agricultural waste feedstock and continued strong public and private support for renewable energy development supports the continued expansion of RNG production from landfill and agriculturally derived sources of biogas in the U.S. 
 Montauk continuously evaluates sources of waste methane in the United States that could serve as potential future commercial-scale project opportunities. We also continue our growth through optimization of our existing assets and project portfolio, securing greenfield developments and acquiring existing projects. We also include in our growth other vertical integration opportunities adjacent to our core operations. Additionally, we are actively exploring third-party service offerings to further monetize Montauk’s deep experience in operating LFG and ADG projects. Our successful evaluation and execution of project opportunities is based on our ability to leverage our significant industry experience, relationships with customers and vendors, access to interconnections for rights-of-way, and capabilities to construct pipeline and electrical interconnections that ensure the economic viability of opportunities we pursue. We exercise financial discipline in pursuing these projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects and associated feedstock costs, offtake contracts and any other related attributes that can be monetized. 
 Our current operating projects produce either RNG or Renewable Electricity by processing biogas from landfill sites or agricultural waste from livestock farms. We view agricultural waste from livestock farms as a significant opportunity for us to expand our RNG business, while we continue to evaluate other agricultural feedstock opportunities. We believe that our business model and technology are highly scalable given availability of biogas from agriculturally derived sources, which will allow us to continue to grow through prudent development and complimentary acquisitions.

  Our projects provide our landfill and agriculture partners with a variety of benefits, including a means to monetize biogas from their sites, support their regulatory compliance, and provide them with value-added environmental services. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on our long history of working with leading vendors and technologies and through our extensive expertise in designing, tuning and managing gas control collection systems at our host sites. We have significant experience with commercialized beneficial uses of processed biogas, including pipeline-quality RNG, power generation, carbon capture and boiler fuel gas products. 
 Our revenues are generated from the sale of RNG and Renewable Electricity under termed agreements, along with the Environmental Attributes that are derived from these products. RNG has the same chemical composition as natural gas from fossil sources, but has unique Environmental Attributes assigned to it through government incentive programs due to its origin from low-carbon, renewable sources, which we can also monetize. Virtually all of the RNG we produce is used as a transportation fuel because this market generally provides the most value for our RNG production. The RNG we process is pipeline-quality and can be used for transportation fuel when converted to CNG or LNG. CNG has been the most common fuel used by fleets where medium-duty trucks are close to the fueling station, such as city fleets, local delivery trucks and waste haulers. 
 When used as a transportation fuel or to produce electricity, RNG can generate additional revenue streams through the generation and sale of Environmental Attributes under various programs, including the national renewable fuels standard and state-level California LCFS. The Environmental Attributes that we generate and sell are composed of RINs and LCFS credits, which are generated from the conversion of biogas to RNG that is used as a transportation fuel, as well as RECs generated from the conversion of biogas to Renewable Electricity. In addition to revenues generated from our product sales, we also generate revenues by providing various value-added services to certain of our biogas site partners. In 2021 and 2020, our projects generated approximately 11.0% and 13.5%, respectively, of all D3 RINs in the United States. During 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our production as a renewable component of refinery fuel exports into the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive from certain RNG production facilities that have achieved International Sustainability & Carbon Certification registration. This diversification strategy accounted for approximately 0.7% of the reduction in generation of D3 RINs. 
 Whenever possible, we seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity and Environmental Attribute pricing volatility. Through contractual arrangements with our site hosts and counterparties, we typically share pricing and production risks while retaining our ability to benefit from potential upside. A portion of the RNG volume we produce is sold under bundled fixed-price arrangements for the RNG and Environmental Attributes, some of which include a sharing arrangement where we benefit from prices above certain thresholds. For our remaining RNG projects, we may enter into in-kind sharing arrangements where our partners receive the Environmental Attributes instead of a cash payment, thereby sharing in Environmental Attribute pricing risk. 
 On the electricity side of our business, all of our products and related Environmental Attributes are sold under fixed-price contracts with escalators, limiting our pricing risk. Finally, our contracts with site hosts often require payments to our site hosts in the form of royalties based on realized revenues, direct development contributions, or, in some select cases, based on production volumes. 
 Products Sold
The revenues Montauk receives from selling renewable energy consist of two main components. The first component is revenues from the commodity value of the natural gas or electricity generated. The second component is from the Environmental Attributes derived from the production of RNG and Renewable Electricity. For RNG, Environmental Attribute revenues are substantially generated from RINs when used as a transportation fuel. In addition, RNG can generate an additional revenue stream when used as a transportation fuel in states that have adopted low-carbon fuel incentive programs. The primary Environmental Attributes derived from the production of electricity from renewable resources are RECs, which translate into additional revenues for units of Renewable Electricity produced.

  RNG. LFG and gas from livestock digesters can be processed into pipeline-quality RNG by removing the majority of the non-methane components including carbon dioxide, water, sulfur, nitrogen, and other trace compounds. RNG can be used for transportation fuel when compressed (CNG) or liquefied (LNG) and virtually all of the RNG we produce is used in this manner. 
 RNG, like traditional natural gas, is traded nationally. Once in an interstate pipeline, RNG can be transported to vehicle fueling stations to be used as a transportation fuel, to utilities to generate power, or for use in generating fuel cell energy anywhere within the North American pipeline system. This flexibility enables us to capture value from the renewable attributes of biogas by delivering RNG to markets and customers that place a premium on renewable energy. 
 RNG is priced in-line with the wholesale natural gas market, based on Henry Hub pricing, with regional variation according to demand. We sell the RNG produced from our projects under a variety of short-term and medium-term agreements to counterparties, with tenures varying from three years to five years. Our contracts with counterparties are typically structured to be based on varying natural gas price indices for the RNG produced. We also share a portion of our Environmental Attributes with certain pathway providers as consideration for the counterparty using our RNG as a transportation fuel. 
 D3 RINs. RNG has the same chemical composition as natural gas from fossil sources, but has unique Environmental Attributes assigned to it due to its origin from organic sources. These attributes qualify RNG as a renewable fuel under the federal RFS program, established pursuant to the EPACT 2005 and EISA, allowing RNG to generate renewable fuel credits called RINs when the RNG is used as a transportation fuel. 
 RINs are saleable regulatory credits that represent a quantity of qualifying fuel and are used by refiners and importers to evidence compliance with their RFS obligations. Given that the RFS is a national program, the price of a RIN is the same anywhere in the United States. The RFS program originally contemplated 1.75 billion gallons of fuel from cellulosic biofuels by 2014, the use of which would be tracked through D3 RINs. However, cellulosic biofuel production grew slower than expected and prompted the EPA to expand the definition of biofuels that could qualify for D3 RINs to include fuels from cellulosic biogas, including biogas from landfills, livestock farms, and WRRFs. This significantly increased the quantity of D3 RINs produced, with production increasing to approximately 33 million net RINs in 2014 and 505 million net RINs in 2021. In addition, given the historic shortage in supply of D3 RINs to meet blending requirements, the EPA allows obligated refiners to satisfy RFS compliance obligations for D3 RINs by either purchasing CWC plus D5 RINs or by purchasing D3 RINs. CWC prices are set annually and are typically published by the EPA each November, with an estimated CWC price for 2022 of approximately $2.23 based on calculation methodology. The value of a D3 RIN is therefore a derivative of the market price for D5 RINs and CWCs, which in turn, are inversely linked to the wholesale price of gasoline. 
 We have been active in the RFS program since 2014 and expect to remain a significant contributor to the overall generation of RINs from RNG. We monetize our portion of the RINs, directly, at auction or through third-party agents or marketers. 
 CA LCFS. CA LCFS credits are environmental credits generated in California in order to stimulate the use of cleaner, low-carbon fuels. This program encourages the production of low-carbon fuels by setting annual CI standards, which are intended to reduce GHG emissions from the state’s transportation sector. One of the key aspects of the program is that it encourages the use of low-carbon transportation fuel, such as CNG, in vehicles instead of gasoline. This program further encourages use of renewable fuels in vehicles over CNG from fossil fuels. 
 The value of an CA LCFS credit varies according to the CI value of the fuel source as determined by CARB. Fuels that have a lower CI score benefit from a higher percentage of a CA LCFS credit. RNG from LFG 
 
3 

  and livestock digester biogas that are used as a transportation fuel both qualify for CA LCFS credits. The number of CA LCFS credits for RNG from livestock digesters is significantly higher than the number of CA LCFS credits for RNG from landfills, due to the relative CI scores of the two fuels. Fuel that is eligible for RINs can also receive CA LCFS credits. As a result, CA LCFS credits represent a revenue stream incremental to the value RNG producers receive for RINs. For livestock digester RNG projects, CA LCFS credits are a substantial revenue driver. We have seven projects which are currently approved and eligible to earn CA LCFS credits, and we expect the revenue generated by CA LCFS credits to increase as we continue to develop and bring additional livestock digester projects online over the next few years. 
 Several states in the United States also have or are considering adopting this model. Oregon’s Clean Fuels Program, enacted in 2009 and implemented in 2016, which operates using a credit system similar to the CA LCFS program. Similar to RINs, LCFS credits can be sold separately from the RNG fuel sold, allowing us to monetize LCFS credits for fuel produced and purchased outside of states that have LCFS programs. 
 Renewable Electricity. Electricity is a commodity that trades and is priced on a regional basis in and among regional control areas. Pricing for commodity-sold electricity can be based on day-ahead prices for scheduled deliveries or hourly, real-time prices for unscheduled deliveries. Prices vary across the country based on weather, load patterns and local power and transmission restrictions. The Renewable Electricity produced at our biogas-to-electricity projects is sold under long-term contracts to credit-worthy counterparties, typically under a fixed price with escalators. The terms of these contracts range from 5 to 22 years, with a weighted average remaining tenure of 14 years, based on 2021 expected electricity production. 
 RECs. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource in all 37 states that encourage or mandate the use of renewable energy. Thirty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have RPS that require utilities to supply a percentage of power from renewable resources, and seven states have a Renewable Portfolio Goal that is similar to RPS, but it is an objective or goal and not a requirement. Many states allow utilities to comply with RPS through tradable RECs, which provide an additional revenue stream to RNG projects that produce electricity from biogas. 
 The value of a REC is dependent on each state’s renewable energy requirements as mandated by its RPS. REC values are higher in states which require a percentage of total electricity to come from renewable resources. In states with no renewable energy requirements, RECs can have no value at all. In some markets, we have entered into PPAs under which we sell RECs bundled with the power being sold at a combined price. This occurs where the utility off-take counterparty offers a combined rate for the renewable energy it needs to satisfy RPS or other business requirements that is the best combined price for one of our projects. 
 Reorganization Transactions
On January 4, 2021, the Company, Montauk Holdings Limited (“MNK”) and Montauk Holdings USA, LLC (a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of MNK at the time, “Montauk USA”) entered into a series of transactions, including an equity exchange (the “Equity Exchange”) and a distribution collectively referred to as the “Reorganization Transactions,” that resulted in the Company owning all of the assets and entities (other than Montauk USA) previously owned by Montauk USA, and Montauk Renewables became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of MNK. Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, MNK’s business and operations were conducted entirely through Montauk USA and its U.S. subsidiaries, and MNK held no substantial assets other than equity of Montauk USA. The Company had no significant operations or assets prior to January 4, 2021 when it engaged in the equity exchange with Montauk USA and MNK. 
 After completion of the Reorganization Transactions, (i) Montauk USA ceased to own any substantial assets and (ii) all entities through which MNK’s business and operations were conducted became owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. MNK adopted a plan contemporaneously with the completion of the Reorganization Transactions that authorized the future liquidation and dissolution of MNK.

  On January 15, 2021, MNK sold the membership interest of Montauk USA to a third party. On January 26, 2021, MNK distributed all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as a pro rata dividend to the holders of MNK’s ordinary shares (the “Distribution”), subject to any tax withholding obligations under applicable South African law. Each ordinary share of MNK outstanding on January 21, 2021, the record date for the Distribution, entitled the holder thereof to receive one share of the Company’s common stock. 
 On January 26, 2021, the Company closed the initial public offering of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “IPO”) with the shares traded under the symbol “MNTK.” Montauk Renewables issued 2,702,500 shares at $8.50 per share and received gross proceeds of $22,971. The Company’s common stock was also secondarily listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “MKR.” 
 On January 26, 2021, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note (the “Initial Promissory Note”) with MNK. MNK is currently an affiliate of the Company and certain of the Company’s directors and executive officers are also directors and executive officers of MNK. Pursuant to the Initial Promissory Note, the Company advanced a cash loan of $5,000 to MNK for MNK to pay its dividends tax liability arising from the Reorganization Transactions under the South African Income Tax Act, 1962 (Act No. 58 of 1962), as amended (the “South African Income Tax Act”). On February 22, 2021, the Company and MNK entered into an Amended and Restated Promissory Note (the “Amended Promissory Note”) to increase the principal amount of the loan to a total of $7,140, in the aggregate, and on December 22, 2021 entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note (the “Second Amended Promissory Note”) to increase the principal amount of the loan to a total of $8,940, in the aggregate, each in accordance with the Company’s obligations set forth in the Transaction Implementation Agreement entered into by and among the Company, MNK and the other party thereto, dated November 6, 2020, and amended on January 14, 2021. 
 MNK was delisted from the JSE on January 26, 2021. MNK is expected to be liquidated within 24 months of the Distribution. 
 Strategy Overview 
 We further refined our business strategy in fiscal 2021 to focus on the following three areas that present the greatest growth opportunities for the Company at this time. A detailed discussion of each strategy pillar is included in the narrative below. 
Continued Expansion into Agricultural Feedstocks for RNG Production 
 

• | In May 2021, Montauk acquired a privately-held entity in North Carolina through a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Montauk Ag Renewables, LLC (“Montauk Ag”), and its associated technologies and assets (the “Asset Acquisition”). We subsequently secured U.S. patent protection on certain related technology.

Continued Expansion into Agricultural Feedstocks for RNG Production 
 As part of our long-term strategy, we are focused on diversifying our project portfolio beyond LFG through expansion into additional methane producing assets, while opportunistically adding third-party developed technology capabilities to boost financial performance and our overall cost competitiveness. We are commercially operating our first agricultural waste project (dairy manure), actively pursuing new fuel supply opportunities in WRRFs, and looking at long-term organic waste and sludge opportunities for the generation of biogas. 
 We view dairy farms and other forms of organic agricultural waste as a significant opportunity for us to expand our RNG business, as processing biogas from dairy farms and from other forms of organic agricultural waste requires similar expertise and capabilities as processing biogas from landfills. Many of the existing biogas processing in these industries is for electricity production, which creates additional opportunities for acquisition and conversion to higher-value RNG facilities. 
 We undertook an agricultural project when we closed on the acquisition of Pico, the anaerobic digester and two Jenbacher engines at the Bettencourt dairy farm in Jerome, Idaho in September 2018. The project sources manure from a dairy farm with up to approximately 18,500 milking cows. While Pico was initially a Renewable Electricity site, we brought an RNG facility at that location online in 2020. The facility sells transportation fuel into the California transportation market. The collection of the fuel supply is much easier at dairy farms than at landfills due to higher quality, more uniform feedstock, less volatility in inlet gas and biogas collection in a more controlled environment. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed an amendment to our Pico feedstock agreement (“Pico Feedstock Amendment”). The amendment will increase the amount of feedstock supplied to the facility for processing over a one to three-year period. 
 During the third quarter of 2021, and as part of our overall capacity expansion at the Pico facility, we undertook significant efforts to improve the performance of the existing digestion process at our Pico facility. We temporarily idled RNG production at this facility in order to clean out settled solids in the digester, replace the cover of the digester, and make various other efficiency improvements. We have subsequently resumed operations during the first quarter of 2022. The improvement project has impacted the timeline for modeling Pico’s initial CI Score pathway model and subsequent auditing approval by CARB. We did not receive a temporary CI pathway in 2021 and were not able to generate LCFS credit revenue on 2021 production. We will be storing 2022 production while CARB completes its CI Score Pathway. We expect to receive the results of this approval during the second half of 2022. However, we do not currently expect to receive LCFS credit revenue on 2022 production until 2023. 
 During the second quarter of 2021, we, through a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Montauk Ag Renewables, LLC (“Montauk Ag”), completed a series of transactions with Joseph P. Carroll, Jr. (“Carroll”), Martin A. Redeker (“Redeker”) and certain of their affiliates to purchase identified assets related to developing technology to recover residual natural resources from waste streams of modern agriculture and to refine and recycle such waste products through proprietary and other processes in order to produce high quality renewable natural gas, bio-oil and biochar (the “Montauk Ag Renewables Acquisition”). The assets acquired include real property, intellectual property, mobile equipment, and other equipment related to operating the business. The real property includes the purchase of an approximate 9.35-acre parcel in Duplin County, North Carolina. Additionally, Messrs. Carroll and Redeker joined Montauk as full-time employees, focused on refining and scaling the technology and capabilities to develop new agricultural waste stream projects. 
 Other industries that present opportunities of scale for biogas conversion include swine farms and WRRFs. Like dairy farms, biogas production from swine farms is a nascent biogas industry, with less than 1% of swine 
 
-6- 

  farms with biogas processing capabilities. Additionally, roughly 23% of WRRFs have biogas processing facilities, however, most process biogas for electricity production creating additional opportunities for acquisition and conversion to RNG facilities. As with LFG and dairy farms, biogas from both swine farms and WRRFs qualify for D3 RINs under the RFS program. We believe our demonstrated versatility to operate processing facilities using multiple fuel supply sources will give us a competitive advantage in these markets relative to other new entrants who have only demonstrated capabilities with one fuel supply source. Our Montauk Ag venture is currently evaluating a 5-year, approximately 20-unit development cluster project that will seek to optimize revenue streams from swine waste lagoon close-outs, and in particular, lagoon waste that cannot otherwise be processed through conventional digestion technology. 
 The drive toward voluntary and most likely regulatory-required organic waste diversion from landfills is of particular interest as we leverage our current experience base, and we believe this trend will provide long-term growth opportunities and that the market has not yet unlocked the full potential of RNG and Renewable Electricity. In August of 2021, Montauk Ag Renewables was granted a patent on technology to convert agricultural waste into multiple non-fossil renewable fuel alternatives. We believe this technology will provide a competitive advantage that will enable us to utilize a broader range of organic waste materials from the agricultural and WRFF sectors for the production of biogas and associated new RNG and/or Renewable Electricity projects. As our biogas processing technology continues to improve and the required energy intensity of the RNG and Renewable Electricity production process is reduced, we expect that we will be able to enter new markets for our products. 
 Optimize Existing Assets and Project Portfolio and Opportunistically Develop New Projects 
 Expanding Operations at Existing Project Sites. We monitor biogas supply availability across our portfolio and seek to maximize production at existing projects by expanding operations when economically feasible. Most of our landfill locations continue to accept waste deliveries and the available LFG at these sites is expected to increase over time, which we expect to support expanded production. In 2021, this has allowed us to maintain average production availability of approximately 87% at our RNG projects and 61% at our Renewable Electricity projects. The 2021 average production availability of our Renewable Electricity projects was lower compared to 2020 due to the delayed restoration of production at our Security facility. 
 We treat our existing assets as an integrated portfolio rather than a collection of individual projects. This allows us to utilize any new business practices or technologies across our entire project portfolio quickly, including advances with respect to troubleshooting, optimization, cost savings, and host site interaction. Our integrated, pro-active and value-add approach helps us maintain strong relationships with our partners, which we seek to leverage to optimize the performance of our existing projects. 
 We also experience organic growth in production at our existing projects as a result of increases in biogas supply at our projects and on-going optimization initiatives. We size our projects to account for this increase in the biogas supply curve over time. For example, at many of our newer projects, such as Apex and Galveston, we expect gradual increases in production as those landfill sites continue to grow. Additionally, many of our capacity expansion efforts to date, such as those at McCarty and Rumpke, have helped to optimize our project capacity to take advantage of excess biogas at older landfills that are still open and growing. Not only have our projects achieved an initial increase in production following the capacity expansion project, but we also expect to see continued gradual increases in production over time. 
 Converting Existing Renewable Electricity Projects to RNG. We periodically evaluate opportunities to convert existing projects from electricity generation to RNG production. These opportunities tend to be attractive for our merchant electricity projects given the favorable economics for RNG plus RIN sales relative to merchant electricity rates plus REC sales. To date, we have converted two projects from LFG-to-electricity to LFG-to-RNG and a third project from ADG-to-electricity to ADG-to-RNG. We will continue to explore the feasibility of other opportunities across our existing Renewable Electricity portfolio. 
 
-7- 

  Opportunistic Development of New Projects. We apply a financially disciplined model toward new project development that considers the relative risk of a given project and associated feedstock costs, offtake contracts and any other related Environmental Attributes that can be monetized. We are currently evaluating three project expansion opportunities at existing project sites. We regularly analyze potential new projects that are at various stages of negotiation, engineering design and financial review. The potential projects typically include a mix of new project sites and strategic acquisitions. Currently, no new potential projects are subject to definitive agreements and each potential opportunity is subject to competitive market conditions. 
The RNG industry remains highly fragmented. We believe continued industry fragmentation presents an opportunity for further industry consolidation. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this consolidation opportunity because of our scale, operational and managerial capabilities, and execution track record in integrating acquisitions. Over the last ten years, we have acquired 13 projects and members of our current management team have led all of those acquisitions. We expect that as we continue to scale up our business, our increased size, capabilities and access to capital will provide us with increased strategic acquisition opportunities. 
 Valued-added Service Offerings
Over our three decades of experience, we have developed the full range of RNG project related capabilities from engineering, construction, management and operations, through EHS oversight and Environmental Attributes management. By vertically integrating across RNG services, we are able to reduce development and operations costs, optimize efficiencies and improve operations. Our full suite of capabilities allows us to serve a multi-project partner for certain project hosts across multiple transactions, including through strategic transactions. To that end, we actively identify and evaluate opportunities to acquire entities that will further our vertically-integrated services.

  Our Current Operating Portfolio 
 We currently own and operate 15 projects, 12 of which are RNG projects and three of which are Renewable Electricity projects. Of our three Renewable Electricity projects we currently operate, we are considering options to convert one of them to produce RNG. In addition to the electricity-to-RNG conversion project, we are currently in the process of developing one additional RNG project from LFG. We are also working on other projects which will repurpose equipment from existing biogas facilities for use at new project sites. The below graphic does not include the Montauk Ag project, which is currently under development.

  Electricity production has been monetized under fuel supply agreements with expiration dates more than 15 years from December 31, 2021. Concurrent with our fuel supply agreements, we typically enter into property leases with our project hosts, which govern access rights, permitted activities, easements and other property rights. We own all equipment and facilities on each leased property, other than equipment provided by utility companies providing services on-site. Lease termination typically requires the restoration of the leased area to its original condition. We have successfully ended leases on four facilities and completed associated restoration activities, and are currently completing restoration of two other facilities. 
 Once collected, biogas can be processed into pipeline-quality RNG or converted into electricity. The conversion facility is typically located on landfill property away from the active fill operations where additional waste is added to the landfill site. 
 Our projects currently utilize three of the four proven commercial technologies available to process raw biogas into RNG, including: pressure swing absorption (“PSA”), Membrane Filtration and solvent scrubbing. We are capable of working with virtually all available biogas processing technologies at our sites. We attend industry conferences and maintain an ongoing dialogue with key equipment providers to ensure we stay informed of the latest technology that could be deployed at our current and future facilities. 
 Electricity is generated using gas-fueled engines or turbine-driven electrical generators, which are designed to operate efficiently on medium-Btu gas. As such, electricity generation typically involves producing medium-Btu gas, which is then pumped into a generating facility. The electricity is metered and sold under long-term contracts to utilities and municipalities or at spot prices. 
 Stated capacity reflects the design capacity of each facility. Several of our projects have reserve capacity when comparing design capacity to available biogas feedstock. Several previous acquisitions are gas limited and therefore do not operate at their design capacity. Our larger projects have expansions planned or are being evaluated for future expansions dependent on the availability of excess biogas feedstock. 
 RNG Projects 
 We currently own and operate 12 RNG projects in Ohio (two), Pennsylvania (five), Texas (four) and Idaho (one) which, in the aggregate, have a total design capacity of approximately 33,850 MMBtu/day.

A critical component of our business is our ability to negotiate and maintain long-term fuel supply agreements at our project sites. We have developed strong working relationships with our landfill site owners, including ten of 14 operating projects and other potential development projects each with Waste Management and Republic Services, the two largest waste companies in the United States, and actively seek to strategically extend our tenure at our project sites. 
 Our projects provide our landfill and agricultural partners a solution to monetize biogas from their sites, support their regulatory compliance and provide them with environmental services. We have had working relationships with Republic Services since 1986 and with Waste Management since 2004 and we enable monetization of their biogas while maintaining regulatory compliance. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our extensive experience across a variety of commercialized beneficial uses of processed biogas, including pipeline-quality natural gas, power generation and boiler fuel gas products. To date, we have not had any fuel supply agreement terminated by any site partner once we have established a facility on the site, which we believe serves as evidence of our operational expertise, reliability and consistent value delivered to our site partners. The table below is a summary of the expiration periods of those agreements. We are consistently reviewing and pursuing extensions for all of our fuel supply agreements well before their expirations and for future agreements, we continue to target contracts with expirations of 20 years from commencement of operation with options for extension.

Customers 
 Our customers for RNG and RINs typically include large, long-term owner-operators of landfills and livestock farms, local utilities, and large refiners in the natural gas and refining sectors. Royalty structures included in our agreements, as well as the large size of our counterparties, limit their credit risk. Victory Renewables, LLC and Valero each represented approximately 13.1% and 12.4%, respectively, of our operating revenues in 2021 from the sale of Environmental Attributes. We sell RINs to numerous RIN off-take parties and our largest RIN off-taker as a percentage of revenue can vary year to year given the short-term nature of these contracts. In addition to revenues from sales of RNG and RINs, we also share a portion of our Environmental Attributes with our pathway providers as in-kind consideration for the counterparty using our RNG as a transportation fuel. 
 Our customers for electricity typically include investor-owned and municipal electricity utilities. For the sale of Renewable Electricity and RECs, the City of Anaheim represented approximately 9.6% of our operating revenues in 2021. These sales occurred under a PPA between us and the City of Anaheim, in which electricity and RECs are sold at fixed prices. In 2021, we converted 100% of the monetization of our Renewable Electricity production and Environmental Attributes under fixed-price agreements. For our electricity sales, all of our customers with whom we have off-take agreements are investment-grade entities with low credit risk. 
 No other single customer represented more than 10% of our total 2021 operating revenues. 
 Suppliers and Equipment Vendors 
 The major technologies used by our projects for gas processing include solvent scrubbing PSA, and membrane separation. For electricity generation, we use reciprocating engines. This affords Montauk experience with substantially all major vendors in the sector, and technical expertise in numerous technologies. 
 We source equipment from a variety of major suppliers with specialties in each technology. We enter into written ordinary-course agreements with suppliers to obtain industry-standard equipment for use in our operations. The contracts generally do not include any intellectual property rights other than for the intended use of the equipment. Membrane separation equipment is primarily provided by UOP and Air Liquide. PSA equipment is primarily provided by Xebec, Guild, Air Products, and BioFerm. Solvent scrubbing is primarily provided by Selexol. RNG ancillary constituent removal is done using equipment provided by Iron Sponge, MV Technologies, Thiopaq, Guild Associates, and PSB Industries. Electricity generation equipment is provided by Solar Turbines, Caterpillar, and Jenbacher. 
 We have made substantial investments in a centralized Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system (Microsoft Dynamics) to better integrate operations across our projects. This system centralizes maintenance operations across all of our projects. Our proactive approach to maintenance, corrective maintenance, root cause analysis, failure reporting, project management, and budgeting are all completed using the ERP system.

  Competition 
 There are several other companies operating in the renewable energy and waste-to-energy space, ranging from other project developers to service or equipment providers. 
 Our primary competition is from other companies or solutions for access to biogas from waste. Evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics have a strong effect on the competitive landscape and our relative ability to continue to generate revenues and cash flows. We believe that our status as one of the largest operators of LFG-to-RNG projects, our 30-year track record of operating and developing projects, and our deep relationships with some of the largest landfill owners and dairy farms in the country position us very well to continue to operate and grow our portfolio, and respond to competitive pressures. We have demonstrated a track record of strategic flexibility across our 30-year history which has allowed us to pivot towards projects and markets that we believe deliver optimal returns and stockholder value in response to changes in market, regulatory and competitive pressures. 
 The biogas market is highly fragmented. We believe our size relative to many other LFG companies and our capital structure puts us in a strong position to compete for new project development opportunities or acquisitions of existing projects. However, competition for such opportunities, including the prices being offered for fuel supply, will impact the expected profitability of projects to us, and may make projects unsuitable to pursue. Likewise, prices being offered by our competitors for fuel supply may increase the royalty rates that we pay under our fuel supply agreements when such agreements expire and need to be renewed or when expansion opportunities present themselves at the landfills where our projects currently operate. It is also possible that more landfill owners may seek to install their own LFG projects on their sites, which would reduce the number of opportunities for us to develop new projects. Our overall size, reputation, access to capital, experience and decades of proven execution on LFG project development and operation leave us well-positioned to compete with other companies in our industry. 
 We are aware of several competitors in the United States that have a similar business model to our own, including Archaea Energy and Morrow Renewables, as well as companies with biogas-to-energy facilities as a segment or subsidiary of their operations, including DTE and Ameresco. In addition, certain landfill operators, such as Waste Management, have also chosen to selectively pursue biogas conversion projects at their sites. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our projects are subject to a range of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, depending on the nature and configuration of the project, as well as where the project is located. We have established processes and procedures to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations, and have partnered with external experts, as needed, to meet applicable compliance requirements. As a renewable energy company, we are committed to being good stewards of the environment and to positively impacting the communities in which we operate. 
 We are subject to the Clean Air Act which regulates the emissions of pollutants to protect the environmental and public health. The combustion of biogas results in emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Federal, state and local laws may require us to obtain permits or impose other burdens, including monitoring, testing recordkeeping and reporting by us in order for us to conduct operations. In addition, our operations and the operations of landfills may be subject to additional air emissions laws and regulations, such as those designed to address the emission of methane, a potent GHG. 
 Among other laws, we are subject to Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws, which impose conditions on the handling of non-hazardous waste, including the emission of methane in landfills. Likewise, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other federal, state and local laws, which govern the investigation 
 
-13- 

  and cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous substances. We have not been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to environmental remedial costs at any site to date. We also may be required to obtain permits to discharge wastewater and stormwater pursuant to the Clean Water Act’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and other federal, state and local laws governing such discharges. 
 Our RNG projects are subject to federal RFS program regulations, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act. The EPA administers the RFS program with volume requirements for several categories of renewable fuels. The EPA’s RFS regulations establish rules for fuel supplied and administer the RIN system for compliance, trading credits and rules for waivers. The EPA calculates a blending standard for each year based on estimates of gasoline usage from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency. Separate quotas and blending requirements are determined for cellulosic biofuels, BBD, advanced biofuels and total renewable fuel. Further, we are required to register each RNG project with the EPA and relevant state regulatory agencies. 
 We qualify our RINs through a voluntary Quality Assurance Plan, which typically takes from three to five months from first injection of RNG into the commercial pipeline system. Further, we typically make a large investment in the project prior to receiving the regulatory approval and RIN qualification. In addition to registering each RNG project, we are subject to quarterly audits under the Quality Assurance Plan of our projects to validate our qualification. 
 Our RNG projects are also subject to state renewable fuel standard regulations. The CA LCFS program requires producers of petroleum-based fuels to reduce the CI of their products, beginning with a quarter of a percent in 2011 a 10% total reduction in 2020, and a 20% total reduction in 2030. Petroleum importers, refiners and wholesalers can either develop their own low-carbon fuel products, or buy CA LCFS credits from other companies that develop and sell low-carbon alternative fuels, such as biofuels, electricity, natural gas or hydrogen. We are subject to a qualification process similar to that for RINs, including verification of CI levels and other requirements, currently exists for CA LCFS credits. 
 Our RNG projects are also impacted by state and federal gas quality standards. State regulators determine whether RNG may be purchased by the state’s local gas utilities, and whether a site operator may directly sell gas to a retail, or direct end-use, customer. FERC regulates the natural gas pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce, and specifies or approves a gas pipeline’s tariff that sets the rates, terms and conditions, gas quality, and other requirements applicable to transportation of natural gas on the pipelines, including shipping RNG. Our sites are not permitted, and may not be physically able, to deliver RNG to a FERC regulated pipeline unless the pipeline’s receipt of the gas is consistent with the standards adopted in the pipeline’s FERC tariff. RNG-related gas quality standards may vary by pipeline and may be revised at any time, subject to all required regulatory approvals. We routinely test the RNG produced at our facilities in order to ensure compliance with applicable pipeline gas quality standards. 
 We monitor regulatory trends and developments in the U.S. regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. We are aware the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the regulation of methane emissions, a greenhouse gas, from oil and gas facilities in November 2021. We do not anticipate this proposed regulation will apply to our operations and could, combined with another public policy and private sector initiatives, increase interest in developing more renewable energy projects in the U.S. We will continue to monitor greenhouse gas regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and assess their potential relevance to our business and operations. 
 We routinely conduct compliance audits on our projects to proactively identify and correct potential compliance deficiencies or risks. Additionally, we closely monitor emerging regulatory developments that may impact our operations or business strategy. Montauk also participates in industry trade groups, such as the RNG Coalition, to advocate policies and regulatory frameworks that support continued expansion of renewable energy in the United States.

  The operation of our business may expose us to certain liabilities and compliance costs related to environmental matters. These liabilities or compliance costs did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position for fiscal 2021, nor do we expect them to have a material effect in the future. We believe we are in material compliance with all environmental regulations applicable to our operations. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 Employee Profile 
 We employed 132 people on December 31, 2021, located in California, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Texas.
