ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated on March 1, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
On October 12, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (“Public Offering”) of 23,000,000 units, including the issuance of 3,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $230,000,000.
On March 11, 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) for a purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. On October 12, 2021, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,747,879 Founder Shares to the anchor investors for their purchase of the units in the Public Offering. The number of Founder Shares outstanding was determined based on the Company’s expectation that the total size of the Public Offering would be a maximum of 23,000,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full, and therefore that such Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Public Offering. Prior to our sponsor’s initial investment of $25,000, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Sponsor Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,150,000 warrants (the “Sponsor Private Placement Warrants”) to the sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,150,000, a portion of which was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Underwriters Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 1,000,000 warrants (the “Underwriters Private Placement Warrants,” and together with the Sponsor Private Placement Warrants, the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”) and Odeon Capital Group, LLC (“Odeon”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Underwriters Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $1,000,000, a portion of which was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by us, (ii) may not (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such Private Placement Warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by such holders until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. If the Company does not consummate its initial business combination within 18 months from the closing the Public Offering (by April 12, 2023) assuming there is no amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Underwriters Private Placement Warrants have been deemed compensation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and are therefore subject to the lock-up restrictions imposed by FINRA Rule 5110(e) pursuant to which these securities will not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the commencement of sales of the Public Offering except as permitted under FINRA 

4



Rule 5110(e)(2) including to any member who participated in the Public Offering and the officers or partners, registered persons or affiliates thereof. In addition, for as long as the Underwriters Private Placement Warrants are held by Cantor, Odeon, the other underwriters or their designees or affiliates, they may not be exercised after five years from the commencement of sales of the Public Offering. We have granted Cantor and Odeon or their designees or affiliates certain registration rights relating to these securities. The underwriters may not exercise their demand and “piggyback” registration rights after five and seven years, respectively, after the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Public Offering and may not exercise demand rights on more than one occasion.
Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, $231,150,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). We are not permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the Trust Account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our taxes and up to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses, as applicable, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (by April 12, 2023) assuming there is no amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (April 12, 2023) or (B) with respect to any material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $12,100,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $550,000 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, approximately $1,450,000 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was initially available to us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. As of December 31, 2021, there was approximately $231,151,505 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $611,620 of cash held outside the Trust Account.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector and in any region, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background so we can capitalize on their ability to identify, acquire and support the operations of a successful business. We therefore intend to focus on companies in the Technology, Media and Telecommunications (“TMT”) and Information and Communication Technology (“ICT”) industries, specifically the telecommunications infrastructure, internet and technology and digital services sectors operating in Europe and emerging markets (which may include a business based in the U.S., which has operations or opportunities in Europe and emerging markets or a business based in Europe and emerging markets which has operations or opportunities in the U.S.); however, we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that is not based in, and does not have any operations or opportunities in, Europe and emerging markets.
Business Strategy and Acquisition Criteria
We believe our sponsor’s and management team’s deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise, as well as their network of contacts, will uniquely position us to take advantage of proprietary opportunities in the telecommunications infrastructure, internet and technology and digital services sectors, where we believe opportunities exist to employ a “buy and build” (roll-up) strategy to consolidate assets across fragmented subsectors, creating new majors with improved efficiencies and network effects through scale. We believe this expertise and industry insight will allow us to generate a number of acquisition opportunities.

5



As a result of our investing and operating expertise, we believe there are a number of high-quality telecommunications infrastructure, internet and technology and digital services sector businesses in Europe and emerging markets with adequate scale to be attractive public companies in the United States, in particular operating within the following sectors of the TMT and ICT industries:
● Telecommunications and data-center infrastructure: The importance of the datacenter industry, fiber networks and cell tower companies has grown significantly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic due to an increase in demand for cloud-based services. Furthermore, the increased consumption of cloud-based services for remote work and school has accelerated the transition to online services, making access to broadband internet and high-bandwidth mobile data critical. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been significant growth in demand for mobile data, especially in Europe and emerging markets, with the improvement in 3rd generation (3G) and 4th generation (4G) connectivity standards, and the demand for mobile data is expected to increase further with the development of 5th generation (5G) connectivity standards. Meeting such demand will require numerous investments in the infrastructure of networks and datacenters to provide the needed online and cloud-based services.
● Internet and technology: We believe EU-based companies are well-positioned to navigate the stricter technology regulations of the EU. The EU is at the forefront of technology regulation, as demonstrated by the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. Even after years of battles between EU officials and global-tech giants like Apple, Facebook and Google, the EU continues to pursue tighter regulation in the form of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act to enhance competitiveness of the internet and technology industries in Europe. Considering that internet usage in Europe is on par with that of the U.S., we believe that EU-based companies are well-positioned to navigate the forthcoming changes in the regulatory regime, capture the increasing demand for data usage and become regional champions in the internet and technology space. Additionally, internet usage in emerging markets is increasing exponentially as existing technologies continue to commercialize in new geographies.
● Digital services: The digital services economy — especially fintech, medtech and digital media — represents a massive opportunity in Europe and emerging markets. We believe that many of the industries in the digital services space remain highly fragmented, especially in Europe and emerging markets, and that there may be opportunities to acquire one or more consumer focused businesses and pursue a “buy and build” consolidation strategy. Additionally, the proliferation of the “As-A-Service” business model (XaaS) has brought digital transformation to numerous new industries. Across multiple categories, XaaS companies serve as platforms, enabling innovation by supporting flexibility and agility to their customers, while remaining largely cost-effective. These traits of XaaS companies in particular, and digital services in general, are a recipe for strong and sustained growth, especially in emerging markets where non-digital alternatives are either absent or never fully matured. For example, fintech adoption is observed to be particularly strong in markets where physical bank branches and ATMs were never widely deployed, and thus, there was no incumbent alternative to compete with.

We believe the following factors represent a strong rationale for pursuing our business strategy:
● Broad universe of potential targets: We intend to focus our investment efforts across the TMT and ICT industries, including the telecommunications infrastructure, internet and technology and digital services sectors. We believe this broad universe of targets provides us with significant flexibility to identify opportunities with the greatest value creation potential. The sector comprises hundreds of different companies in various sub-vertical markets and distinct stages of life cycles. Given the rapid changes and emergence of novel business models in the TMT and ICT industries, we believe new companies will continue to be created, grow to meaningful sizes and become attractive acquisition targets, further supplementing the existing broad range of opportunities.
● Tailwinds from 5G rollout: The rising consumer demand for connectivity and a drastic increase in the number of global mobile connections has driven the evolution of the communication standard from 1st generation (1G) to the current 4G and will soon lead to a global ubiquity of 5G. We believe that this trend will drive significant growth and create value in telecommunications assets and digital infrastructure across countries.
● Favorable spending trends: Total global TMT and ICT expenditure has grown at a pace substantially above the rate of inflation in the recent past, and this growth is projected to continue over the years to come.
● Impacts of COVID-19: Government recognition of the critical importance of the TMT and ICT industries to meet the daily needs of citizens to access employment, education, telehealth, financial services and entertainment is at an all-time high. Governments are evaluating subsidies and updating regulatory treatment to ensure citizens have access to the internet.

● Rapid pace of innovation. Connectivity digital infrastructure, including disruptive new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, IoT and blockchain, are driving robust demand for access to increased and higher-quality TMT services and ICT infrastructure.

Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:
● are subject to low currency risks and earn a significant share of their revenues in a major global currency such as the U.S. dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), British pound (GBP) or Chinese yuan (CNY);
● have meaningful potential for future shareholder value creation through business growth and operational improvements;

● have achieved or have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of organic growth, synergistic add-on acquisitions, new product markets and geographies, increased production capacity, expense reduction and increased operating leverage;
● already have, or have the potential to generate, consistent, stable and recurring free cash flow with predictable and visible revenue streams;
● have a leading, growing or niche market position in their industries that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors.

These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
Sourcing and Evaluation of Business Combination Targets
We utilize the networks and industry experience of our management team and independent directors, as well as investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, family offices, lenders, attorneys, consultants, accounting firms, large business enterprises and other trusted advisors, to identify potential business combination targets. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. However, in no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by us prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.

7



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, management team or independent directors, or from completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or independent directors. If we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, management team or independent directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own Founder Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity and may only decide to present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity and consummating the same would not violate any restrictive covenants to which such officers and directors are subject. Our Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
Our founders and our directors and officers may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event that there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
Initial Business Combination
In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting discounts held in trust) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even 

8



if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to foregoing, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. If our securities are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the representative of the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares they hold and any public shares they may acquire during or after the Public Offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and the anchor investors will not be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares held by them, in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act.
Resources and Competition
Our Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that we will have only 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (until April 12, 2023) assuming there is no amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 18-month period (April 12, 2023), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of 

9



taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and requirements of other applicable law.
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other SPACs, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
We currently utilize office space at Arch 124, Salamanca Street, London SE1 7HX, United Kingdom from IX Acquisition Services LLC and the members of our management team. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have four officers: Guy Willner, Karen Bach, Noah Aptekar and Victoria Reid. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Available Information
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at Arch 124, Salamanca Street, London SE1 7HX, United Kingdom, or by telephone at +44 (0) (203) 983-0450.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

10



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th and (2) our annual revenues were equal to or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
