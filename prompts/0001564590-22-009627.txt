Company Overview
 Summary
 Geron is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor. Geron’s vision is to become a leader in the treatment of blood cancers, or hematologic malignancies, and is committed to improving and extending the lives of patients by changing the course of these diseases by targeting telomerase. We believe data from our prior Phase 2 clinical trials provide strong evidence that imetelstat targets telomerase to inhibit the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells enabling recovery of bone marrow and normal blood cell production, which indicate potential disease-modifying activity. We believe this potential disease modification may differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments in myeloid hematologic malignancies. 
 We are conducting two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials that are designed to enable registration of imetelstat: (i) IMerge Phase 3 in lower risk MDS, and (ii) IMpactMF in refractory MF. In the first half of 2022, we plan to start IMproveMF, a Phase 1 clinical trial of imetelstat in combination with ruxolitinib in frontline MF patients. In addition, in 2022, in collaboration with key opinion leaders with expertise in AML, we plan to support one or more investigator-led clinical trials in AML and higher risk MDS to evaluate imetelstat as a single agent and in combination with venetoclax or hypomethylating agents, or HMAs.
 For IMerge Phase 3, we expect top-line results to be available in early January 2023, based on current planning assumptions. Assuming the results of IMerge Phase 3 support regulatory submissions, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the U.S. in the first half of 2023, and a marketing authorization application, or MAA, in Europe in the second half of 2023, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS. Under either priority or standard review for the NDA and, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the U.S. could occur as early as the first half of 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, could take approximately 12 months and, if approved, that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur as early as the second half of 2024. 
 For IMpactMF, under current planning assumptions, we expect the trial to be fully enrolled in 2024. In addition, we expect the interim analysis for overall survival, or OS, for IMpactMF may occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. 
 Imetelstat has been granted Fast Track designations by the FDA for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to lower risk MDS, who do not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, also known as non-del(5q), and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA, and for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, or MF, who have relapsed after or are refractory to treatment with a janus associated kinase, or JAK, inhibitor, also known as relapsed/refractory MF. In October 2021, we gained access to the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway, or ILAP, in the United Kingdom, or U.K., through the receipt of an Innovation Passport for imetelstat to treat lower risk MDS. 
 Stage-Gated Milestone-Driven Commercial Plans for Imetelstat
 If imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat ourselves in the U.S. and may seek commercialization partners for territories outside of the U.S. Given these plans, we have developed a potential commercial launch plan that is driven by the achievement of certain clinical milestones, such as achieving top-line results in lower risk MDS in early January 2023. In 2022, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as enhancing and/or establishing company processes and systems to support a potential commercial launch if imetelstat is approved in lower risk MDS, refining market research in lower risk MDS and refractory MF and hiring commercial leadership in pricing, market analytics and marketing. In addition, we plan to evaluate our strategy for potential commercialization of imetelstat in Europe.
 Financial Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $212.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and current and noncurrent marketable securities. Under current planning assumptions, we believe our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations until the end of the first quarter of 2023. If top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are not available until after the end of the first quarter of 2023, we will require additional 
 6


capital to reach top-line results in IMerge Phase 3. In any event, we will require substantial additional funding to further advance the imetelstat program, including through completion of IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to potentially bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF.
Orphan Drug Designations and Market Exclusivity
 Imetelstat has been granted orphan drug designations for both the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, and MF in the U.S. and in Europe. In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, orphan drug designation would convey market exclusivity in the designated indication for seven years after drug product approval. Thus, if we were to receive drug product approval in the U.S. for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the first half of 2024, we anticipate that imetelstat will have orphan drug market exclusivity in the U.S. for such indication until the first half of 2031.
 In Europe, under the European Union Orphan drug regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, orphan drug designation would convey 12 years of market exclusivity, assuming we maintain orphan drug designation and fulfill the agreed upon pediatric investigation plan under the European Union Orphan drug regulation (EC) No. 141/2000. Thus, if we were to receive drug product approval in Europe for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the second half of 2024, we anticipate that imetelstat will have orphan drug market exclusivity in Europe for such indication until the second half of 2036.
 Patents and Patent Term Extensions
 We have issued U.S. and European patents that provide patent coverage into 2033 pertaining to the treatment of MF and MDS with imetelstat. We also hold issued patents covering imetelstat composition of matter. 
 In the U.S., our composition of matter patent coverage extends until December 2025, and our method of treatment patent rights for MDS and MF expire in March 2033. Under the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (as amended), or the Hatch-Waxman Act, upon receipt of drug product approval, potential patent term extensions, if any, may be available to extend the patent term of either our composition of matter patent, or our method of treatment patent for MDS, in the U.S. 
 In Europe, our composition of matter patent coverage expires in September 2024, and our method of treatment patent rights for MDS and MF expire in November 2033 in member countries of the European Patent Convention. One of our patents in each member country of the European Patent Convention may be eligible for patent term extension under a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, permitted under European Council (EC) Regulation No. 469/2009, or the European SPC Regulation, upon receipt of drug product approval, such as, for example, our method of treatment patent for MDS.

 Telomerase: Scientific Rationale
 Telomeres and Telomerase in Normal Development
 In the human body, normal growth and maintenance of tissues occurs by cell division. However, most cells are only able to divide a limited number of times, and this number of divisions is regulated by telomere length. Telomeres are repetitions of a deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, sequence located at the ends of chromosomes. They act as protective caps to maintain stability and integrity of the chromosomes, which contain the cell’s genetic material. Normally, every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, they shrink to a critically short length, and as a result, the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces.
 Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division, such as stem cells that must remain immortalized to support normal health. Telomerase consists of at least two essential components: a ribonucleic acid, or RNA, template, which binds to the telomere, and a catalytic 
 7


subunit with reverse transcriptase activity, which adds a specific DNA sequence to the chromosome ends. The 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Drs. Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack Szostak, former Geron collaborators, for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by both telomeres and telomerase.
 Telomerase is active during embryonic development, enabling the rapid cell division that supports normal growth. During the latter stages of human fetal development and in adulthood, telomerase is repressed in most cells, and telomere length gradually decreases during a lifetime. In tissues that have a high turnover throughout life, such as blood and gut, telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to enable controlled, self‑limited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural cell aging processes. As the progeny of progenitor cells mature, telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division, preventing uncontrolled proliferation.
 Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer
 Telomerase is upregulated in many tumor progenitor cells, enabling the continued and uncontrolled proliferation of the malignant cells that drive tumor growth and progression. Telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately 90% of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers. Our non-clinical studies, in which the telomerase gene was artificially introduced and expressed in normal cells grown in culture, have suggested that telomerase does not itself cause a normal cell to become malignant. Instead, the sustained upregulation of telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, providing them with the capacity for limitless proliferation. We believe that the sustained upregulation of telomerase is critical for tumor progression as it enables malignant progenitor cells to acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis, or cell death.
 Telomerase Inhibition and Hematologic Malignancies: Inducing Cancer Cell Death
 We believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant stem and progenitor cells, which are believed to be important drivers of tumor growth and progression. We and others have observed in various in vitro and rodent tumor models that inhibiting telomerase: (a) results in telomere shortening and (b) arrests uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. 
 Hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers, are classified according to the precursor cell type. A myeloid hematologic malignancy is a cancer that occurs in the myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells, such as the precursor cells of red blood cells, platelets and certain myeloid white blood cells, such as granulocytes. Myeloid neoplasms include myeloproliferative neoplasms, MDS and AML. Examples of myeloproliferative neoplasms include chronic myeloid leukemia, essential thrombocythemia, or ET, polycythemia vera and MF. These myeloid neoplasms are different from lymphocytic malignancies which typically occur in the lymphoid cell progenitor lineage, such as precursor cells of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. Examples of lymphoid malignancies include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas and multiple myeloma.
 Many myeloid hematologic malignancies, such as ET, MF and MDS, have been shown to arise from malignant stem and progenitor cells that express higher telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres when compared to normal healthy cells. In vitro studies have suggested that tumor cells with short telomeres may be especially sensitive to the anti‑proliferative effects of inhibiting telomerase.
 Imetelstat: The First Telomerase Inhibitor to Advance to Clinical Development
 Imetelstat, our proprietary telomerase inhibitor which was discovered and developed at Geron, was designed to inhibit telomerase in malignant cells with continuously upregulated telomerase. 
 Imetelstat is a lipid conjugated 13‑mer oligonucleotide that we designed to be complementary to and bind with high affinity to the RNA template of telomerase, thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity. Imetelstat does not act as an antisense inhibitor of protein translation. The compound has a proprietary thio‑phosphoramidate backbone, which is designed to provide resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases, thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues, as well as improved binding affinity to its target. To improve the ability of imetelstat to penetrate cellular membranes, we conjugated the oligonucleotide to a lipid group. Imetelstat’s IC50, or half maximal inhibitory concentration, is 0.5 – 10 nM in cell free assays. Single‑dose kinetics in patients has shown dose‑dependent increases in exposure to imetelstat, with a plasma half‑life, which is the time it takes for the concentration or amount of imetelstat to be reduced by half, ranging from 4 – 5 hours. Data from animal studies and clinical trials have suggested that the residence time of imetelstat in bone marrow is long, with 0.19 – 0.51 µM observed at 41 – 45 hours after a 7.5 
 8


mg/kg dose in patients. Imetelstat also has been shown in non-clinical studies to exhibit relatively preferential inhibition of the clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor cells compared to normal progenitor cells. For these reasons, imetelstat has been studied as a potential treatment for malignant diseases.
 We believe imetelstat is the first telomerase inhibitor to advance to clinical development. The Phase 1 trials that we completed evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of imetelstat. We established doses and dosing schedules that were tolerable and achieved target exposures in patients that were consistent with those required for efficacy in animal models. Following intravenous administration of imetelstat using tolerable dosing regimens, clinically relevant and significant inhibition of telomerase activity was observed in various types of tissue in which telomerase activity is measurable, including normal bone marrow hematopoietic cells, malignant plasma cells, hair follicle cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dose‑limiting toxicities included thrombocytopenia, or reduced platelet count, and neutropenia, or reduced neutrophil count.
 Proof‑of‑Concept of Imetelstat’s Disease‑Modifying Potential
 We believe that imetelstat may have the potential to suppress the proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells while transiently affecting normal cells. Early clinical data from a Phase 2 trial of imetelstat in patients with ET, or the ET Trial, and a pilot study of imetelstat in patients with MF conducted at Mayo Clinic, or the Pilot Study, suggest imetelstat inhibits the progenitor cells of the malignant clones believed to be responsible for the underlying diseases in a relatively select manner, indicating potential disease-modifying activity. These data were published in two separate articles in a September 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. 
 Reported adverse events, or AEs, and laboratory investigations associated with imetelstat in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study included cytopenias, gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and hepatic biochemistry abnormalities. Dose‑limiting toxicities, such as profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and other safety issues, including death, were observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study. In those trials, such myelosuppression was managed by dose holds and modification rules.
 Lead Indication in Phase 3 Clinical Development: Lower Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
 Unmet Medical Need in Lower Risk MDS for Broad and Durable Transfusion Independence 
 MDS is a group of blood disorders in which the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells produces multiple malignant cell clones in the bone marrow resulting in disordered and ineffective production of the myeloid lineage, which includes red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In MDS, bone marrow and peripheral blood cells may have abnormal, or dysplastic, cell morphology. MDS is frequently characterized clinically by severe anemia, or low red blood cell counts, and low hemoglobin. In addition, other peripheral cytopenias, or low numbers of white blood cells and platelets, may cause life‑threatening infections and bleeding. Transformation to AML occurs in up to 30% of MDS cases and results in poorer overall survival.
 MDS is the most common of the myeloid malignancies. There are approximately 60,000 people in the U.S. living with the disease and approximately 16,000 reported new cases of MDS in the U.S. every year. MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with median age at diagnosis around 70 years. The majority of patients, approximately 70%, fall into what are considered to be the lower risk groups at diagnosis, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System that assigns relative risk of progression to AML and overall survival by taking into account the presence of a number of disease factors, such as cytopenias and cytogenetics.
 Chronic anemia is the predominant clinical problem in patients who have lower risk MDS. Typically, these patients are treated with ESAs, such as erythropoietin, or EPO. Although ESAs provide an improvement in anemia in approximately 50% of patients, the effect is transient with a median duration of response of approximately two years. Once ESAs fail for patients, HMAs and lenalidomide have been used to improve anemia, but with limited success, such as reported 8-week red blood cell transfusion independence, or RBC-TI, rates of 17% for azacitidine, an HMA, and 27% for lenalidomide. In April 2020, a new drug, Reblozyl (luspatercept) was approved for use in a subgroup of lower risk MDS patients – those with ringed sideroblasts. Such patients comprise approximately 15% to 30% of all lower risk MDS patients. The majority of patients who do not have ringed sideroblasts or who no longer respond to ESAs or other available drug therapies become dependent on red blood cell transfusions due to low hemoglobin. Serial red blood cell transfusions can lead to elevated levels of iron in the blood and other tissues, which the body has no normal way to eliminate. Iron overload is a potentially dangerous condition. Published studies in patients with MDS have shown that iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions is associated with a poorer overall survival and a higher risk of developing AML. We believe that, to date, no drug therapy has been shown prospectively to alter or delay the course of the disease in any human clinical trial.

IMerge: Ongoing Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial in Lower Risk MDS
 Trial Design
 IMerge is a two-part Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating imetelstat (7.5 mg/kg dose administered as an intravenous infusion every four weeks) in transfusion dependent lower risk MDS patients who are relapsed after or refractory to prior treatment with an ESA. To be eligible for IMerge, patients are required to be transfusion dependent, defined as requiring at least four units of packed red blood cells, or RBCs, over an eight-week period during the 16 weeks prior to entry into the trial. 
 IMerge Phase 3 is a double-blind, 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that, based on discussions with U.S. and European regulatory authorities, is designed to support, if successful, the registration of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 170 patients with lower risk transfusion dependent MDS who are relapsed or refractory to an ESA, have not received prior treatment with either a HMA or lenalidomide and are non-del(5q). IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted at over 100 medical centers globally, including North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Further information on IMerge Phase 3, including the trial design, patient eligibility criteria and locations of clinical sites, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint of IMerge Phase 3 is the rate of RBC-TI lasting at least eight weeks, defined as the proportion of patients without any RBC transfusion during any consecutive eight weeks since entry to the trial, or 8-week RBC-TI rate. IMerge Phase 3 is designed with >85% power to detect a statistically significant difference in 8-week RBC-TI rate between imetelstat and placebo (one-sided alpha=0.025) such as, for exemplary purposes only, an 8-week RBC-TI rate of 30% for the imetelstat arm and 7.5% for the placebo arm. Top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 may differ from this example. 
 Key secondary endpoints for IMerge Phase 3 include the rate of RBC-TI lasting at least 24 weeks, or 24-week RBC-TI rate, and the rate of hematologic improvement erythroid, or HI-E, which is a rise in hemoglobin of at least 1.5 g/dL above the pretreatment level for at least eight weeks or a reduction of at least four units of RBC transfusions over eight weeks compared with the prior RBC transfusion burden. Other secondary efficacy endpoints include the time to and duration of RBC-TI; the proportion of patients achieving Complete Response, or CR, or Partial Response, or PR, according to the 2006 International Working Group, or IWG, criteria for MDS; the proportion of patients requiring RBC transfusions and the transfusion burden; the proportion of patients requiring the use of myeloid growth factors and the dose; assessments of the change in the patients’ quality of life using several validated instruments; as well as an assessment of OS and time to progression to AML. 
 Current Status of IMerge Phase 3
 In October 2021, we completed patient enrollment in IMerge Phase 3. To enable an earlier clinical cut-off date for the data to be used for the primary analysis of safety and efficacy of imetelstat, including durability of transfusion independence, we shortened the protocol-specified follow-up period after the last patient was enrolled from 15 months to 12 months. Based on current planning assumptions, we project top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 will be available in early January 2023. Our ability to conduct and complete IMerge Phase 3, including reporting top-line results, depends on whether we can maintain the relevant clearances from regulatory authorities and other institutions to conduct and complete the trial, and our ability to raise additional capital to reach top-line results in the trial if such results are not available until after the end of the first quarter of 2023.
 Broad and Durable Transfusion Independence and Potential Disease-Modifying Activity Observed in IMerge Phase 2 
 IMerge Phase 2 is an open label, single-arm trial to assess the safety and efficacy of imetelstat in transfusion dependent lower risk MDS patients relapsed or refractory to ESAs. The primary and secondary endpoints in IMerge Phase 2 are identical to IMerge Phase 3.
 We reported more mature data from 38 patients in IMerge Phase 2 in June 2020. As reported previously, 42% (16/38) of patients achieved the primary endpoint of 8-week RBC-TI, and 75% (12/16) of these patients showed a hemoglobin rise of at least 3 g/dL during the transfusion free interval when compared to pretreatment level. Another important observation was the durability of transfusion independence, including 29% (11/38) of patients being transfusion-free for more than one year, and a median duration of transfusion independence of approximately 20 months. We believe such durability would provide significant and meaningful clinical benefit to lower risk MDS patients, given their chronic anemia and the debilitating impact of serial RBC transfusions, and suggests potential recovery of normal blood cell production. Additionally, transfusion independence and hematologic 
 10


improvement-erythroid responses, or HI-E, were reported across different patient subgroups, including by ringed sideroblast, or RS, sub-type, baseline transfusion burden and serum erythropoietin levels.
 Importantly, we observed depletion of cytogenetic abnormalities and reductions in mutations associated with lower risk MDS, and these data have been correlated with transfusion independence. We believe the durability of transfusion independence, molecular data and correlations from IMerge Phase 2 provide strong evidence of disease modification potential of imetelstat treatment, which we believe differentiates imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for lower risk MDS.
 The safety profile in IMerge Phase 2 was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified. Reversible and manageable Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenias and neutropenias were reported in 61% and 55% of the patients, respectively, without significant clinical consequences. 2/38 patients (5%) had Grade 3 febrile neutropenia. 4/38 patients (11%) had Grade 3/4 bleeding. Furthermore, 90% of the observed Grade 3/4 neutropenias and 87% of the observed Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenias resolved to Grade 2 or lower by laboratory assessment within four weeks. Grade 3/4 anemia was reported in 8/38 patients (21%); however, only one was assessed as related to imetelstat. 
 IMerge Phase 2 is closed to new patient enrollment, and no patients remain in the treatment phase of the trial. Remaining patients in IMerge Phase 2 are being followed in accordance with the clinical trial protocol.
 Second Indication in Phase 3 Clinical Development: Myelofibrosis (MF)
 Unmet Medical Need in Refractory MF for Improvement in Overall Survival
 MF, a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, is a chronic blood cancer in which abnormal or malignant precursor cells in the bone marrow proliferate rapidly, causing scar tissue, or fibrosis, to form. As a result, normal blood production in the bone marrow is impaired and may shift to other organs, such as the spleen and liver, which can cause them to enlarge substantially. People with MF may have abnormally low or high numbers of circulating RBCs, white blood cells or platelets, and abnormally high numbers of immature cells in the blood or bone marrow. MF patients can also suffer from debilitating constitutional symptoms, such as drenching night sweats, fatigue, severe itching, or pruritus, abdominal pain, fever and bone pain. There are approximately 13,000 patients living with MF in the U.S. and approximately 3,000 reported new cases each year. Up to 20% of patients with MF develop AML.
 Approximately 70% of MF patients are classified as having Intermediate‑2 or High-risk disease, as defined by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus described in a 2011 Journal of Clinical Oncology article. Drug therapies currently approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for treating these MF patients include JAK inhibitors, ruxolitinib and fedratinib, as well as pacritinib, a kinase inhibitor. Currently, no drug therapy is approved for those patients who fail or no longer respond to JAK inhibitor treatment, and median survival for MF patients after discontinuation from ruxolitinib is only approximately 14 – 16 months, representing a significant unmet medical need.
IMpactMF: Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Refractory MF
 IMpactMF, our Phase 3 clinical trial in refractory MF, is an open label, 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate imetelstat (9.4 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion over two hours every three weeks) in approximately 320 patients. Patients refractory to a JAK inhibitor are defined as having an inadequate spleen response or symptom response after treatment with a JAK inhibitor for at least six months, including an optimal dose of a JAK inhibitor for at least two months. The best available therapy, or BAT, control arm of IMpactMF excludes use of JAK inhibitors. With respect to the trial design for IMpactMF, the FDA urged us to consider adding a third dosing arm to assess a lower dose and/or a more frequent dosing schedule that might improve the planned trial’s chance of success by identifying a less toxic regimen and/or more effective spleen response, one of the trial’s secondary endpoints. Based on data from IMbark, we believe that testing a lower dose regimen would likely result in a lower median OS, which is the trial’s primary endpoint, in the imetelstat treatment arm. Existing data also suggest that lowering the dose would not result in a clinically meaningful reduction in toxicity. For these reasons, we therefore determined not to add a third dosing arm to the trial design, and the FDA did not object to our proposed imetelstat dose and schedule of 9.4 mg/kg every three weeks. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint for IMpactMF is OS. Key secondary endpoints include symptom response; spleen response; progression free survival; complete remission, partial remission or clinical improvement, as defined by the International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment criteria; duration of response; safety; pharmacokinetics; and patient reported outcomes. Currently, we expect to engage over 180 sites to 
 11


participate in IMpactMF across North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Further information on IMpactMF, including the trial design, patient eligibility criteria and locations of clinical sites, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov. 
 IMpactMF is designed with >85% power to detect a 40% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio=0.60; one-sided alpha=0.025), such as, for exemplary purposes only, 23 months for the imetelstat arm and 14 months for the BAT arm. Results from interim or final analyses from IMpactMF may differ from this example. The final analysis for OS is planned to be conducted after more than 50% of the patients planned to be enrolled in the trial have died (each death referred to herein as an “event”). An interim analysis of OS, in which the alpha spend is expected to be approximately 0.01, is planned to be conducted after approximately 70% of the total projected number of events for the final analysis have occurred. Both the planned interim and final analyses are event driven and could occur on different timelines than we currently expect.
 Current Status of IMpactMF
 IMpactMF opened for patient screening and enrollment in December 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had 96 sites open for patient enrollment. The first patient was dosed in April 2021. Given the uncertain and unpredictable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trial activities, including the constraints on clinical site personnel resources due to other competing trials in MF at the sites where IMpactMF is planned to be conducted, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. In addition, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF may occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. At the interim analysis, if the pre-specified statistical OS criterion is met, then we expect such data may support the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Subject to protocol-specified stopping rules for futility, if the pre-specified OS criterion is not met at the interim analysis, the trial will continue to the final analysis, which is expected to occur approximately one year later. 
 The timing and achievement of either or both of the planned analyses depend on numerous factors, including delays or interruptions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or geopolitical events. In addition, our ability to enroll, conduct and complete IMpactMF depends on whether we can obtain and maintain the relevant clearances from regulatory authorities and other institutions to enroll, conduct and complete the trial, and our ability to raise additional capital in order to complete the trial.
 Improvement in Overall Survival and Potential Disease-Modifying Activity Observed in IMbark Phase 2 
 The IMbark Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to evaluate two dosing regimens of imetelstat (either 4.7 mg/kg or 9.4 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks) in patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. The co-primary efficacy endpoints for IMbark were spleen response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a reduction of at least 35% in spleen volume as assessed by imaging, and symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a reduction of at least 50% in Total Symptom Score, at 24 weeks. Key secondary endpoints were OS and safety. 
 We previously reported efficacy and safety data from the IMbark Phase 2 clinical trial, including median OS of 28.1 months for patients on the high dose arm of the study, which is almost twice the reported median OS of 14 – 16 months in medical literature. To evaluate this benefit, we conducted an analysis of OS for patients treated with imetelstat 9.4 mg/kg in IMbark compared to OS calculated from real world data, or RWD, collected at the Moffitt Cancer Center for patients who had discontinued treatment with ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, and who were subsequently treated with BAT. To make a comparison between the IMbark data and RWD, a cohort from the real-world dataset was identified that closely matched the IMbark patients, using guidelines for inclusion and exclusion criteria as defined in the IMbark clinical protocol, such as platelet count and spleen size. Calculations from two propensity score analysis approaches resulted in a median OS of 30.7 months for the imetelstat-treated patients from IMbark, which is more than double the median OS of 12.0 months using RWD for patients treated with BAT. These analyses also indicated a 65% – 67% lower risk of death for the imetelstat-treated patients vs. BAT-treated patients. We believe these analyses suggest potentially favorable OS for imetelstat-treated relapsed/refractory MF patients in IMbark, compared to BAT in closely-matched patients from RWD.
 In IMbark, patients also experienced other clinical benefits, including symptom improvement, spleen reduction and bone marrow fibrosis improvement. In June 2020, we reported correlation analyses from IMbark that showed a trend of longer OS in patients who achieved symptom response, spleen volume reductions and improved bone marrow fibrosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the reductions in the variant allele frequency of key driver mutations in MF and the improvement in bone marrow fibrosis observed in IMbark have also been correlated to the improvement in OS. We believe the improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, potential survival benefit, molecular data 
 12


and correlations from IMbark provide strong evidence of disease modification potential of imetelstat treatment, which we believe differentiates imetelstat from currently approved and investigational treatments for MF. 
 The safety profile in IMbark was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified. In the 9.4 mg/kg arm, reversible and manageable Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 24/59 patients (41%) and 19/59 patients (32%), respectively, without significant clinical consequences. 1/59 patients (2%) had Grade 3 febrile neutropenia. 3/59 patients (5%) had Grade 3/4 bleeding. Furthermore, more than 70% of the observed Grade 3/4 cytopenias resolved to Grade 2 or lower by laboratory assessment within four weeks.
 Planned Exploratory Clinical Trials in Additional Indications
 IMproveMF: Phase 1 Combination Clinical Trial in Frontline Myelofibrosis (Frontline MF)
 IMproveMF is designed as a two-part Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating imetelstat in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with frontline MF. The planned trial is designed to use a Bayesian Optimal Interval design to test various doses of imetelstat in an escalating dose sequence with a defined number of patients per dosing arm. Escalation to the next higher dosing arm will only occur if the prior dose is tolerable to the patients. The primary objective of the first part of IMproveMF is to identify a dosing regimen that is safe. Up to 20 patients are expected to be enrolled into the first part of IMproveMF, or IMproveMF Part 1.
 Upon identification of a tolerable dosing regimen for the combination treatment of imetelstat and ruxolitinib, the second part of IMproveMF, or IMproveMF Part 2, is planned to evaluate the efficacy and confirm the safety of that dosing regimen. Under IMproveMF Part 2, the primary endpoints are safety and symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a >50% reduction in Total Symptom Score at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints include change in fibrosis; spleen response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a >35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline as assessed by imaging; and the number of patients achieving complete remission, partial remission or clinical improvement, as defined by the International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment criteria. Up to 20 patients are expected to be enrolled into the IMproveMF Part 2.
 We plan to conduct IMproveMF at three clinical sites in the U.S. with the first clinical site expected to open for enrollment in the first half of 2022. 
 Investigator-Led Clinical Trials in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (Higher Risk MDS)
 We are planning to explore the potential utility of imetelstat in AML and higher risk MDS. At previous medical conferences, we have reported non-clinical data in AML cell lines, mouse models and AML patient samples. Based on these non-clinical data, we believe imetelstat has the potential to be used as a single agent and in combination with other drugs commonly used to treat AML and higher risk MDS.
 To enable our internal resources to remain focused on our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials, we plan to collaborate with key opinion leaders in the fields of AML and higher risk MDS to conduct potential investigator-led clinical trials in AML and higher risk MDS, either using imetelstat as a single agent or in combination with other drugs that are the standards of care. We expect these planned investigator-led clinical trials to begin in 2022.
 Research Programs
 Preclinical Lymphoid Hematologic Malignancy Program
 Academic research data suggests that certain lymphoid hematologic malignancies have higher telomerase activity and shorter telomeres when compared to normal healthy cells. Thus, we believe a telomerase inhibition approach may find utility in this disease setting.
 Based on this scientific hypothesis, we have initiated a preclinical research project with MD Anderson Cancer Center to determine the potential application of imetelstat in lymphoid hematologic malignancies. We expect preliminary results from this research in 2022.
 13


Next Generation Telomerase Inhibitor Discovery Program
 We have initiated a discovery program to identify a lead compound as a potential next generation oral telomerase inhibitor. If such a compound is identified, we plan to conduct preclinical experiments that may serve as a basis for potential future clinical testing. Discovery research is an uncertain and unpredictable process. As such, the timing and nature of any results from this discovery effort are difficult to forecast. If we select a lead compound from this discovery program, we expect to provide an update on our efforts at that time.
 Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
 As of the date of this filing, uncertainty continues to exist concerning the ultimate duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2021 and early in 2022, COVID-19 cases were increasing due to the spread of COVID-19 variants, including the Delta and Omicron variants, leading to the re-implementation of mask restrictions, social distancing and other restrictions in many regions. In addition, the variable process of vaccine distribution, including booster shots, in some countries and the concern over further waves of infections are causing continued unpredictability and uncertainty about the pace at which clinical trial operations may normalize, especially given the diversion of healthcare resources to care for COVID-19 patients. 
 Even though we have completed patient enrollment in IMerge Phase 3, the pace of enrollment was slower than planned. For IMpactMF, in addition to the negative impact of COVID-19, site personnel resources remain constrained in the countries where we planned to conduct the trial due to the number of competing trials in MF and other oncology indications. To address these challenges, we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct IMpactMF. We continue to monitor each clinical site through our contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as conduct direct outreach to investigators and study staff. In addition, we plan to implement the same enrollment-boosting activities for IMpactMF that we employed for IMerge Phase 3, including engaging clinical science liaisons. Given the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF may occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. 
 Due to the dynamic and unpredictable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had and expect to continue to have disruptions and/or delays in our imetelstat development program, including with respect to our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, maintain patient enrollment, ensure patient visits to clinical sites and laboratories, conduct monitoring visits, supply study drug, report trial results, and interact with regulators or other important agencies due to limitations in employee resources or otherwise. Restrictions on travel, availability of site personnel, and diversion of hospital staff and resources to COVID-19 patients have disrupted our trial operations, as well as patient recruitment in many areas, resulting in a slowdown in patient enrollment and/or deviations from or disruptions in key clinical trial activities, such as clinical site initiation and monitoring. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue and persist for an extended period of time and/or become more severe, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, continued delays in patient enrollment in IMpactMF and potentially in IMproveMF and planned investigator-led clinical trials in AML and higher risk MDS, and other disruptions that could severely impact our business and the imetelstat development program.
 We have taken and intend to take those actions with regard to COVID-19 that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our patients, investigators, employees and stockholders. We have allowed limited voluntary access to our offices in California and New Jersey to employees and consultants who have been vaccinated, and almost all of our employees continue to work remotely without any significant disruption to our business. We plan to continue to evaluate our business operations based on new information as it becomes available regarding the pandemic and will make changes that we consider necessary in light of any new developments.
 All plans and timing expectations will be delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial and other development activities. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to COVID-19” described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
 Intellectual property, including patent protection, is very important to our business. We file patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect aspects of our business. An enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics, and so the future commercial success of imetelstat, and therefore our future success, will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy. 
 14


The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property” described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 Our intellectual property strategy includes the early development of a technology, such as imetelstat, followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and uses thereof, manufacturing processes, product formulation and methods of treatment and administration. The result of this process is that products in development are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during the development process and cover different aspects of the product. Consequently, earlier filed, broad technology patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments, such as product formulations and methods of treatment and administration, so that patent expirations on a product may span several years. Patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection. There are also opportunities to obtain an extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries, which adds further complexity to the determination of patent life.
 From time to time, we may endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business. Based on this monitoring, we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests. Such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate, filing oppositions against a patent, filing a request for post grant review against a patent or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a patent application or issued patent.
 Imetelstat
 We have global rights to imetelstat. We own issued patents related to imetelstat in the U.S., Europe and other countries. Composition of matter patents generally provide the most material coverage, and therefore may convey competitive advantages. Because imetelstat is still under development, subsequent innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage with later expiration dates. Examination of overseas patent applications typically lags behind U.S. examination, particularly where cases are filed first in the U.S. It may be possible to obtain patent term extensions of some patents in some countries for claims covering imetelstat, which could further extend the patent term.
 We have issued U.S. and European patents that provide patent coverage into 2033 pertaining to the treatment of MF and MDS with imetelstat. We also hold issued U.S. and European patents covering imetelstat composition of matter. 
 In the U.S., our composition of matter patent coverage extends until December 2025, and our method of treatment patent rights for MDS and MF expire in March 2033. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, upon receipt of drug product approval, potential patent term extensions, if any, may be available to extend the patent term of either our composition of matter patent, or our method of treatment patent for MDS, in the U.S. 
 In Europe, our composition of matter patent coverage expires in September 2024, and our method of treatment patent rights for MDS and MF expire in November 2033 in member countries of the European Patent Convention. One of our patents in each member country of the European Patent Convention may be eligible for patent term extension under the European SPC Regulation, upon receipt of drug product approval, such as, for example, our method of treatment patent for MDS. Our patent rights relating to imetelstat also include reagents useful in manufacturing processes for the drug, and method of treatment and kit claims, certain of which are co‑owned with other entities. 
 If regulatory approval of imetelstat occurs after a patent has expired, we may be unable to obtain any patent term extension of that expired patent, and the scope of our patent rights will be limited. In addition, should we seek such a patent term extension, we may not be granted any such patent term extension and/or the applicable time period of such patent term extension could be less than five years. Moreover, in some countries, including the U.S., the scope of protection for claims under such patent term extensions, if any, does not extend to the full scope of the claims but is limited to the product composition as approved. Thus, if we were to receive drug product approval in the U.S. for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the first half of 2024, we may potentially extend the term of our product composition claims in the U.S. for a maximum of five years until December 2030, subject to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, approval. If we do not receive a patent term extension for our U.S. composition of matter patent for imetelstat, our U.S. composition of matter patent will expire in December 2025. If we do not receive marketing approval and submit a request for an SPC before our composition of matter patents expire in countries of the European Economic Area, or EEA, our imetelstat composition of matter patents will expire in September 2024. If we receive drug product approval in Europe for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the second half of 2024, we may potentially extend the term of our patents in the EEA for the method of treatment of MDS for a maximum of five years, from 
 15


November 2033 until November 2038, subject to European Patent Office approval. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect imetelstat, our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat would be materially and adversely affected, which might cause us to cease operations.
 Upon the effective date of termination of the license and collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, on September 28, 2018, we regained global rights to imetelstat and are continuing development of imetelstat on our own. In accordance with the termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide license for intellectual property developed under the Collaboration Agreement for the further development of imetelstat, without any economic obligations to Janssen with respect to such license. Janssen has assigned to us certain intellectual property developed by it under the Collaboration Agreement. We now are responsible for the costs of maintaining, prosecuting and litigating all imetelstat intellectual property that we own.
 Market Exclusivity and Orphan Drug Designation
For a drug to qualify for orphan drug designation by the FDA, both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, and FDA’s implementing regulations. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products in order to support development of medicines for underserved or rare diseases and patient populations that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals annually in the U.S., if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the ODA, including, if regulatory approval is received, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity with certain limited exceptions and certain tax credits for qualified clinical testing. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for a disease or condition other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was granted orphan drug designation. The granting of orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. The safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well‑controlled studies. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 In June 2015 and December 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, respectively.
 In the U.S., under the Hatch-Waxman Act, upon drug product approval a new chemical entity is entitled to four years of data exclusivity and one year of market exclusivity, conferring a total of five years exclusivity, or NCE exclusivity, for the first-approved indication. Thus, if we receive drug product approval for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the first half of 2024, we expect that we may receive exclusivity in lower risk MDS under the Hatch-Waxman Act until the first half of 2029. In addition, under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, orphan drug designation confers market exclusivity in the designated indication for seven years after drug product approval. Thus, if we receive drug product approval for imetelstat in the U.S. for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the first half of 2024, we anticipate that we may receive market exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act of 1982 in the U.S. until the first half of 2031.
 In addition, a six-month pediatric extension may be available in the U.S. pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, to the longest extension or exclusivity period available under any of a patent term extension, the NCE exclusivity period or the orphan drug exclusivity period. 
 In Europe, orphan drug designation by the European Commission provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In the EU, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, as well as protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. In addition, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug product approval, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in the EU. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable to not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 In December 2015 and July 2020, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, respectively. 
 16


In Europe, under the European Union Data Exclusivity Directive 2004/27/EC, upon drug product approval a new medicinal product is entitled to eight years of data exclusivity and two years of market exclusivity, conferring a total of ten years of exclusivity for the first-approved indication. Thus, if we receive drug product approval in Europe for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the second half of 2024, we anticipate receiving a total of ten years of exclusivity for lower risk MDS, until the second half of 2034. Separately, orphan drug designation under the European Union Orphan drug regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 confers market exclusivity for ten years following drug product approval for each of the orphan disease indications. Thus, if we receive drug product approval in Europe for imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the second half of 2024 and we maintain orphan drug designation, we anticipate that we may receive market exclusivity in Europe for imetelstat in lower risk MDS until the second half of 2034. In addition, if we fulfill the pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the European Medicines Agency, such market exclusivity may be extended for an additional two years under the European Pediatric Regulation, which may enable us to receive market exclusivity in Europe for imetelstat in lower risk MDS for an additional two years, until the second half of 2036. Further, if we receive drug product approval in Europe for imetelstat for refractory MF, and we maintain orphan drug designation, we anticipate that we may receive ten years exclusivity in Europe for refractory MF following drug product approval, if any.
 Fast Track Designation
 Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, Fast Track designation does not accelerate conduct of clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that imetelstat will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the imetelstat clinical development program.
 In October 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an ESA. 
 In September 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory MF.
 Licensing
 In September 2016, we granted a license to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an affiliate of Janssen, for the research, development and commercialization of products based on specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry and novel amidates for disorders, excluding cancers originating from the blood or bone marrow. In connection with this license, we also granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals a non-exclusive worldwide license under our patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, which are the building blocks of oligonucleotides. Janssen Pharmaceuticals has terminated the license, and termination was effective as of April 12, 2021. Upon the effective date of termination, all patent rights originally conveyed under the license reverted to Geron.
 We previously granted patent licenses to a number of other organizations to utilize aspects of our technologies to develop and commercialize products outside of the imetelstat program; however, all of our patent license agreements related to our telomerase technology have now expired or been terminated, and we expect no further revenue under such agreements in the future.
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenues” included in Part II, Item 7, of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenues from our license agreements. 
 Manufacturing
 A typical sequence of steps in the manufacture of imetelstat drug product includes the following key components:
  
• | starting materials, which are well‑defined raw materials that are used to make bulk drug substance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | bulk drug substance, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug product that provides pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the treatment of disease; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | final drug product, which is the finished dosage form that contains the drug substance that is shipped to the clinic for patient treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since September 2018, we have engaged third‑party contract manufacturers and have re-established our own manufacturing supply chain to manufacture and supply additional quantities of imetelstat that meet applicable regulatory standards for current and potential future clinical trials and potential commercial uses. 
 We do not have direct control over third‑party personnel or operations. These third‑party contract manufacturers, and/or any other third parties that we may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, typically complete their services on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements and may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production. These third‑party contract manufacturers, and/or any other third parties that we may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, may not be able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at a commercially reasonable cost. We are responsible for establishing any long‑term commitments or commercial supply agreements with any of the third‑party contract manufacturers for imetelstat. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Manufacturing Imetelstat” under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by intense and dynamic competition with rapidly advancing technologies and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry; experience with the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, telomeres and telomerase; clinical data to date indicating potential disease-modifying activity with imetelstat treatment; and knowledge and expertise around the development of potential treatments for myeloid hematologic malignancies provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Imetelstat will compete, if approved, with other products and therapies that currently exist, are being developed or will in the future be developed, some of which we may not currently be aware of.
 Competition in Lower Risk MDS
 The current standard of care for the treatment of lower risk MDS is the use of ESAs to address the patient’s chronic anemia. Once ESAs are no longer effective, serial blood transfusions are often administered that can cause damaging effects to other organs due to iron overload, resulting in shorter survival. In addition, other best available therapies are used without durable effect for the patient.
 In lower risk MDS, data from IMerge Phase 2 suggest potentially meaningful and durable transfusion independence, activity across MDS patient subtypes, and potential disease-modifying activity achievable with imetelstat treatment. We believe that these key features are differentiators compared to currently approved products as well as investigational drugs currently in clinical development. 
 If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of currently existing therapies, including ESAs and other hematopoietic growth factors that are indicated for anemia; immunomodulators, such as Revlimid (lenalidomide) by Celgene Corporation, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation, or Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as Vidaza (azacitidine) by Celgene and manufacturers of generic azacitidine; Dacogen (decitabine) by Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. and other manufacturers in the U.S. and Janssen in the EU; Inqovi (oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine) by Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Astex; and Reblozyl (luspatercept), a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron (acquired by Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, in November 2021), in collaboration with Celgene.
 Other therapies currently in Phase 3 development in lower risk MDS, some of which may obtain regulatory approval earlier than imetelstat include roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, by FibroGen, Inc.
 18


In addition, there are multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of other agents being developed for lower risk MDS, including but not limited to: LB‐100, a PP2A inhibitor, by Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc.; bemcentinib, an AXL inhibitor, by BerGenBio ASA; H3B‐8800, a spliceosome inhibitor, by H3 Biomedicine, Inc.; KER-050, a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Keros Therapeutics, Inc., or Keros Therapeutics; TP-0184, an inhibitor of ALK2 or ACVR1 kinase, by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Oncology, Inc; ilginatinib (NS-018), a JAK2 inhibitor, by NS Pharma, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., or NS Pharma; RVT-2001, a SF3B1 modulator, by Roivant Sciences Ltd.; sabatolimab (MBG453), a TIM-3 inhibitor, by Novartis AG; a lower dose of ASTX727, an oral formulation of decitabine and cedazuridine, referred to as ASTX727 LD, by Astex; ASTX030, an oral formulation of azacitidine and cedazuridine, by Astex; and a combination treatment regimen of luspatercept and lenalidomide by Bristol Myers Squibb Corporation.
 Competition in Refractory MF
 The current standard of care for the treatment of Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF is the use of JAK inhibitors, to address the patient’s symptoms. Once JAK inhibitors fail or are no longer effective, a variety of best available therapies are used since there are no approved treatments for this patient population and median OS is 14 – 16 months after discontinuation from the predominant JAK inhibitor being used today.
 In Intermediate-2 or High-risk relapsed/refractory MF, data from IMbark suggest potential disease-modifying activity with imetelstat treatment and a potential meaningful improvement in OS, which is supported in a comparison to real-world data. 
 If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against currently approved JAK inhibitors: Jakafi (ruxolitinib) by Incyte Corporation and Inrebic (fedratinib) by Celgene, as well as a kinase inhibitor, Vonjo (pacritinib), by CTI Biopharma, which was recently approved for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 × 109/L. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include ESAs, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. 
 Other therapies currently in Phase 3 development in MF, some of which may obtain regulatory approval earlier than imetelstat include momelotinib, a JAK inhibitor, by Sierra Oncology, Inc., or Sierra Oncology; or momelotinib plus AZD5153, a BET inhibitor in-licensed by Sierra Oncology from AstraZeneca in August 2021; pelabresib (CPI-0610), a BET inhibitor, by Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (acquired by MorphoSys AG in June 2021); navitoclax, a BCLXL, BCL-2 and BCLW inhibitor, by AbbVie, Inc.; and parsaclisib, a PI3K delta inhibitor, by Incyte Corporation. Other approaches for MF currently under investigation that could compete with imetelstat in the future include luspatercept, a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Acceleron (acquired by Merck in November 2021), in collaboration with Celgene; PRM-151, an anti-fibrosis antibody, by Promedior, Inc. (acquired by Roche in February 2020); LCL-161, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), by Novartis; KRT-232, an inhibitor of MDM2, by Kartos Therapeutics, Inc.; GB2064, a LOXL2 inhibitor, by Galecto Biotech; elraglusib (9-ING-41), a glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitor, by Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.; XPOVIO (selinexor), a nuclear export inhibitor, by Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc.; TL-895, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, by Telios Pharma, Inc.; IMG-7289, a LSD1 inhibitor, by Imago Biosciences, Inc.; APG-1252, a dual BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor, by Ascentage Pharma; ilginatinib (NS-018), a JAK2 inhibitor by NS Pharma; and KER-050, an engineered ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of the TGF-beta receptor in combination with ruxolitinib, by Keros Therapeutics.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, could have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. We believe that the commercial success of imetelstat is subject to a number of factors, including: product efficacy and safety; method of product administration; cost of manufacturing; the timing and scope of regulatory consents; status of coverage and reimbursement; price; the level of generic competition; and our patent position.
 19


Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for myeloid hematologic malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program.
 As a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we may be able to achieve with imetelstat. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what we may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause us to cease any further development or future commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.
 Government Regulation
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and potential future marketing of imetelstat. Imetelstat will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, potential human therapeutic products, such as imetelstat, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, import, export, distribution and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted. Moreover, compliance with government regulations governing personal information and information security requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled “Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat” and “Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat” under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Approval Process
 Prior to commencement of clinical trials involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of a product candidate. The results of these trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any time, which prevents the conduct of clinical trials under the IND until safety concerns or questions are addressed by the IND sponsor to the FDA’s satisfaction. 
 Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase trial process. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients afflicted with a specific disease to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. The Phase 2 trials can be conducted comparing the investigational treatment to a comparator arm, or not. If used, a comparator usually includes standard of care therapy. Safety and efficacy data from Phase 2 clinical trials, even if favorable, may not provide sufficient rationale for proceeding to a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Phase 3, large scale, multi‑center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to provide sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the trials. Human clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations and applicable laws, with the oversight of Institutional Review Boards for the protection of human 
 20


subjects. The manufacture of drug product candidates is subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and applicable laws.
 The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of drugs and complete manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for review and approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, which may be waived in certain cases. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may approve the drug for commercialization, impose limitations on its indications for use and labeling, including in the form of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or may issue a complete response letter. Even if an NDA is approved, its sponsor is subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory compliance requirements.
 European and Other Regulatory Approval Process
 Prior to initiating clinical trials in a region outside of the U.S., a clinical trial application must be submitted and reviewed by the appropriate regulatory authority regulating the country in which the trial will be conducted. Whether or not FDA clearance or approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been cleared or approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the EU and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, provide a mechanism for EU member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established the EMA for the evaluation of medical products, with a centralized procedure which is mandatory for orphan and oncology products and which grants a single marketing authorization valid in all EU member states. 
 In October 2021, we gained access to the ILAP through the receipt of an Innovation Passport for imetelstat to treat lower risk MDS. The ILAP is a new program sponsored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the U.K. post-Brexit. The objective of this new licensing and access pathway is to reduce the time to market and enable earlier patient access for innovative medicines. The Innovation Passport is the first prescribed entry point in the ILAP process. Key benefits of being within ILAP include a 150-day accelerated assessment and rolling review of an MAA, as well as opportunities for frequent interactions with the review staff at the MHRA and its partner agencies to discuss imetelstat’s development, regulatory and reimbursement plans.
 Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 We may also be subject to additional regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third‑party payors. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and healthcare professionals payment sunshine laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti‑Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation.
 21


Federal civil and criminal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and its whistleblower or qui tam provisions that permit private individuals to bring an action on behalf of the government to enforce the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off‑label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information, upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates and their subcontractors that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; and state, federal and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of personal information (including key-coded data and health information), including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or EU GDPR, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements will comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR imposes heightened and codified standards for data subject consent, requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data, mandating data breach notifications to relevant supervisory authority(ies), and mandating the 
 22


appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances. Foreign privacy laws, such as the EU GDPR, also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the applicable jurisdiction. Further, the EU GDPR provides for significant penalties (such as restrictions or prohibitions on personal data processing) and large fines for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed privacy laws, regulations and industry standards in the U.S. As one example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA imposes numerous obligations on covered business. Although the CCPA exempts certain data processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to the personal information we maintain about California residents. See the section titled “We are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations and actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions to our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue and profits; and other adverse business impacts,” under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10 K for additional information about the laws and regulators to which we may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other healthcare, information security and privacy-related regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for imetelstat.
 In the U.S., third‑party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump Administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on 
 23


December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of imetelstat, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, imetelstat may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, as there is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the U.S. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in imetelstat.
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs, as well as to improve quality and expand access. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which included a number of provisions of importance to the biopharmaceutical industry. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. 
 On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. We expect that other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for imetelstat.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 
 24


2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation suspended these reductions from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the U.S. to control the rising cost of healthcare.
