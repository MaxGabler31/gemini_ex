Item 1 – Business
Organization



GreenBox POS is a financial technology company that develops, markets, and sells innovative blockchain-based payment solutions, which we believe offer significant improvements for the payment solutions marketplace. The Company’s core focus is to develop and monetize disruptive blockchain-based applications, integrated within an end-to-end suite of financial products, capable of supporting a multitude of industries. The Company’s proprietary, blockchain-based systems are designed to facilitate, record and store a virtually limitless volume of tokenized assets, representing cash or data, on a secured, immutable blockchain-based ledger.



The Company was formerly known as ASAP Expo, Inc (“ASAP”), and was incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 10, 2007. On January 4, 2020, PubCo and GreenBox POS LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("PrivCo”), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement”), to memorialize a verbal agreement (the “Verbal Agreement”) entered into on April 12, 2018, by and among PubCo (the Buyer) and PrivCo (the Seller). On April 12, 2018, pursuant to the Verbal Agreement, PubCo acquired PrivCo’s blockchain gateway and payment system business, point of sale system business, delivery business and kiosk business, bank and merchant accounts, as well as all intellectual property related thereto (the "GreenBox Business”). As consideration for the GreenBox Business, on April 12, 2018, PubCo assumed PrivCo’s liabilities that had been incurred in the normal course of the GreenBox Business.



On May 3, 2018, PubCo formally changed its name to GreenBox POS LLC, then subsequently changed its name to GreenBox POS on December 13, 2018.



On May 21, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Northeast Merchant Systems, Inc. (“Northeast”) in a transaction treated as a business combination. Northeast is a merchant services company providing merchant credit card processing through their own Bank Identification Number (BIN) with the acquiring bank Merrick. This involves inside operations for new merchants that include sales assistance and applications processing, underwriting, and onboarding; inside operations for existing merchants include risk monitoring and customer service. Outside operations include: equipment service or replacement; sales calls and applications, site inspections and identity verification; security verification; and on-site customer service and technical support.



On July 13, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), GreenBox POS entered into and closed on a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Charge Savvy LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (“Charge Savvy”), and Charge Savvy’s three members (collectively, the “Sellers”). One of the Sellers, Ken Haller, was an employee of the Company on the Closing Date.  As a result of the Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased all of Charge Savvy’s issued and outstanding membership interests from the Sellers and Charge Savvy became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Although the Purchase Agreement is dated July 9th, it was entered into and closed on July 13th.The purchase price under the Purchase Agreement for the all- stock transaction consisted of 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) being issued and delivered to Sellers in proportion to the Sellers’ share of their membership interests in Charge Savvy. The share price at issuance was $12.14. Charge Savvy is a global Fintech company that specializes on developing software and providing payment processing and point of sale services to the merchant services industry. Charge Savvy also owns an approximately 64,000 square foot office building located in Chicago, Illinois where it is headquartered.



Our Business



Payment processing in the blockchain world only requires recording a ledger, there is no movement of money. Secure tokens are used where users need an immediate transaction, in a safe, private, and hack-free environment, and where traditional banks may not work effectively, like cross border transactions or in under-banked verticals.



We generate revenue from payment processing services, licensing fees and equipment sales.




● | Payment processing revenue is based on a percentage of each transaction’s value and/or upon fixed amounts specified per each transaction or service and is recognized as such transactions or services are performed. This is our primary source of revenues. When a merchant makes a sale, the process of receiving the payment card information, engaging the banks for transferring the proceeds to the merchant’s account via digital gateways, and recording the transaction on a blockchain ledger are the activities for which we get to collect fees.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Licensing revenue is paid in advance and is recorded as unearned income, which is amortized monthly over the period of the licensing agreement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equipment revenue is generated from the sale of POS products, which is recognized when goods are shipped.

Our proprietary blockchain-based technology serves as the settlement engine for all transactions within our ecosystem. The blockchain ledger provides a robust and secure platform to log immense volumes of immutable transactional records in real time. Generally speaking, blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses digitally encrypted keys to verify, secure and record details of each transaction conducted within an ecosystem. Unlike general blockchain-based systems, we use proprietary, private ledger technology to verify every transaction conducted within our ecosystem. The verification of transaction data comes from trusted partners, all of whom have been extensively vetted by us.



We facilitate all financial elements of our closed-loop ecosystem and we act as the administrator for all related accounts. Using our TrustGateway technology, we seek authorization and settlement for each transaction from Gateways to the issuing bank responsible for the credit/debit card used in the transaction. When the Gateway settles the transaction, our TrustGateway technology composes a chain of blockchain instructions to our ledger manager system.



When consumers use credit/debit cards to pay for transactions with merchants who use our ecosystem, the transaction starts with the consumer purchasing tokens from us. The tokens are purchased or granted directly from the merchant's terminals or mobile app, or from our website and are immediately available for transactions.



he issuance of tokens is accomplished when we load a virtual wallet with a token, which then transfers credits to the merchant’s wallet on a dollar for dollar basis, after which the merchant releases its goods or services to the consumer. These transfers take place instantaneously and seamlessly, allowing the transaction experience to seem like any other ordinary credit/debit card transaction to the consumer and merchant.



While our blockchain ledger records transaction details instantaneously, the final cash settlement of each transaction can take days to weeks, depending upon contract terms between us and the gateways we use, between us and our Independent Sales Organizations (“ISO”), and between us and/or our ISOs and merchants who use our services. In the case where we have received transaction funds, but not yet paid a merchant or an ISO, we hold funds in either a trust account or as cash deemed restricted within our operating accounts. We record the total of such funds as Cash held for Settlements – this is a current asset. Of these funds, we record the sum balance due to Merchants and ISOs as Settlement Liabilities to Merchants and Settlement Liabilities to ISOs, respectively.



Our primary revenue driver in fiscal year 2021 was the release and utilization of our Gen3 platform. We believe Gen3 is the most advanced technology released in the space to date. The latest installment of our technology, Gen3 features the following new properties: 1. Banking white label platform; 2. Payment Facilitation management platform; 3. Stablecoin platform support; 4. Payment platform; and 5. Ledger Secure Token Technology. We believe Gen3’s holistic end to end capabilities minimize user pain points in onboarding, transactions and offboarding.



In addition, Gen3 is the transactional foundation for the new Secure Token Technology described below.

Currency has two primary roles: it can be transactional, or it can be custodial (reserve). US dollars plays both roles. There are several disadvantages encapsulated within the existing cryptocurrency architectures available today. A decentralized approach makes the crypto assets available for viewing from anywhere and at any time, but they are extremely volatile, hackable, slow to settle, and have no intrinsic value. For the most part, they have a lot of transaction friction, in both time to settlement and transactional or conversion costs. As such, we believe these are not assets suitable as transactional currency, and are questionable as custodial currency. Centralized deployments can be stable (commonly called stablecoin), and are better as custodial media; however, none is attached to a transactional ecosystem, and exchange fees are still high. The USDC, a coin that is a USD digital equivalent, is an example of that.



We have introduced a new kind of media to the mix: Secure Token Technology, called Coyni, which has been available on a private basis since the end of 2021 and we expect will be fully available to the public before the end of 2022. This token is not minted nor mined, but rather it is the equivalent of a contract (an asset class called Smart Contract). As such, Secure Token Technology has many advantages over all other coins and token, and deliver on the features most sought after in the crypto and legacy payment space.




1. | It provides instant settlement;
---+--------------------------------


2. | It is highly secure, since the asset and its value are not held together (asset is decentrally visible but its value is in centralized cold storage);
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | It is deletable – the token can be cancelled;
---+----------------------------------------------


4. | It is reversible (undo-able) allowing for chargebacks in the case of a bad transaction. This allows the token to be kept alive for another transaction by the same user;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | It provides instant liquidity;
---+-------------------------------


6. | It is attached to a regulated custodial account. The custodian will be a regulated bank. And the custodial account will be continuously audited to ensure it has a large enough cash balance to back all tokens in circulation; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | It is attached to our transactional infrastructure. This allows for the token to be usable for instant purchases, which we believe is an advantage for the merchants. These purchases, in turn, generate processing volume for us.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe our Gen3 stabilized platform will be a top choice for banks, e-commerce, and consumers. As a stablecoin platform, it is also the only type of blockchain payment processing platform that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has authorized for use by banks in a similar fashion to ACH, Wire and Swift. Because Secure Token Technology is attached to the value of the US dollar, it is also very good as a custodial vehicle, fitting the needs of low-risk yield seekers, such as pension funds and retirement accounts. We believe our Gen3 stabilized platform, in its stabilized end-to-end deployment, is the obvious tool of choice, without any meaningful competition, for both transactional and custodial roles of currency, and will appeal to various stakeholders: consumers, merchants, banks, and the regulators.



The Company has a Payment Facilitator License. The license is necessary for us to facilitate card payments for our clients to process Visa , MasterCard, AmEx, and Discover Card purchases.



Competition



Although we believe there is currently no other company in the payment facilitator industry using, as we are, blockchain infrastructure, notable companies in the payment facilitator industry include PayPal, Stripe, and Square.
Customers



We currently process transactions for approximately 4,000 customers in over twenty-five (25) industries, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange (FX), retail, and e-commerce sectors. We do not rely on any one customer for more than 5% of our processing volume or revenue.
Employees and Human Capital



We currently have approximately 50 full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.

Recent Developments



Issuance of Note and Entry into Waiver



As previously disclosed, we sold and issued, in a registered direct offering, an 8% senior convertible note due November 3, 2023 in the aggregate original principal amount of $100 million (the "Note”). The Note had an original issue discount of sixteen percent (16%) resulting in gross proceeds to us of $84 million. The Note was sold pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated November 2, 2021 (the “SPA”), between us and the investor in the Note (the "Investor”).



The Note was issued on November 8, 2021, pursuant to an indenture dated November 2, 2021 between us and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture thereto, dated November 2, 2021, relating to the Notes (the "First Supplemental Indenture” and, the Base Indenture as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the “First Indenture”). The terms of the Note include those provided in the First Indenture and those made part of the First Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act.



Ranking



The Note is the senior unsecured obligations of the Company and not the financial obligations of our subsidiaries. Until such date as the principal amount of the Note is $5 million or less, all payments due under the Note will be senior to all other indebtedness of the Company and/or any of our subsidiaries.
Maturity Date



Unless earlier converted, or redeemed, the Note will mature on November 5, 2023, the second anniversary of their issuance date, which we refer to herein as the “Maturity Date”, subject to the right of the investors to extend the date:

If we elect to redeem all or any portion of a Note prior to the Maturity Date, all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed will also be payable. The interest rate of the Note will automatically increase to 15% per annum upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default (See “-- Events of Default” below).
Late Charges



We are required to pay a late charge of 15% on any amount of principal or other amounts that are not paid when due.

On January 28, 2022, we and the Investor, entered into an Agreement and Waiver (the “Waiver”) with regard to the Note that has the following major provisions:



(a) the Investor agreed to extend the “90 Day Eligibility Date” from February 3, 2022 to May 2, 2022 such that the Investor can no longer, if the closing price of the stock is less than $5.50, convert up to $30 million of the Note into shares of the Company’s common stock (with the conversion price being the lower of (i) the then in effect conversion price and (ii) the greater of (x) the Note’s $1.67 floor price or (y) 98% of the market price on the conversion date) (the “Alternate Optional Conversion Price”) prior to May 2, 2022;



(b) allows us to acquire, for cancellation, $6 million in in aggregate principal amount of the Note for a purchase price of $6.9 million such that the new principal amount of the Note is $94 million;



(c) lowers the initial fixed conversion price of the Note from $15 to $12; and



(d) if the trading volume of our common stock on any individual trading day is over $5 million (the “Alternate Conversion Company Waiver Measuring Date”), allows the Investor an opportunity to convert up to $5 million of the Note into shares of our common stock from the Alternate Conversion Company Waiver Measuring Date through and including 7:00 PM ET on the immediately following trading day. The conversion price would be the lower of (i) the then in effect conversion price and (ii) the greater of (x) the Note’s $1.67 floor price or (y) 98% of the market price on the conversion date.



The Company paid the investor $6.9 million on January 31, 2022.



1-Year Alternate Optional Conversion

Alternate Event of Default Optional Conversion



If an event of default has occurred under the Note, each holder may alternatively elect to convert the Note (subject to an additional 15% redemption premium) at the “Alternate Event of Default Conversion Price” equal to the lesser of:

● | the fixed conversion price then in effect; and
--+-----------------------------------------------




the greater of:




● | the floor price; and
--+---------------------


● | 80% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our common stock during the five trading days immediately prior to such conversion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beneficial Ownership Limitation



The Note may not be converted and shares of common stock may not be issued under the Note if, after giving effect to the conversion or issuance, the applicable holder of the Note (together with its affiliates, if any) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which we refer to herein as the “Note Blocker”. The Note Blocker may be raised or lowered to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% at the option of the applicable holder of Notes, except that any raise will only be effective upon 61-days’ prior notice to us.
Clarification to First Quarter Adjustment to Fixed Conversion Price



The Company wishes to clarify the possible first quarter adjustment to the Note’s initial fixed conversion price (which was originally $15 and is now, pursuant to the Waiver, $12).

If, during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022, we (i) fail to process at least $750 million in transaction volume or (ii) have revenue that is less than $12 million, and, if the Note’s fixed conversion price then in effect is greater than the greater of (x) the Note’s $1.67 floor price floor and (y) 140% of the market price as of April 1, 2022 (the “Adjustment Measuring Price”) then, on April 1, 2022, the fixed conversion price will automatically adjust to the Adjustment Measuring Price.



Change of Control Redemption Right



In connection with a change of control of the Company, each holder may require us to redeem in cash all, or any portion, of the Notes at a 15% redemption premium to the greater of the face value, the equity value of our common stock underlying the Notes and the equity value of the change of control consideration payable to the holder of our common stock underlying the Notes.



The equity value of our common stock underlying the Notes is calculated using the greatest closing sale price of our common stock during the period immediately preceding the consummation or the public announcement of the change of control and ending the date the holder gives notice of such redemption.



The equity value of the change of control consideration payable to the holder of our common stock underlying the Notes is calculated using the aggregate cash consideration per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders of our common stock upon the change of control.



Events of Default



Under the terms of the first supplemental indenture, the events of default contained in the base indenture shall not apply to the Notes. Rather, the Notes contain standard and customary events of default including but not limited: (i) the suspension from trading or the failure to list our common stock within certain time periods; (ii) failure to make payments when due under the Notes; and (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company.



If an event of default occurs, each holder may require us to redeem all or any portion of the Notes (including all accrued and unpaid interest and late charges thereon), in cash, at a 15% redemption premium to the greater of the face value and the equity value of our common stock underlying the Notes



The equity value of our common stock underlying the Notes is calculated using the greatest closing sale price of our common stock on any trading day immediately preceding such event of default and the date we make the entire payment required.



Company Optional Redemption Rights



At any time no event of default exits, we may redeem all, but not less than all, the Notes outstanding in cash all, or any portion, of the Notes at a 5% redemption premium to the greater of the face value and the equity value of our common stock underlying the Notes



The equity value of our common stock underlying the Notes is calculated using the greatest closing sale price of our common stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such date we notify the applicable holder of such redemption election and the date we make the entire payment required.
