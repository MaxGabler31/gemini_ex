ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
General
Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ("SHUSA" or the "Company") is the parent company of Santander Bank, National Association, (the "Bank" or "SBNA"), a national banking association, and owns a majority interest (approximately 69.9% as of February 21, 2019) of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "SC"), a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Santander, S.A. ("Santander"). SHUSA is also the parent company of Santander BanCorp (together with its subsidiaries, “Santander BanCorp”), a holding company headquartered in Puerto Rico which offers a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Banco Santander Puerto Rico; Santander Securities, LLC (“SSLLC”), a broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; Banco Santander International (“BSI”), an Edge Act corporation located in Miami which offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; Santander Investment Securities Inc. (“SIS”), a registered broker-dealer located in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries.

The Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had 627 branches and 2,274 automated teller machines ("ATMs") across its footprint. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI"). The Bank's principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.
SC's primary business is the indirect origination of retail installment contracts ("RICs"), principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. SC also offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to Chrysler customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand, the trade name used in providing services ("Chrysler Capital") under the ten-year private label financing agreement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC ("FCA"), formerly Chrysler Group LLC, signed by SC in 2013 (the "Chrysler Agreement"). These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has several relationships through which it provides other consumer finance products. 
Since its initial public offering (the “IPO”), SC has been consolidated with the Company and Santander for financial reporting and accounting purposes. If the Company directly, and Santander indirectly, owned 80% or more of SC’s common shares (“SC Common Stock”), SC could be consolidated with the Company and Santander for tax filing and capital planning purposes as well. Among other things, tax consolidation would (1) facilitate certain offsets of SC’s taxable income, (2) eliminate the double taxation of dividends from SC, and (3) trigger a release into SHUSA’s income the non-goodwill portion of the deferred tax liability established with respect to its ownership of SC. In addition, SHUSA and Santander would recognize a larger percentage of SC's net income. SC Common Stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the trading symbol "SC". 
SC's Relationship with FCA
Since May 2013, SC entered into the Chrysler Agreement, pursuant to which SC became the preferred provider for FCA’s consumer loans and leases and dealer loans. Business generated under terms of the Chrysler Agreement is branded as Chrysler Capital. During 2018, SC originated more than $7.9 billion of Chrysler Capital retail installment contracts ("RICs") and more than $9.7 billion of Chrysler Capital vehicle leases.
The Chrysler Agreement requires, among other things, that SC bears the risk of loss on loans originated pursuant to the agreement, but also that FCA shares in any residual gains and losses from consumer leases. The agreement also requires that SC maintains at least $5.0 billion in funding available for dealer inventory financing and $4.5 billion of financing dedicated to FCA retail financing. In turn, FCA must provide designated minimum threshold percentages of its subvention business to SC.

The Chrysler Agreement has a ten-year term, subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including the failure by either party to comply with certain of their ongoing obligations. These obligations include, for SC, meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years and, for FCA, treating SC in a manner consistent with comparable original equipment manufacturers' ("OEMs`") treatment of their captive providers, primarily regarding sales support. In addition, FCA may also terminate the agreement if, among other circumstances, (i) a person other than Santander or its affiliates or its other stockholders owns 20% or more of its common stock and Santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person, (ii) SC becomes, controls, or becomes controlled by, an OEM that competes with Chrysler, or (iii) certain of SC's credit facilities become impaired.
In connection with entering into the Chrysler Agreement, SC paid FCA a $150 million upfront, nonrefundable fee on May 1, 2013. This fee is considered payment for future profits generated from the Chrysler Agreement. Accordingly, the Company amortizes the Chrysler Agreement over the expected ten-year term as a component of net finance and other interest income. SC has also executed an equity option agreement with FCA, whereby FCA may elect to purchase, at any time during the term of the Chrysler Agreement, at fair market value, an equity participation of any percentage in the Chrysler Capital portion of SC's business.
For a period of 20 business days after FCA's delivery to SC of a notice of intent to exercise its option, SC is to discuss with FCA, in good faith, the structure and valuation of the proposed equity participation. If the parties are unable to agree on a structure and FCA still intends to exercise its option, SC will be required to create a new company into which the Chrysler Capital assets will be transferred and which will own and operate the Chrysler Capital business. If FCA and SC cannot agree on a fair market value during the 20-day negotiation period, each party will engage an investment bank and the appointed banks will mutually appoint a third independent investment bank to determine the value, with the cost of the valuation divided evenly between FCA and SC. Each party has the right to a one-time deferral of the independent valuation process for up to nine months. FCA will have a period of 90 days after a valuation has been determined, either by negotiation between the parties or by an investment bank, to deliver a binding notice of exercise. Following this notice, FCA's purchase is to be paid and settled within 10 business days, subject to a delay of up to 180 days if necessary to obtain any required consents from governmental authorities.
Any new company formed to effect FCA's exercise of its equity option will be a Delaware limited liability company unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. As long as each party owns at least 20% of the business, FCA and SC will have equal voting and governance rights without regard to ownership percentage. If either party has an ownership interest in the business of less than 20%, the party with less than 20% ownership will have the right to designate a number of directors proportionate to its ownership and will have other customary minority voting rights.
Because the equity option is exercisable at fair market value, SC could recognize a gain or loss upon exercise if the fair market value is determined to be different from book value. The Company believes that the fair market value of its Chrysler Capital financing business currently exceeds book value and therefore has not recorded a contingent liability for potential loss upon FCA's exercise.
Subsequent to the exercise of the equity option, SC's rights under the Chrysler Agreement would be assigned to the jointly-owned business. Exercise of the equity option would be considered a triggering event requiring re-evaluation of whether or not the remaining unamortized balance of the upfront fee SC paid to FCA on May 1, 2013 should be impaired.
In June 2018, SC announced that it was in exploratory discussions with FCA regarding the future of FCA's U.S. finance operations. FCA has announced its intention to establish a captive U.S. auto finance unit and indicated that acquiring Chrysler Capital is one option it would consider. In July 2018, FCA and the Company entered into a tolling agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to preserve their respective rights, claims and defenses under the Chrysler Agreement as they existed on April 30, 2018 and to refrain from delivering a written notice to the other party in accordance with the Chrysler Agreement until December 31, 2018.
FCA has not delivered a notice to exercise its equity option, and the Company remains committed to the success of the Chrysler Capital business. Although the likelihood, timing and structure of any such transaction, and the likelihood that the Chrysler Agreement will terminate, cannot be reasonably determined, termination of the Chrysler Agreement, or a significant change in the business relationship between SC and FCA, could materially adversely affect SC's and SHUSA's operations, including the origination of receivables through the Chrysler Capital portion of SC's business and the servicing of Chrysler Capital receivables. Moreover, there can be no assurance that SC could successfully or timely implement any such transaction without significant disruption of its operations or restructuring, or without incurring additional liabilities, which could involve significant expense to the Company and have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Intermediate Holding Company ("IHC")
On July 1, 2016, due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander became subject to both of the provisions of the FBO Final Rule discussed below under the "Regulatory Matters" section of Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the "MD&A"), of this Form 10-K. As a result of this rule, ownership of several Santander subsidiaries, including Santander BanCorp, BSI, SIS and SSLLC, were transferred to the Company, which became a U.S. intermediate holding company (an "IHC"). On July 1, 2017, an additional Santander subsidiary, Santander Financial Services, Inc. (“SFS”), a finance company located in Puerto Rico, was transferred to SHUSA, and on July 2, 2018, another Santander subsidiary, Santander Asset Management, LLC ("SAM"), an investment adviser located in Puerto Rico, was transferred to SHUSA. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
Segments
The Company's reportable segments are focused principally around the customers the Company serves. In 2018, the Company has identified the following reportable segments: 
Consumer and Business Banking
The Consumer and Business Banking segment includes the products and services provided to Bank customers, including consumer deposits, business banking, residential mortgage, unsecured lending and investment services. This segment offers a wide range of products and services to consumers and business banking customers, including demand and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts, certificates of deposit ("CDs") and retirement savings products. It also offers lending products such as credit cards, home equity loans and lines of credit, and business loans such as business lines of credit and commercial cards. In addition, the Bank provides investment services to its retail customers, including annuities, mutual funds, and insurance products. Santander Universities, which provides grants and scholarships to universities and colleges as a way to foster education through research, innovation and entrepreneurship, is the last component of this segment.
Commercial Banking
The Commercial Banking segment provides commercial lines, loans, letters of credit, receivables financing and deposits to medium and large commercial customers as well as financing and deposits for government entities, commercial loans to dealers and financing for equipment and commercial vehicles. This segment also provides financing and deposits for government entities and niche product financing for specific industries, including oil and gas, among others. Commercial Banking also includes Commercial Real Estate, which offers commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans to customers.
Corporate and Investment Banking ("CIB")
The CIB segment serves the needs of global commercial and institutional customers by leveraging the international footprint of Santander to provide financing and banking services to corporations with over $500 million in annual revenues. CIB's offerings and strategy are based on Santander's local and global capabilities in wholesale banking.
SC
SC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC’s primary business is the indirect origination of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. In conjunction with a ten-year private label financing agreement with FCA that became effective May 1, 2013, SC offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile, recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. In the third quarter of 2015, SC announced that it would exit personal lending, and such assets were accordingly classified as held-for-sale. 
SC continues to hold the Bluestem portfolio, which had a carrying balance of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, and remains a party to agreements with Bluestem that includes obligations, among other things, to purchase new advances originated by Bluestem and existing balances on accounts with new advances, for an initial term ending in April 2020 and renewable through April 2022 at Bluestem’s option. Although a third party is being sought to assume this obligation, SC may not be successful in finding such a party, and Bluestem may not agree to the substitution. The Bluestem portfolio continues to be classified as held-for-sale. Significant lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments have been recorded on this portfolio and may continue as long as SC holds the portfolio, particularly due to the purchase commitments.
6

SC has entered into a number of intercompany agreements with the Bank. All intercompany revenue and fees between the Bank and SC are eliminated in the consolidated results of the Company.
The financial results for each of these reportable segments are included in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are discussed in Item 7, "Line of Business Results" within the MD&A section of this Form 10-K. These results have been presented based on the Company's management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Company and, as a result, the financial results of the Company's reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions.
Other
The Other category includes certain immaterial subsidiaries such as BSI, Banco Santander Puerto Rico, SIS, SSLLC, and SFS, the unallocated interest expense on the Company's borrowings and other debt obligations and certain unallocated corporate income and indirect expenses.
Subsidiaries
SHUSA has two principal consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries at December 31, 2018, the Bank and SC. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 16,700 employees among its subsidiaries. No Company employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
Competition
The Bank is subject to substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in lending funds. The primary factors in competing for deposits include the ability to offer attractive rates, the convenience of office locations, the availability of alternate channels of distribution, and servicing capabilities. Direct competition for deposits comes primarily from other national, regional, and state banks, thrift institutions, and broker-dealers. Competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds, corporate and government securities, and credit unions. The primary factors driving competition for commercial and consumer loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, service levels and the range of products and services offered. Competition for originating loans normally comes from thrift institutions, national and state banks, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, finance companies, and insurance companies.
The Company also provides investment management, broker-dealer and private banking services for its clients. We face competition in providing these services from trust companies, full-service banks, asset managers, investment advisors, securities dealers, mutual fund companies, and other financial institutions. 
SC is also subject to substantial competition, particularly in the automobile finance industry. SC competes on the pricing it offers on its loans and leases as well as the customer service SC provides automobile dealer customers. SC, along with its competitors, provides pricing and other terms and conditions for loans and leases through web-based credit application aggregation platforms. When dealers submit applications for consumers acquiring vehicles, they can compare SC's terms and conditions against its competitors’ pricing. Dealer relationships are important in the automotive finance industry. Vehicle finance providers tailor product offerings to meet dealers' needs. SC's primary competitors in the vehicle finance space are national and regional banks, credit unions, independent financial institutions, and the affiliated finance companies of automotive manufacturers. 
Supervision and Regulation
SHUSA is a bank holding company (“BHC”) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As a BHC, the Company is subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve. SBNA is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured national bank chartered under the National Bank Act and subject to supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") has oversight over SHUSA, SBNA, and SHUSA’s other non-bank affiliates, including SC, for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. 
Refer to the "Regulatory Matters" section within Item 7- MD&A for discussion of current regulatory matters impacting the Company.

BHC Activity and Acquisition Restrictions
Federal laws restrict the types of activities in which BHCs may engage, and subject them to a range of supervisory requirements, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and policies. BHCs may engage in the business of banking and managing and controlling banks, as well as closely-related activities.
The Company would be required to obtain approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") if the Company were to acquire shares of any depository institution or any holding company of a depository institution, or any financial entity that is not a depository institution, such as a lending company.
Control of the Company or the Bank
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring SHUSA's common stock may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control the Company and thereby the Bank. Ownership of more than 10% of SHUSA’s capital stock may be deemed to constitute “control” if certain other control factors are present. If deemed to control the Company, those persons or groups would be required to obtain the Federal Reserve's approval to acquire the Company’s common stock and could be subject to certain ongoing reporting procedures and restrictions under federal law and regulations. 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The federal banking agencies adopted certain operational and managerial standards for depository institutions, including internal audit system components, loan documentation requirements, asset growth parameters, information technology and data security practices, and compensation standards for officers, directors and employees. 
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC 
The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against banking institutions and may terminate an institution’s deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
The FDIC charges financial institutions deposit premium assessments to ensure it has reserves to cover deposits that are under FDIC-insured limits, which is currently $250,000 per depositor per ownership category for each ownership deposit account category. 
FDIC insurance premium expenses were $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In addition to deposit insurance premiums, all insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. In 2018, the Bank paid Financing Corporation assessments of $2.5 million, compared to $4.0 million in 2017. The annual rate for all insured institutions dropped to $0.014 for every $1,000 in domestic deposits in 2018, compared to $0.046 in 2017. The assessments are revised quarterly and continue until the bonds mature between 2017 and 2019.
In March 2016, the FDIC finalized the rule to implement Section 334 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA") to provide for a surcharge assessment at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points on banks with over $10 billion in assets to increase the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC commenced this surcharge in the third quarter of 2016, which the FDIC estimated would take approximately two years. Under the rule, if the reserve ratio did not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC would impose a shortfall assessment on larger depository institutions, including SBNA. The FDIC announced on November 28, 2018 that the reserve ratio had reached 1.35%, which ended the surcharge period.
Restrictions on Subsidiary Banking Institution Capital Distributions
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (the “FDIA"), insured depository institutions must be classified in one of five defined tiers (well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized). Under OCC regulations, an institution is considered “well-capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as “well capitalized.”
8

If capital levels fall to significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the FDIA and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions and repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the institution’s capital account. 
Federal banking laws, regulations and policies limit the Bank’s ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank’s total distributions to the Company within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years; (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. In addition, the OCC's prior approval is required if the OCC deems it to be in troubled condition or a problem institution. 
Any dividends declared and paid have the effect of reducing the Bank’s Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets and risk-based capital ratios. The Company paid cash dividends on common stock of $410.0 million in 2018 while $10.0 million in dividends were declared or paid in 2017. The Company returned capital of $12.6 million in 2017, while no capital was returned in 2018.
Federal Reserve Regulation
Under Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is required to maintain a reserve against its transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts). Because reserves must generally be maintained in cash or in low-interest-bearing accounts, the effect of the reserve requirements is to reduce an institution’s asset yields.
The amount of total reserve requirements at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $429.0 million and $294.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company complied with these reserve requirements. 
Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") System
The FHLB system was created in 1932 and consists of 11 regional FHLBs. FHLBs are federally-chartered but privately owned institutions created by Congress. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is an agency of the federal government that is charged with overseeing the FHLBs. Each FHLB is owned by its member institutions. The primary purpose of the FHLBs is to provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development lending. FHLBs are generally able to make advances to their member institutions at interest rates that are lower than could otherwise be obtained by such institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to make minimum investments in FHLB stock based on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. The Bank is a member of and held investments in the FHLB of Pittsburgh which totaled $230.1 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $116.1 million at December 31, 2017. The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB to fund balance sheet growth, provide liquidity and for asset and liability management purposes. The Bank had access to advances with the FHLB of up to $17.7 billion at December 31, 2018, and had outstanding advances of $4.85 billion or 27% of total availability at that date. The level of borrowing capacity the Bank has with the FHLB of Pittsburgh is contingent upon the level of qualified collateral the Bank holds at a given time.
The Bank received $6.6 million and $12.9 million in dividends on its stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act
Several federal laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, and the USA Patriot Act require all financial institutions to, among other things, implement policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the U.S., imposed compliance and due diligence obligations, created criminal penalties, compelled the production of documents located both inside and outside the U.S., including those of non-U.S. institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the U.S., and clarified the safe harbor from civil liability to clients. The U.S. Treasury has issued a number of regulations that further clarify the USA Patriot Act’s requirements and provide more specific guidance on their application.

Financial Privacy
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLBA"), financial institutions are required to disclose to their retail customers their policies and practices with respect to sharing nonpublic customer information with their affiliates and non-affiliates, how they maintain customer confidentiality, and how they secure customer information. Customers are required under the GLBA to be provided with the opportunity to “opt out” of information sharing with non-affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. 
Environmental Laws
Environmentally-related hazards are a source of high risk and potentially significant liability for financial institutions related to their loans. Environmentally contaminated properties owned by an institution’s borrowers may result in a drastic reduction in the value of the collateral securing the institution’s loans to such borrowers, high environmental cleanup costs to the borrower affecting its ability to repay its loans, the subordination of any lien in favor of the institution to a state or federal lien securing clean-up costs, and liability to the institution for cleanup costs if it forecloses on the contaminated property or becomes involved in the management of the borrower. To minimize this risk, the Bank may require an environmental examination of, and reports with respect to, the property of any borrower or prospective borrower if circumstances affecting the property indicate a potential for contamination, taking into consideration the potential loss to the institution in relation to the burdens to the borrower. Such examination must be performed by an engineering firm experienced in environmental risk studies and acceptable to the institution, and the costs of such examinations and reports are the responsibility of the borrower. These costs may be substantial and may deter a prospective borrower from entering into a loan transaction with the Bank. The Company is not aware of any borrower which is currently subject to any environmental investigation or clean-up proceeding or any other environmental matter that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of SHUSA or its subsidiaries.
Securities Regulation
The Company conducts its securities activities through its subsidiaries SIS and SSLLC. SIS and SSLLC are registered broker-dealers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). SIS’s activities include investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed income securities. SIS, SSLLC and SAM are also registered investment advisers with the SEC, and BSI conducts certain securities transactions exempt from SEC registration on behalf of its clients.
