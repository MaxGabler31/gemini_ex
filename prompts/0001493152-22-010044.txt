Our Strategies
 
We are focused on achieving long-term growth in revenues, cash flow and profit. We believe that we can achieve this by developing multiple distribution channels and strengthening our marketing and promotions, leading to better product turnover and revenue. We also expect to broaden our product range as well as product differentiation in the future. Based on the business experience accumulated over the years, we believe we can improve the efficiency of our supply chain with time-saving and cost-saving supply chain management and marketing planning for the target customer base with our one-stop service.
 
Our primary aims are (i) to strengthen our product salability; (ii) to cut logistics cost and time spent and (iii) to further expand the market share in China. Toward this end, we plan to pursue the following business strategies:
 

● | Collaborate with third-party e-commerce platforms to boost product exposure, e.g. Tmall, Jingdong mall 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Deliver healthcare knowledge and consultation service via social media and We-media 
● | Build brand image and reputation through customer experience and word of mouth 
● | Increase the number of downstream distributors and wholesalers 
● | Strengthen the relationship with manufacturers, suppliers, drug agents and distributors 
● | Pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships 

 
We intend to develop both online and offline distribution channels to increase sales volume and revenue. We expect to partner with third party e-commerce platforms, social media and We-media such as Wechat, TikTok and Xiaohongshu to build our online presence. We believe that online channels will allow us to provide real-time nutrition and healthcare consultation services as well as increase customer engagement and retention. Starting from the second half of 2020, we have launched our “nutrition consulting” support services using a major social media software to allow customer groups to receive pre-purchase consultation and after-sales service for products anytime and anywhere.
 
Our current offline sales channel relies on distributors and sales agents. To enhance the visibility and marketability of our products and services and to improve brand recognition and awareness, we hope to develop store-in-shop and counter experiences. We also intend to partner with high-end gyms to form nutrition clubs and hold weight-loss training camps, health assessment and fitness training camps and other activities.
 
We intend to create a ‘one-stop’ solution for our customers by creating a multi-channel health product supply and retail system. We not only provide personalized consultation service to our customers, but also summarize and analyze our customer feedback and experiences through our consultation service and after-sales service. We intend to share this data with our manufacturers and supply chain partners to develop products and services that better meet the demands of our customers. By pooling and addressing the needs of downstream businesses and combining it with the Consumer to Manufacturer model for upstream transformation, we anticipate establishing a close relationship between manufacturers and suppliers. We believe this model can also reduce circulation costs and improve the efficiency of our supply chain.
