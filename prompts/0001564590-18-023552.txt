Business Developments
 
On Monday, October 16, 2017, we effectuated a reverse stock split of our shares of Common Stock whereby every five (5) pre-split shares of Common Stock were exchanged for one (1) post-split share of our Common Stock (“Reverse Stock Split”). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of the Common Stock received a cash payment in lieu thereof. Numbers presented in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
 
Effective December 22, 2017, we changed our state of incorporation from Washington to Delaware. As of that date, the rights of the Company's stockholders began to be governed by the Delaware corporation laws, our Certificate of Incorporation filed with the state of Delaware, and newly adopted By-Laws.
 
On July 3, 2018, we filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC for a maximum offering amount of $30 million. The shelf registration was subsequently deemed effective by the SEC on August 20, 2018.
 
On September 11, 2018, we received notification from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) that our application for additional funding for Astrogenetix was declined.
 
Our Business Units
 
Astro Scientific
 
Astro Scientific is a technology incubator that commercializes innovative technologies. Subsidiaries 1st Detect and Astrogenetix currently reside in Astro Scientific:
 
1st Detect - 1st Detect is a manufacturer of advanced chemical detection technology that detects and identifies trace amounts of explosives and narcotics. The Company offers technology that we believe outperforms currently deployed competitive trace detection solutions by offering:

• | A higher probability of detection with a near-zero false alarm rate
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A considerably expanded library of explosives, narcotics, and other compounds of interest
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A target library that can be instantaneously updated or expanded in the field without requiring hardware configuration changes
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved throughput at security or inspection checkpoints
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive pricing to current solutions
--+-----------------------------------------

 
Our efforts have resulted in a platform technology that has many diverse market opportunities, with the initial focus remaining on the explosives and narcotics trace detection market where ion mobility spectrometers (“IMS”) are the leading incumbent technology. Of the 25,000 IMS instruments installed in the field, many are nearing their end of life. We believe

these IMS systems have many shortcomings — most notably their limited library of detectable compounds, inability to adapt quickly to emerging threats, limited probability of detection, and significant false positive rates that reduce the user’s confidence in the machine’s efficacy and extends security or inspection checkpoint wait times.
 
As the current generation of IMS technology is replaced, we are positioning the Company to be the best next-generation solution for this market. Following a successful demo of our technology to U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) personnel in late 2017, we recently announced that the TRACER 1000 entered the Developmental Testing and Evaluation (“DT&E”) process at the DHS’s Transportation Security Laboratory (“TSL”). Successful completion and passing of the DT&E phase would lead to TSL Certification. TSL Certification is a significant endorsement that foreign governments and other U.S. government agencies consider when procuring explosives trace detector (“ETD”) instrumentation. Certification is also a major step towards being listed on the TSA’s Qualified Products List (“QPL”), and subsequently being deployed in airports throughout the U.S. In addition, we also recently announced that the TRACER 1000 has been accepted into the TSA’s Air Cargo Screening Technology Qualification Test (“ACSQT”) program, representing a major step toward inclusion on TSA’s exclusive Air Cargo Screening Technology List (“ACSTL”) and having the TRACER 1000 deployed at airports and cargo facilities worldwide to screen checked luggage and other air cargo. The instrument is designed to enable air carriers, freight forwarders, shippers, and independent cargo facilities to stay ahead of evolving threats while optimizing cargo throughput. Finally, the Company also announced that the TRACER 1000 was accepted into the European Civil Aviation Conference’s (“ECAC”) evaluation process for both passenger and cargo screening in airports. ECAC is the European equivalent to the U.S. TSA. The ECAC Certification would be a significant milestone that will allow us to begin selling to airports and governments internationally.
 
There is no assurance that any of the further steps detailed in the milestones mentioned above will be achieved or that our technology will be approved by any of the programs listed.
 
Astrogenetix - Astrogenetix was developing a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the International Space Station to develop vaccines. We were working with Texas A&M University to obtain additional funding from NASA, which was declined subsequent to year-end. Future efforts at Astrogenetix have therefore been halted due to the lack of funding.
Astral Images Corporation
 
Astral Images - Astral is a developer of advanced film restoration and enhancement software. The Company offers significant cost savings to content owners who traditionally employ a laborious, inconsistent, and expensive manual frame-by-frame restoration process. At 24 frames-per-second, a full-length movie can easily have in excess of 200,000 frames, making manual conversion prohibitively expensive in some instances. At some point, we believe film studios will need to convert their film assets to 4K and/or high-dynamic range (“HDR”) (collectively known as ultra-high definition (“UHD”)). Astral will continue to position itself to support this shift using its powerful artificial intelligence (“AI”)-driven algorithms that remove dust, scratches, and defects from film while converting the content to a digital format with significantly enhanced resolution. 
 
The Company is at a point whereby its resources must be carefully allocated to optimize the primary objective – setting 1st Detect on a path to meaningful sales by getting through testing and certification. Although we believe Astral has developed valuable technology fortified by patents and trade secrets, the potential market has not evolved as quickly as anticipated. Due to funding constraints, the Company’s main focus remains on the 1st Detect opportunity. Consequently, headcount at Astral has been reduced, the Astral office was consolidated with the corporate office, expenditures have been reduced, and new development is exclusively focused on strategic initiatives that would facilitate the realization of Astral’s value.
 
Business Strategy

There are approximately 25,000 IMS instruments deployed today, with many nearing their end of life. As the current generation of IMS technology is replaced, we are positioning the Company to be the best next-generation solution for this market.  We have launched the TRACER 1000, the world’s first ETD driven by a mass spectrometer. With mass spectrometry being the gold standard of chemical detection, a mass spectrometry-based ETD can significantly improve detection capabilities, dramatically reduce the number of false positives, and allow for a much more expansive library of compounds of interest, yielding an instrument that we believe is far superior to the currently deployed IMS instruments, at a similar price point.
 
While most of our activities have been focused on delivering on explosives and narcotics detection for airports and cargo facilities, there is significant opportunity in other government agencies and in the industrial and commercial markets as well. Such markets are large and diverse, often requiring customized solutions to satisfy customer needs. Significant effort is therefore only reserved for customer-funded development programs or programs with large markets where our technology has a unique differentiator.
 
Astral Images
 
Astral provides the state-of-the-art software solution for image restoration and enhancement by deriving significant efficiencies through its powerful AI platform to an industry that traditionally relies on expensive manual labor for image correction and enhancement that can be inconsistent and fraught with errors and omissions. While the Company looks to optimize its resources by focusing primarily on 1st Detect, the Company remains intent on developing strategic partnerships, such as the recently announced agreement with ColorTime, a post-production house specializing in media content creation, restoration, and distribution. As part of this arrangement, ColorTime is incorporating Astral’s ICE™ software and scanner hardware into their workflow, for which Astral receives a percentage of the revenue generated by ColorTime. Future revenue generated as part of this agreement, however, is uncertain and dependent upon ColorTime’s sales efforts.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All of our ICE products provide for significant cost savings over the expensive, labor-intensive, and inconsistent manual process currently employed in the industry.
 
Customers, Sales, and Marketing
 
Astro Scientific
 
1st Detect
 
Marketing efforts at 1st Detect are currently focused on U.S. and foreign government agencies and commercial companies in aviation, cargo, and border security. 
 
Astral Images
 
Astral is positioned to leverage the demand generated for 4K/HDR content by the release of the new 4K/HDR standard and the growth in sales of next-generation 4K/HDR televisions. Consumers are increasingly demanding content that is optimized for their new televisions, but the conversion of content lags the sale of televisions capable of displaying that content, similar to what we saw with the proliferation of HDTV and 3D. In order to remain relevant in over-the-top distribution (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.), content owners will need to convert their content to conform to the new standards. Astral is positioned to facilitate this market when investment in content conversion to 4K/HDR accelerates by partnering with established post-production houses. In fact, the Company announced a partnership with ColorTime in July and will continue to explore similar relationships. 
Competition

Astral Images
 
Astral faces significant competition from several vendors in the scanning and restoration services industry. Our competitors are independent scanning boutiques at one end of the spectrum, and at the other end, fully-integrated post-production houses offering a breadth of services, including scanning and restoration, all of whom use the traditional manual restoration process that is laborious, non-exacting, inconsistent, and expensive. The level of automation provided by our AI algorithms gives us compelling cost advantages while maintaining the high image quality. Our solutions are scalable, cost effective, and more consistent when compared to competitors’ traditional manual approaches.
