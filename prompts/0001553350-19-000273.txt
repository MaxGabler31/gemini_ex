ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS.

Background

United Cannabis Corporation (we our, us, UCANN, or the Company) a Colorado corporation, was originally formed as a California corporation under the name MySkin, Inc. on November 15, 2007. MySkin was engaged in the business of providing management services to a medical spa in Los Angeles, California which provided various advanced skin care services until March 31, 2014, when this business was sold to the prior President of the Company.

In early 2014 we decided to exit the medical spa management business and change our focus to providing products, services and intellectual property to the cannabis industry.

On March 26, 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with Earnest Blackmon, Tony Verzura and Chad Ruby pursuant to which Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby licensed certain intellectual property to us in exchange for 38,690,000 shares of our common stock.

The intellectual property we licensed includes know-how relating to the design and buildout of cultivation facilities, growing/cultivation systems, seed-to-sale protocols and procedures, products, access to a genetic catalogue including over 150 different strains, an advanced (non-psychoactive) cannabinoid sequencing therapy program utilizing patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals called the A.C.T. Now Program (ACT Now or ACT Now Program), security, regulatory compliance, and other methods and processes which relate to the cannabis industry.

In May 2014 we changed our corporate domicile from California to Colorado and changed our name to United Cannabis Corporation.

United Cannabis Corporation is focused on extracting products from industrial hemp plants, which we wholesale to manufacturers, and which we use to create unique therapeutics for a wide range of diseases that can be utilized by patients globally. We own distinct intellectual property relating to the legalized growth, production, manufacture, marketing, management, utilization and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana and marijuana infused products. We license our intellectual property to businesses in the cannabis industry.

Patent

On August 15, 2017, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued to the Company US Patent #9730911 (the Patent) granting exclusive rights to its proprietary formulations based on compounds extracted from cannabis plant materials; more specifically the composition of matter pertaining to the use of phytocannabinoids, cannabinoids, and specific terpene profiles in liquid form. This composition of matter Patent provides protection for our proprietary formulations. The Patent protects the use of suspending both phytocannabinoids and cannabinoids with specific combinations of cannabis derived terpenes in liquid forms with an array of delivery methods including capsule, sublingual, topical, oral, suppository, and vaporization. Cannabinoids referenced in the application include ratios of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa), cannabidiolic acid (CBDa), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromenic acid (CBCa), and cannabichromene (CBC). At August 15, 2017, we classified the costs associated with research, legal fees, application costs incurred in the process of being granted the Patent on our consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $142,317, and we began amortizing such cost of the Patent on a straight-line basis over a 15-year period. Amortization expense of the Patent is $7,116 and $2,679 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and accumulated amortization is $9,795 and $2,679 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Industrial Hemp Extraction Program

In early 2018, we elected to focus a significant portion of our assets, human resources and financial capital on the manufacturing and selling of a variety of cannabidiol centric products derived from industrial hemp plants. We constructed a pilot industrial hemp extraction facility in Weldona, Colorado. We hired and trained specialized extraction personnel and laboratory technicians that enable us to convert components of industrial hemp flower to finished CBD products.

The Weldona extraction facility opened in April 2018, and during the 10 months that the Weldona extraction facility has been in operation, it has generated approximately $10,000,000 of revenues from the sale of the CBD finished goods produced at the facility. The revenue amount of $10,000,000 includes approximately $3,300,000 of revenue from CBD sales during the first two months of 2019. 

Based upon the positive financial results of the Weldona extraction facility and the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized the cultivation, sale and distribution of products derived from the hemp plant, we decided in late 2018 to greatly expand our 
industrial hemp extraction program in order to capitalize on the growing world-wide demand that we see for CBD extracted products. Our first step in this expansion program is the construction of our new industrial hemp extraction facility in Mead, Colorado. Upon completion in April 2019, the Mead facility will have a production capacity ten (10) times greater than our Weldona facility.

Our expansion program also includes operating industrial hemp extraction facilities that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States. These facilities will be a replica of our Mead facility, with the same production capacity. Our first undertaking in that regard is a joint venture we have formed to construct an industrial hemp extraction facility in South Carolina that is scheduled to begin construction between May and July of 2019. 

Our expansion program includes plans to open extraction facilities in California, Florida, Illinois, Tennessee New York, and in either Oregon or Washington to serve the pacific northwest. 

We are presently researching agricultural acreage and physical plant locations in Jamaica, where we plan to open an industrial hemp extraction facility, and where we plan to cultivate hundreds of acres of industrial hemp in conjunction with our 50% owned Jamaican subsidiary, Cannabinoid Research Development Company, Limited. If an extraction facility is built in Jamaica, it is our intent to export CBD products throughout the Caribbean and to export CBD products to Canada and Europe. It is our understanding that there is a strong demand for CBD products in the Caribbean, Canada and the European countries. 

In order to help provide a consistent supply of industrial hemp flower for our extraction facilities, we purchased farming equipment and leased hundreds of acres of farm land on which we grew a crop of industrial hemp. It is our intent to grow at least one crop of industrial hemp plants per calendar year and to harvest a sufficient amount of industrial hemp flower from our crop to supply our extraction facility on a vertically integrated basis. It is also our intent to partner with industrial hemp farmers and to purchase industrial hemp on the open market to supply raw material for our industrial hemp extraction facilities.

2018 Farm Bill Legalizing Hemp 

On December 12, 2018, Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which was signed into law by President Trump the following week. 

The bill includes the following important provisions:

·
 The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent by dry weight. This definition is consistent with the definition of “industrial hemp” in the 2014 bill, which created a limited agricultural pilot program regarding research into industrial hemp.

·
 The 2018 Farm Bill removes hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, paving the way for the wholly legal cultivation, possession, sale and distribution of the hemp plant.

·
 The 2018 Farm Bill delegates to states and Indian tribes the broad authority to regulate and limit the production and sale of hemp and hemp products within their borders. States and Indian tribes cannot, however, limit the transportation or shipment of hemp and hemp products through their respective jurisdictions.

The Brightfield Group, a Chicago, Illinois based predictive analytics and market research firm for the legal cannabis and CBD industry, estimates that the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will help expand the CBD market such that the market will reach $22 billion by 2022.

Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinal Products

One of our primary goals is to advance the use of phytocannabinoids therapeutics in medicine through research, product development and education. We are dedicated to improving the lives of patients. We provide the intellectual property, patented technology, trusted brands, clinical data, technical training, sales tools and methodologies necessary to assist our clients businesses for success. Our ACT Now Program utilizes our patented Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals with a HIPPAA compliant electronic health record (EHR) software that enables physicians to create comprehensive sequencing charts specific to their patients medical aliments. The ACT Now EHR software allows for global monitoring, patient management, and effective cannabinoid therapy protocols.

Our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinal products are designed to help supplement deficiencies related to the endocannabinoid system including pain, neuropathy, arthritis, MS, IBS, autism, seizures, eczema, sleep, anxiety, head trauma, opioid dependency and clinical endocannabinoid deficiencies. The endocannabinoid system is a signaling system within the human body that utilizes hundreds of receptors to help maintain homeostasis between the central nervous system and the immune system. 

Our Prana Aromatherapy Transdermal Roll-on line uses a proprietary blend of essential oils infused with cannabinoids designed to provide targeted and large surface relief with combinations of aromatherapy. The transdermal is a part of the complete patented Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals line, which is offered in 5 categories (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5), with three delivery methods (sublingual, capsules, topical). Dosages range from 1mg to 50mg, are available in both raw and activated formulations, and paired with specific cannabis derived terpene profiles. 

Prana Therapeutics, Inc

In furtherance of our long-term plan, on July 14, 2017, we acquired 95% of the voting interests of Prana Therapeutics, Inc. (Prana or PTI), in consideration for the issuance of 5,730,000 shares of our common stock. The acquisition of Prana broadens our foundation in plant-based drug development. Prana is a biotech company focused on developing targeted therapeutics for the prevention of the negative side effects of chemotherapy, management of rheumatoid arthritis and treatment of brain cancer. 

Similar to the use of the compounds found in the cannabis plant to create our Prana Bio Medicinal products, Prana identifies novel combinations of botanical compounds to address unmet medical needs. Pranas principal drug, Epidiferphane, is a leading example of how combinatorial targeting can be used to address complex and difficult-to-treat diseases.

On August 3, 2018, PTI received notice that its licensed flagship product, EDP, received approval on an Investigational New Drug application from the FDA for a clinical investigation for breast cancer. The clinical investigation will include a dose escalation, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy trial. The Phase 1 trial will test the potential toxicity of EDP at two targeted dosages and will measure safety levels, side effects, optimal dosage, and formulation. The Phase 2 trial will focus on whether or not EDP passes efficacy evaluations by reducing side effects of chemotherapy in patients. 

Prana was founded by Dr. Brent Reynolds, a professor of Medical Research in the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Florida, College of Medicine and Dr. Dennis Steindler, a professor at Tufts University as well as, Dr. Loic Deleyrolle, a research assistant at McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida. Pranas business model is based on technology developed there. Drs. Reynolds and Steindler have filed on behalf of the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. (University of Florida) patents related to the composition of matter and use claims on this technology in the United States and internationally. Prana owns the exclusive, world-wide license to the technology through a licensing agreement with the University of Florida. Both Drs. Reynolds and Deleyrolle continue as consultants to Prana, while also serving as professors and performing research at the University of Florida. Dr. Steindler does not have any ongoing affiliation with Prana, and Prana is operated as a stand-alone, majority owned subsidiary of the Company.

We purchased Prana based upon our belief in the potential of Epidiferphane to help with the negative side effects of chemotherapy, inflammation and brain tumors;

The Negative Side Effects of Chemotherapy

An estimated 650,000 patients undergo chemotherapy each year, in the US alone, at a cost of approximately $12 billion. There are several protocols to minimize the side effects associated with chemotherapy, there is currently no protocol that prevents these symptoms. Preclinical data have shown Epidiferphane to be effective in preventing Anemia (low red blood cells), Neutropenia (low white blood cells), attenuating Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy, and protecting the endogenous neural stem cell population that is associated with Chemofog (memory problems). At least one of these conditions are experienced by 90% of patients going through chemotherapy.
Inflammatory Disease

Approximately 150 million patients suffer from inflammation and pain associated with arthritis and back-centric conditions, spending in excess of $30 billion on treatments, many of which have significant side effects. Epidiferphane in combination with nutritional ketosis reduces levels of cytokines that contribute to inflammatory diseases and in a small cohort of patients has been reported to reduce pain, morning stiffness and improve sleep.
Brain Tumors

There are approximately 80,000 new brain cancer diagnoses in the US each year; Glioblastoma, the most common type, has a survival diagnosis of approximately 12 months. In pre-clinical rodent testing, Epidiferphane, in conjunction with a nutritional ketosis, has been shown to double the mean life expectancy, increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and sensitize chemotherapy resistant tumors to standard of care drugs.
Cannabinoid Research Development Company Limited (CRD)

In August 2014, we acquired 50% of the capital stock of CRD and we agreed to fund the operations of CRD on terms mutually agreed upon by us and CRD. As of the date of this annual report, CRD had ten employees and had applied to the Jamaican government for a license to conduct research on the benefits of cannabis which will be grown by CRD in Jamaica.

On March 16, 2018 Jamaicas University of the West Indies Ethics Committee approved our proposal to conduct clinical trials on our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals P1 Capsules for the treatment of chronic pain. The study was conducted in conjunction with CRD at the Centre For Cannabis Research at the University of West Indies, Mona Campus, in Jamaica. The clinical research study has been completed for enrollment, patient dosing, and blood analysis. Data is being analyzed by outside biostatisticians. A peer-reviewed publication is expected in 2019.

ACT Now Program

One of our primary goals is to advance the use of cannabinoids in medicine through research, product development and education. Our intellectual property includes our ACT Now Program which is a comprehensive full spectrum cannabinoid therapy guide that utilizes the entire cannabis plant by controlling specific cannabinoid ratios, accurate dosing and multiple non-invasive delivery methods. Our ACT Now Program offers a wide range of affordable patient driven programs with limitless combinations of cannabinoid-based products and nutritional recommendations to assist patients suffering from chronic pain, opiate dependency, inflammation, glaucoma, PTSD, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, Crohns, IBS, seizures, epilepsy, paralysis, autoimmune, autism, tumors, HIV/AIDS and many types of cancer.

We own certain proprietary formulations, processes and other intellectual property which can be used to produce our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals in connection with our ACT Now Program. These products, which are made with unique combinations of pharmaceutically active cannabinoids, provide a comprehensive solution designed to enable physicians and patients to design, implement and monitor effective therapy protocols. 

Competition

The recent growth in the industry has attracted many businesses trying to enter the market. Some of our competitors have greater capital resources and facilities which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. Due to this competition, there is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in generating revenues. Our inability to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.

Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice (DOJ)defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of March 28, 2019, 30 states and the District of Columbia allowed their citizens to use medical marijuana. Additionally, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. 

The previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In this regard, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following in preventing:

·
 the distribution of cannabis to minors;
 ·
 revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
 ·
 the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some for to other states;
 ·
 state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 ·
 violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
 ·
 drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
 ·
 the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
 ·
 cannabis possession or use on federal property.

On January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memo stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions, which require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately. 

It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement.

However, on March 31, 2018 President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget bill that includes a provision that prevents the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using funds to arrest or prosecute patients, caregivers and businesses that are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. This provision, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs.

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.
