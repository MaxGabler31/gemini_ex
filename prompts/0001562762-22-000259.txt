Item 1. Business
General

We are a leading nation-wide operator of retail tire and automotive repair stores in the United States. We offer to our customers, referred to as “guests”, replacement tires and tire related services, automotive undercar repair services, and a broad range of routine maintenance services, primarily on passenger cars, light trucks, and vans. We also provide other products and services for brakes; mufflers and exhaust systems; and steering, drive train, suspension, and wheel alignment. 

We believe the convenience and value we offer are key factors in serving and growing our base of customers. At March 26, 2022, we operated 1,304 retail tire and automotive repair stores and serviced approximately 5.2 million vehicles in fiscal 2022. 

Our retail tire and automotive repair stores operate primarily under the brands “Monro Auto Service and Tire Centers,” “Tire Choice Auto Service Centers,” “Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers,” “Car-X Tire & Auto,” “Tire Warehouse Tires for Less,” “Ken Towery’s Tire & Auto Care,” “Mountain View Tire & Auto Service,” “Tire Barn Warehouse,” and “Free Service Tire & Auto Centers.”

(a)Includes recently acquired stores to be converted to certain brands named above.

The typical format for a Monro store is a free-standing building consisting of a sales area, fully equipped service bays and a parts/tires storage area. Most service bays are equipped with above-ground electric vehicle lifts. Generally, each store is located within 25 miles of a “key” store which carries approximately double the inventory of a typical store and serves as a mini-distribution point for slower moving inventory for other stores in its area. Individual store sizes, number of bays, and stocking levels vary greatly and are dependent primarily on the availability of suitable store locations, population, demographics, and intensity of competition among other factors. 

A certain number of our retail locations also service commercial customers. Our locations that serve commercial customers generally operate consistently with our other retail locations, except that the sales mix for these locations includes a higher number of commercial tires.

As of March 26, 2022, Monro had seven wholesale locations and three retread facilities. The wholesale locations, in most cases, sell tires to customers for resale, although these tire sales do not include installation or other tire related services. The retread facilities re-manufacture tires through the replacement of tread on worn tires that are later sold to customers. Monro also had 79 Car-X franchised locations as of March 26, 2022. (During 2022, we acquired 11 and closed five franchised locations.)

Our operations are organized and managed in one operating segment. The internal management financial reporting that is the basis for evaluation to assess performance and allocate resources by our chief operating decision maker consists of consolidated data that includes the results of our retail, commercial, and wholesale locations. As such, our one operating segment reflects how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.

Monro incorporated in New York in 1959. We maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York.

Recent Developments

In May 2022, we entered into an agreement with American Tire Distributors, Inc. to sell our wholesale tire operations and internal tire distribution operations for approximately $105 million in the aggregate. Of the $105 million purchase price, $65 million is expected to be paid at the expected closing date during the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 25, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”) and the remaining $40 million is expected to be paid as earnout payments after the closing. The earnout payments will be earned, on a per-tire basis, based on tires we will buy from American Tire Distributors pursuant to a distribution agreement that we expect to enter with American Tire Distributors at the closing date of the sale of assets. 

We expect to enter into additional agreements with American Tire Distributors at or prior to the closing date, including (1) a distribution agreement, in which American Tire Distributors will agree to supply and sell tires to our retail locations; (2) a managed services agreement, in which American Tire Distributors will provide category management, ordering, dashboard, and inventory management services to us; and (3) an agreement relating to preferred data services to be provided to us by American Tire Distributors. 

Business Strategy

Our vision is to be America’s leading auto and tire service center, trusted by consumers as the best place in their neighborhoods for quality automotive service and tires. We believe that success in this vision will position Monro to deliver consistent and sustainable organic growth as well as lead to strong, long-term financial performance. Specifically, we are committed to seeing this vision executed across all aspects of the business, through the following actions:

•Exceed guest expectations. We will continue to invest in and execute strategic initiatives to improve our guests’ in-store experience. This included significant investment in technician headcount and compensation in 2022.

•Provide consistent value. We intend to be able to offer better value than new car dealers to more price-sensitive consumers. Vehicles generally need more service and repairs as they advance in age. However, as consumers’ vehicles age, the consumers’ willingness to pay higher prices decreases. Monro’s service menu is focused on items that are purchased frequently, like oil changes and other scheduled services, along with higher value services like tires, brakes, and other undercar services. Our tire pricing and category management system allows us to dynamically track demand trends and make rapid adjustments to optimize our tire assortment by leveraging the breadth of our tire brand portfolio to offer the right tires at what we believe are the right price points. 

•Build a committed, knowledgeable organization of friendly and professional teammates. We will continue to invest in technology and training to accelerate productivity and team engagement. This includes our data-driven cloud-based store staffing and scheduling software that re-balances our store technician labor to meet customer demand as well as utilizing Monro University, an extensive cloud-based learning curriculum, to provide our employees, referred to as “teammates,” with the technical training needed to effectively serve our customers today and into the future.

We are committed to building an omni-channel presence through our primary brand websites to create a seamless buying experience for our customers. With responsive optimized design for mobile users, a streamlined tire search and improved content and functionality, our brand websites better position us to address our customers’ needs. These websites, aligned with our primary brand names, help customers search for store locations, access coupons, make service appointments, shop for tires, and access information on our services and products, as well as car care tips. Importantly, they better showcase the solutions we provide to our customers, including our Good, Better, Best product and service packages.

Growth Strategy

Executing on accretive acquisition opportunities remains a key element of our growth strategy. We have a robust pipeline and believe the fragmentation of our industry allows for many opportunities for consolidation. Using consumer demographic analytics, we believe we can better identify targets that operate in the markets with favorable demographics and customer trends, allowing us to enter regions from which we are poised to benefit most. Additionally, to ensure we are capitalizing on these opportunities, we have added talent and an organizational structure to our mergers and acquisitions team, who work with our management team to ensure we capitalize on the momentum in the market. 

During the last five years, we have completed 17 acquisitions, adding 225 locations and approximately $314 million in annualized revenue. Additionally, during this time, we have entered five states, solidifying our presence in existing markets as well as expanding into the Western region. As of March 26, 2022, we have stores in 32 states.

BUSINESS


In addition to our plan to continue to seek suitable acquisitions, we plan to add new greenfield stores. Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operations.

Key factors in market and site selection for selecting new greenfield store locations include population, demographic characteristics, vehicle population, and the intensity of competition. We partner with a customer analytics firm to provide market segmentation and demographic data specific to a geographic area near a Monro location to identify high value lookalike customers and market directly to them. We attempt to cluster stores in market areas to achieve economies of scale in advertising, supervision, and distribution costs. All new greenfield sites presently under consideration are within our established market areas. 

Purchasing and Distribution

We believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy. We also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners allows us to ensure we are receiving competitive pricing and terms as well as minimize the margin impact of economic pressures such as tariffs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions.

Until we close the proposed transaction with American Tire Distributors, we select and purchase tires, parts, and supplies for all Company-operated stores on a centralized basis through an automatic replenishment system based on operational data we collect from stores daily. This allows us to control store inventory on a near real-time basis. Additionally, each store has access to the inventory carried by up to the 14 stores or distribution center nearest to it. Management believes that this feature improves customer satisfaction and store productivity by reducing the time required to locate out-of-stock parts and tires. It also improves profitability because it reduces the amount of inventory which must be purchased outside Monro from local vendors. Local vendor purchases are made when needed at the store level and accounted for approximately 24 percent of all parts and tires purchased in 2022.

Our ten largest vendors accounted for approximately 83 percent of our total stocking purchases, with the largest vendor accounting for approximately 25 percent of total stocking purchases in 2022. In 2022, Monro imported approximately 11 percent of our parts (excluding batteries, oil, and supplies) and tire purchases. We purchase parts, oil, and tires from approximately 100 vendors. Management believes that our relationships with vendors are excellent and that alternative sources of supply exist, at comparable cost, for substantially all parts used in our business. 

We enter into contracts with certain parts and tire suppliers, some of which require us to buy (at market competitive prices) up to 100 percent of our annual purchases of specific products. These agreements expire at various dates. We believe these agreements provide us with high quality, branded merchandise at preferred pricing, along with strong marketing and training support.

Most of our parts supply is distributed to our stores through our network of distribution centers, and vendors ship most of our tires supply directly to our stores. Stores are generally replenished at least monthly, and such replenishment fills, on average, 99 percent of all items ordered by the automatic replenishment system. Monro operates eleven distribution centers in California, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. 

Human Capital

At Monro, our business success is built upon our dedicated, passionate, and diverse teammates who work and live in the communities we serve. We are committed to providing a safe, healthy, inclusive, and supportive work environment where teammates embrace our core value of collaboration, feel empowered, and are motivated to have enriching and successful careers. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and retain top talent. To that end, we strive to provide an engaging work experience that excites and motivates our teammates to deliver their best every day as well as provides opportunities for learning and growth, to ensure our team is always the best in the business. 

As of March 26, 2022, Monro had approximately 8,750 employees, of whom 8,170 were employed in the field organization, 230 were employed at the distribution centers, 300 were employed at our corporate headquarters, referred to as store support center, and 50 were employed in other offices. Monro's employees are not members of any union. 

Teammate Retention

We believe that effective human capital management includes preventing situations of understaffing or excessive overtime, teammate burnout or poor work life balance. For this reason, through our continued investment in store staffing to allow for more available workers as well as an increase in scheduling flexibility, we aim to grow teammate satisfaction. 

In addition to enhancing the resources available to support our teammates, we have made improvements to our scheduling system which allows teammates to have longer visibility into their schedules and plan for occasions that require an absence.

BUSINESS



We also understand that our teammates will benefit from a clear path to advancement and from investments in their continuous learning to allow them to achieve their personal development needs and career growth. To that end, we invest in training and development programs at all levels within the Company. We also leverage annual processes that support individual performance planning, individual professional development planning, and conduct a broad review of talent throughout our organization. 

Our continuous efforts to build out our human capital strategy are reflected in our turnover rates in 2022 and 2021, each of which are lower than 2015 - 2020.

In recent years, we have expanded our online training program, Monro University, to be a comprehensive, company-wide training program not only focused on the technical and operational excellence training that technicians need to effectively serve our customers today and prepare them to handle future requirements, but also committed to developing leadership and excellence at all levels within our Company through a wide variety of topics accessible to our teammates in our stores, distribution centers, and store support center.

New technician development has been an area of particular focus for Monro to increase productivity and retention and make it easier for technicians to overcome barriers of joining the industry. One way we do this is by offering a tool purchase program through which trainee technicians can acquire their own set of tools. We also provide Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”) certification in eight different categories as technicians advance in their careers.

Store and operations managers also have courses available through Monro University that are supplemented with live and on-line vendor training courses. Management training covers topics including safety, customer service, human resources, leadership, and scheduling and is delivered on a regular basis. We believe that involving operations management in the development and delivery of these sessions results in more relevant and actionable training for store managers, helping improve staff retention as well as overall performance.

Monro University also provides targeted training for corporate management and staff, including diversity training, harassment training, and people manager training.

We also foster development through annual reviews at which time employees can discuss with their manager goals for aligning their own development with our business objectives.

Our teammates are compensated in a fair manner which increases along with productivity. Our store compensation plan also streamlines bonus programs, creating consistency and increasing human capital productivity across our stores.

In addition to providing ongoing learning and development opportunities, ensuring our teammates feel supported is also important in teammate retention. Besides standard employee benefits we offer a confidential Employee Assistance Program with 24/7 support, financial counseling, estate planning, and online resources for parents whose children struggle with developmental disabilities, as well as other services aimed at enhancing our teammates’ mental, emotional, and physical well-being. 

One of the ways we embrace our teammates’ well-being is through the administration of our own Teammate Assistance Fund, a third-party 501(c)(3) organization available for all our teammates. Launched in March 2022, the fund provides an opportunity for all teammates to take care of each other through tax-deductible payroll and other one-time contributions. Through donations from Monro and contributions from our teammates, Board members and others, the Teammate Assistance Fund provides timely financial assistance to teammates impacted by financially devastating circumstances beyond their control and their means.

Workplace Safety 

We are committed to providing a safe and secure work environment and have specific safety programs. To identify elevated safety-related risk areas more effectively, we have increased our focus on data gathering, tracking, and analysis. With greater insight into real-time data, we can prioritize focus on areas that present the biggest potential hazards to our teammates and identify process improvements. Another important component of our risk analysis is conducting formal and thorough investigations into safety-related incidents. Investigations are analyzed by our Vice President of Risk and Safety as well as our Risk Management Team to determine a root cause, and pro-active plans are in place to improve safety related patterns that emerge, determining the next steps to address these patterns. 

Monro’s training programs are key to our strong safety culture. Training increases awareness and helps to reduce and eliminate workplace accidents and injuries. Our Monro University platform has allowed us to conduct more robust and structured trainings based on a teammates’ job position, and Monro’s safety manuals are available at every workstation within our stores and distribution centers and serve as the basis for our safety training and protocols.

COVID-19

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt how we live and do business, our top priority remains the safety and wellness of our teammates and guests, while keeping our stores open wherever we can. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have continued to take significant actions to ensure the safety of our teammates and guests, including implementing safe working protocols for store teams; developing work-from-home plans for non-store teammates; assessing appropriate return-to-office protocols; and providing timely and transparent communications to teammates and key stakeholders. We also enacted numerous safety, social distancing, and cleaning measures designed to protect our teammates and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Diversity is one of our core values, and we believe that a workplace in which diverse backgrounds, experiences and ways of thinking are embraced and valued increases productivity and promotes awareness of our guests’ and communities’ unique needs. Our commitment is to have a workforce and leadership team that closely resembles our growing group of loyal customers we are working hard to attract and retain. This commitment will continue to be supported by training and awareness programs as well as focused efforts to recruit, retain, develop, and promote a diverse workforce. Our Code of Ethics lays out a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination or harassment behavior.

We have added resources to our recruitment team to implement hiring initiatives aimed at reaching diverse groups and expanded the recruitment platforms we use to broaden our pool of candidates.

We also view training as a tool to foster inclusion and, through Monro University, we provide Unconscious Bias Diversity and Inclusion Awareness courses to our teammates.

Competition

Our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive, and the number, size, and strength of competitors vary widely from region to region. We operate in the automotive repair service and tire industry, which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price, store location, name awareness, and customer service. Monro's primary competitors include national and regional undercar, tire specialty and general automotive service chains, both franchised and company-operated; car dealerships; mass merchandisers’ operating service centers; and, to a lesser extent, gas stations, independent garages, and Internet tire sellers. Monro considers TBC Corporation (operating primarily under the NTB, Midas and Tire Kingdom brands), Firestone Complete Auto Care service stores, The Pep Boys – Manny, Moe, and Jack service stores, Meineke, and Mavis Discount Tire to be direct competitors. 
Regulation

We maintain programs to facilitate compliance with various federal, state, and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including, among other things, those regarding employment and labor practices, workplace safety, building and zoning requirements, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products that we sell and use in our service bays, the recycling of batteries, tires and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property. We believe that we are in compliance with these applicable laws and regulations, and our related compliance costs are not material.

Monro stores new oil and recycled antifreeze and generates and/or handles used tires and automotive oils, antifreeze, and certain solvents, which are disposed of by licensed third-party contractors. In certain states, as required, we also recycle oil filters. Accordingly, we are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act. In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), as well as various state and local environmental protection agencies, regulate our handling and disposal of certain waste products and other materials. The EPA, under the Clean Air Act, also regulates the installation of catalytic converters, engines, and equipment sold or distributed in the United States by periodically spot-checking repair jobs, and may impose sanctions, including but not limited to civil penalties of approximately $37,500 per violation (or approximately $37,500 per day for certain willful violations or failures to cooperate with authorities), for violations of RCRA and the Clean Air Act. 

Monro strives to maintain an environmentally conscious corporate culture, demonstrated by our recycling policies at our offices, distribution centers and stores. In 2022, Monro recycled approximately 2.6 million gallons of oil and 3.4 million tires, as well as approximately 78,000 vehicle batteries and 316 tons of cardboard, all as part of our commitment to the environment.

Seasonality

Although our business is not highly seasonal, customers do purchase more undercar service during the period of March through October than the period of November through February, when miles driven tend to be lower. Sales of tires are more heavily weighted in the months of May through August, and October through December. The slowest months are typically January through April and September. As a result, profitability is typically lower during slower sales months, or months where mix is more heavily weighted toward tires, which is a lower margin category. 

Sales can also be volatile in areas in which we operate because of warmer weather in winter months, which typically causes a decline in tire sales, or severe weather, which can result in store closures.

Given our use of a fiscal calendar, there may be some fluctuations between quarters due to holiday shifts in the calendar year and the number of days in a particular fiscal quarter or year. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has had an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that may have resulted in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business.
