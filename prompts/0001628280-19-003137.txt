Our Company
We are a leading global marketing execution firm for some of the world's most marketing intensive companies, including those listed in the Fortune 1000. As a comprehensive outsourced global solution, we leverage proprietary technology, an extensive supplier network and deep domain expertise to streamline the creation, production and distribution of marketing and promotional materials, signage and displays, retail experiences, events and promotions and product packaging across every major market worldwide. The items we source generally are procured through the marketing supply chain and we refer to these items collectively as marketing materials. Through our network of more than 10,000 global suppliers, we offer a full range of fulfillment and logistics services that allow us to procure marketing materials of virtually any kind. The breadth of our product offerings and services and the depth of our supplier network enable us to fulfill the marketing materials procurement needs of our clients. 
Our proprietary software applications and databases create a fully-integrated solution that stores, analyzes and tracks the production capabilities of our supplier network, as well as detailed pricing data. As a result, we believe we have one of the largest independent repositories of supplier capabilities and pricing data for suppliers of marketing materials around the world. We leverage our supplier capabilities and pricing data to match our orders with suppliers that are optimally suited to meet the client’s needs at a highly competitive price. Our technology and databases of product and supplier information are designed to capitalize on excess manufacturing capacity and other inefficiencies in the traditional marketing materials supply chain to obtain favorable pricing while delivering high-quality products and services for our clients.

By leveraging our technology and data, our clients are able to reduce overhead costs, redeploy internal resources and obtain favorable pricing and service terms. In addition, our ability to track individual transactions and provide customized reports detailing procurement activity on an enterprise-wide basis provides our clients with greater visibility and control of their marketing materials expenditures.

We generate revenue by procuring and purchasing marketing materials from our suppliers and selling those products to our clients. We procure products for clients across a wide range of industries, such as retail, financial services, hospitality, consumer packaged goods, non-profits, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, broadcasting and cable, and transportation.

We were formed in 2001, commenced operations in 2002, and converted from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation in 2006. Our corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our annual revenue was $1.1 billion, and we operated in 67 global office locations. 
We organize our operations into three segments based on geographic regions: North America, EMEA, and LATAM. The North America segment includes operations in the United States and Canada; the EMEA segment includes operations in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia; and the LATAM segment includes operations in Mexico, Central America, and South America. We believe the opportunity exists to expand our business into new geographic markets. Our objective is to 
4

continue to increase our sales in the major markets in the United States and internationally. We intend to hire or acquire more account executives within close proximity to these large markets.
Industry Overview

Our business of providing marketing execution solutions primarily includes the procurement of marketing materials, branded merchandise, product packaging and retail displays. Based on external sources, we estimate the global market for marketing materials, product packaging, and retail displays, in aggregate, to be approximately $600 billion annually. 

Procurement of marketing materials is often dispersed across several areas of a business, including sales, marketing, communications and finance. The traditional process of procuring, designing and producing an order often requires extensive collaboration by manufacturers, designers, agencies, brokers, fulfillment and other middlemen, which is highly inefficient for the customer, who typically pays a mark-up at each intermediate stage of the supply chain. Consolidating marketing activities across the organization represents an opportunity to reduce total expenditure and decrease the number of vendors in the marketing supply chain.

To become more competitive, many large corporations seek to focus on their core competencies and outsource non-core business functions, which typically include marketing execution. According to a recent industry report, the global business process outsourcing market for managed procurement is more than $250 billion. 

We seek to capitalize on the trends impacting the marketing supply chain and the movement towards outsourcing of non-core business functions by leveraging our propriety technology, deep domain expertise, extensive supplier network and purchasing power.

Our Solution 

Utilizing our proprietary technology and data, we provide our clients a global solution to procure and deliver marketing materials at favorable prices. Our network of more than 10,000 global suppliers offers a wide variety of products and a full range of print, fulfillment and logistics services.

Our procurement software and database seeks to capitalize on excess manufacturing capacity and other inefficiencies in the traditional supply chain for marketing materials. We believe that the most competitive prices we obtain from our suppliers are offered by the suppliers with the most unused capacity. We utilize our technology to:


• | greatly increase the number of suppliers that our clients can access efficiently;


• | obtain favorable pricing and deliver high quality products and services for our clients; and


• | aggregate our purchasing power.

Our proprietary technology and data streamline the procurement process for our clients by eliminating inefficiencies within the traditional marketing supply chain and expediting production. However, our technology cannot manage all of the variables associated with procuring marketing materials, which often involves extensive collaboration among numerous parties. Effective management of the procurement process requires that dedicated and experienced personnel work closely with both clients and suppliers. Our account executives and production managers perform that critical function.

Account executives act as the primary sales staff to our clients. Production managers manage the entire procurement process for our clients to ensure timely and accurate delivery of the finished product. For each order we receive, a production manager uses our technology to gather specifications, solicit bids from the optimal suppliers, establish pricing with the client, manage production and coordinate the purchase and delivery of the finished product.

Each client is assigned an account executive and one or more production managers, who develop relationships with client personnel responsible for authorizing and making purchases. Our largest clients often are assigned multiple production managers. In certain cases, our production managers function on-site at the client's offices. Whether on-site or off-site, a production manager functions as a virtual employee of the client. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 650 production managers and account executives, including over 275 working on-site at our clients' offices. 
Our Proprietary Technology

Our proprietary technology is a fully-integrated solution that stores equipment profiles for our supplier network and price data for orders we quote and execute. Our technology allows us to match orders with the suppliers in our network that are optimally suited 
5

to produce an order at a highly competitive price. Our technology also allows us to efficiently manage the critical aspects of the procurement process, including gathering order specifications, identifying suppliers, establishing pricing, managing production and coordinating purchase and delivery of the finished product. 
Our database stores the production capabilities of our supplier network, as well as price and quote data for bids we receive and transactions we execute. As a result, we maintain one of the largest independent repositories of equipment profiles and price data for suppliers of marketing materials. Our production managers use this data to discover excess manufacturing capacity, select optimal suppliers, negotiate favorable pricing and efficiently procure high-quality products and services for our clients. We rate our suppliers based on product quality, customer service and overall satisfaction. This data is stored in our database and used by our production managers during the supplier selection process.

We believe our proprietary technology allows us to procure marketing materials more efficiently than traditional manual or semi-automated systems used by many manufacturers in the marketplace. Our technology includes the following features:


• | Customized order management. Our solution automatically generates customized data entry screens based on product type and guides the production manager to enter the required job specifications. For example, if a production manager selects “envelope” in the product field, the screen will automatically prompt the production manager to specify the size, paper type, window size and placement and display style.


• | Cost management. Our solution reconciles supplier invoices to executed orders to ensure the supplier adhered to the pricing and other terms contained in the order. In addition, it includes checks and balances that allow us to monitor important financial indicators relating to an order, such as projected gross margin and significant job alterations.


• | Standardized reporting. Our solution generates transaction reports that contain quote, supplier capability, price and customer service information regarding the orders the client has completed with us. These reports can be customized, sorted and searched based on a specified time period or the type of product, price or supplier. In addition, the reports give our clients insight into their spend for each individual job and on an enterprise-wide basis, which allows the client to track the amounts it spends on job components such as paper, production and logistics.


• | Task-tracking. Our solution creates a work order checklist that sends e-mail reminders to our production managers regarding the time elapsed between certain milestones and the completion of specified deliverables. These automated notifications enable our production managers to focus on more critical aspects of the process and eliminate delays. 


• | Historical price baseline. Some of our larger clients provide us with pricing data for orders they completed before they began to use our solution. For these clients, our solution automatically compares our current price for a job to the price obtained by the client for a comparable historical job, which enables us to demonstrate on an ongoing basis the cost savings we provide. 

We have created customized e-commerce stores on our client and third party platforms to order pre-selected products, such as personalized stationery, marketing brochures and promotional products. Automated order processes can send requests to our vendors for fulfillment or printing of variable print on demand products.

Our Clients

We procure marketing materials for corporate clients across a wide range of industries, such as retail, financial services, hospitality, consumer packaged goods, non-profits, healthcare, food and beverage, broadcasting and cable and transportation. Our clients also include manufacturers that outsource jobs to us because they do not have the requisite capabilities or capacity to complete an order. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our largest customer accounted for 5%, 5%, and 5% of our revenue, respectively. Revenue from our top ten clients accounted for 27%, 28%, and 28% of our revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

We generate revenue by procuring and purchasing marketing materials from our suppliers and selling those products to our clients. Our services are provided under long-term contracts, purchase orders, or other contractual arrangements, and the scope and terms of these contracts vary by client.

Our Products and Services

We offer a full range of solutions to support the marketing execution needs of our clients. Our outsourced print management solution encompasses the design, sourcing and delivery of printed marketing materials such as direct mail, in-store signage and marketing collateral. We provide a similar outsourced solution for the design, sourcing and delivery of other categories in the marketing supply chain, such as branded merchandise and product packaging. We also assist clients with the management of events and promotions spending and related procurement needs. Our retail environments solution involves the design, sourcing and installation 
6

of point of sale displays, permanent retail fixtures and overall store design. We also offer on-site outsourced creative studio services and digital marketing services, including retail digital display solutions.

We offer comprehensive fulfillment and logistics services, such as kitting and assembly, inventory management and pre-sorting postage. These services are often essential to the completion of the finished product. For example, we assemble multi-level direct mailings, insurance benefits packages and coupons and promotional incentives that are included with credit card and bank statements. We also provide creative services, including copywriting, graphics and website design, identity work and marketing collateral development and pre-media services, such as image and print-ready page processing and proofing capabilities. Our e-commerce and online collaboration technology empowers our clients with branded self-service ecommerce websites that prompt quick and easy online ordering, fulfillment, tracking and reporting.
We agree to provide our clients with products that conform to the industry standard of a “commercially reasonable quality” and our suppliers in turn agree to provide us with products of the same quality. The contracts we execute with our clients typically include customary provisions that limit the amount of our liability for product defects. To date, we have not experienced significant claims or liabilities relating to defective products.

Our Supplier Network

Our global network of more than 10,000 suppliers includes graphic designers, paper mills and merchants, digital imaging companies, specialty binders, finishing and engraving firms, fulfillment and distribution centers and manufacturers of displays and promotional items.

These suppliers have been selected from among thousands of potential suppliers worldwide on the basis of price, quality, delivery and customer service. We direct requests for quotations to potential suppliers based on historical pricing data, quality control rankings, and geographic proximity to a client or other criteria specified by our clients. In 2018, our top ten suppliers accounted for approximately 21% of our cost of goods sold and no supplier accounted for more than 3% of our cost of goods sold.

We have established a quality control program that is designed to ensure that we deliver high-quality products and services to our clients through the suppliers in our network.

Sales and Marketing

Our account executives sell our marketing execution solutions to corporate clients. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 325 sales and account executives. Our agreements with our account executives require them to market and sell our solutions on an exclusive basis and contain non-compete and non-solicitation provisions that apply during and for a specified period after the term of their service.

We expect to continue our growth by recruiting and retaining highly qualified account executives and providing them with the tools to be successful in the marketplace. There are a large number of experienced sales representatives globally and we believe that we will be able to identify additional qualified account executives from this pool of individuals. We also expect to augment our sales force through selective acquisitions of other businesses that offer marketing execution services, including brokers that employ experienced sales personnel with established client relationships.

We believe that we offer account executives an attractive opportunity because they can utilize our vast supplier network, proprietary pricing data and customized order management solution to sell virtually any type of marketing materials at a highly competitive price. In addition, the diverse production and service capabilities of the suppliers in our network provide our account executives the opportunity to deliver a more complete product and service offering to our clients. We believe we can better attract and retain experienced account executives than our competitors because of the breadth of products offered by our supplier network.

To date, we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified account executives. The on-boarding process consists of training with our sales management, as well as access to a variety of sales and educational resources that are available on our intranet.

Competition

Our marketing execution solutions compete with in-house procurement departments in large marketing intensive companies, creative agencies that purchase marketing materials on behalf of their clients in connection with the agencies’ marketing campaign and brand strategy services and companies in several manufacturing industries, including design, graphics art, digital imaging and 
7

fulfillment and logistics. As a result, we compete on some level with virtually every company that is involved in printing, from graphic designers to pre-press firms and fulfillment companies.

Our competitors include manufacturers that employ traditional methods of marketing and selling their printed materials. The manufacturers with which we compete generally own and operate their own manufacturing equipment and typically serve clients only within the specific product categories that their equipment produces.

We also compete with manufacturing management firms and brokers. These competitors generally do not own or operate printing equipment and typically work with a limited number of suppliers and have minimal financial investment in the quality of the products produced for their clients. Our industry experience indicates that several of these competitors offer print procurement services or enterprise software applications for the print industry.

The principal elements of competition in marketing materials procurement are price, product quality, customer service, technology and reliability. Although we believe our business delivers products and services on competitive terms, our business and the marketing execution industry are relatively new and are evolving rapidly. 

Intellectual Property

We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We also protect our proprietary technology through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and independent contractors.

Our IT infrastructure provides a high level of security for our proprietary database. The storage system for our proprietary data is designed to ensure that power and hardware failures do not result in the loss of critical data. The proprietary data is protected from unauthorized access through a combination of physical and logical security measures, including firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection software, password encryption and physical security, with access limited to authorized personnel. In addition to our security infrastructure, our system data is backed up and stored in a redundant facility on a daily basis to prevent the loss of our proprietary data due to catastrophic failures or natural disasters. We test our overall IT recovery ability and co-location facility semi-annually and test our back-up processes quarterly to verify that we can recover our business critical systems in a timely fashion.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,100 employees and independent contractors in more than 27 countries. We consider our employee relations to be strong.
