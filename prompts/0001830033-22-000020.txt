Item 1.    Business
Overview
PCT is commercializing a patented purification recycling technology (the “Technology”), originally developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), for restoring waste polypropylene into resin with near-virgin characteristics, called ultra-pure recycled (“UPR”) resin, which has nearly identical properties and applicability for reuse as virgin polypropylene. PCT has a global license for the Technology from P&G. We are currently building our first commercial scale recycling facility (the "Ironton Facility"), which is expected to have capacity of approximately 107 million pounds/year when fully operational. Production is expected to commence in late 2022 and the plant is expected to be fully operational in 2023. Our goal is to create an important new segment of the global polypropylene market that will assist multinational entities in meeting their sustainability goals, provide consumers with polypropylene-based products that are sustainable, and reduce overall polypropylene waste in the world’s landfills and oceans.
PCT’s process includes two steps: Feed Pre-Processing (“Feed PreP”) and the use of the Technology for purification. The Feed PreP step will collect, sort, and prepare polypropylene waste (“feedstock”) for purification. The purification step is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of solvent, temperature, and pressure to return the feedstock to near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit operations. The purification process puts the plastic through a physical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants and purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic without changing the bonds of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the Company is able to use significantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin.
PCT intends to build new recycling production facilities globally. In addition to the Ironton Facility, and our first cluster facility to be located in Augusta, Georgia (the “Augusta Facility”), we currently expect the next plants to be located in Asia and Europe. The Augusta Facility will be our first scaled up “cluster” site model. Pre-engineering for the design and installation of multiple commercial lines at the Augusta Facility is currently underway and is expected to create efficiencies across the construction and permitting processes.
PCT is leading the way in solvent-based polypropylene recycling. The Company’s Feedstock Evaluation Unit (“FEU”), which has been operational since July 2019, is a smaller scale replica of the Ironton Facility currently under construction. The FEU was designed to simulate commercial production and validate for PCT’s customers and suppliers the viability of our process, which has helped PCT secure 20+ year signed offtake agreements and feedstock supply agreements with large multi-national partners and industry participants. Since the commissioning of the FEU, PCT has successfully processed approximately 145 feedstocks from the United States and Europe and produced recycled polypropylene nearly identical to virgin polypropylene.
The Technology has been evaluated by third parties with a focus on the Technology’s efficacy and commercial scalability. Certain of our strategic partners have conducted testing on PCT’s UPR resin. In these evaluations, PCT’s UPR resin compared favorably to virgin polypropylene in common Food & Beverage industry benchmarks for melt flow and mechanical properties, purity, and function (lift decay, hinge break, and impact resistance). 
Industry Background
Currently, polypropylene is one of the largest contributors to the global plastics waste crisis. Each year more than 150 billion pounds of polypropylene are manufactured and incorporated into a wide array of consumer facing and industrial products. Only 5.6% of polypropylene is collected and recycled annually, compared to 20% of polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), and less than 12% of the overall plastics market is collected and recycled. Many of the advantages attributed to polypropylene (strength, toughness, elasticity) also contribute to its problematic waste stream after initial use. Due to its chemical makeup, polypropylene does not react with diluted bases and acids. Consequently, it does not break down and can remain a pollutant in our oceans, landfills, and food chain for centuries. Despite these environmental consequences, polypropylene utilization continues to increase, growing at a 5.3% average annual growth rate (“AAGR”) since 2010 with a projected AAGR of 4.3% over the next 5 years.
In response to these issues, multinational companies have partnered with non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) and trade associations to encourage recycling of plastics. Significant capital has been raised to combat the global plastics crisis, including multinational collaboration, ocean clean-up initiatives, new plastic economies, and global infrastructure investments. Furthermore, over 450 multinationals have signed commitments focused on, among other things, the reuse, recycling, or composting of all plastic packaging. Numerous multinationals have taken this pledge even further by committing to reduce the use of virgin plastic packaging by 50% by 2025. These commitments are being driven by consumer demand for sustainable products, which is expected to continue to drive many multinational corporations to source sustainable materials to achieve publicly announced sustainability objectives.
While there are a range of ways that plastics can be recycled today, there are very limited options available for polypropylene. The current options are chemical and mechanical recycling, both of which have significant drawbacks that have resulted in extremely low recycling rates. Chemical recycling requires further processing to become a viable product for fuel or plastic, which results in substantially higher energy expenditure, carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions, and inflated cost. Mechanical recycling, while more energy efficient than chemical recycling, does not remove all of the waste contaminants from the end product, leading to wide variation in end product quality and low-value end uses.
PureCycle’s Solution: Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene
PCT’s recycling technology is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of solvent, temperature and pressure. Waste stream polypropylene is returned to near near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit operations. The process puts the plastic through a physical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants and purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic with minimal controlled alteration of the physical characteristics of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the Company is able to use significantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin. The unique super-critical fluid extraction process does not require chemical reactions and provides the key benefits described below:
Key benefits of the Technology include:
•all equipment is standard processing equipment, commercially available and widely used;
•uses a physical separation/purification process without chemical reactions;
•expected to utilize approximately one fourth the amount of energy required to produce virgin polypropylene resin; and
•ability to recycle a wide range of polypropylene waste.
Our UPR resin technology results in near-virgin equivalent quality and color, and substantially improved odor profile compared to traditional recycled polypropylene. UPR resin provides our customers with 100% recycled content without compromising appearance, purity or performance in finished products. 
The Product: UPR resin
Polypropylene has multiple applications including packaging and labeling for consumer products, piping, ropes, cabling and plastic parts for many industries and, in particular, the automotive industry. It is one of the most commonly used plastics in the world due to its flexibility as a “living hinge” on consumer product lids (e.g., shampoo, condiments) since it typically will not break when bent even after multiple movements and ranges of motion.
PCT’s unique purification process separates colors, odors, and contaminants through a physical separation process. This process and end product quality have been tested and validated by P&G, prospective offtake partners, and independent third party labs. When compared to virgin resin, PCT’s UPR resin expresses near identical mechanical properties across Melt Flow Index (a measure of viscosity), Tensile Modulus (measure of stiffness), and Impact Strength (a measure of sudden resistance to force).
PCT has leveraged strategic partners with expertise in operations, the use of additives to improve the physical properties of polymers, and consumer packaged goods companies to conduct early testing to confirm that the product meets the expectations of the end users and offtake partners.
Offtake and Customers
Based on current offtake subscription agreements and letters of intent (“LOIs”), PCT intends to market and sell the UPR resin to a wide range of industries, including but not limited to: resin distributors, resin converters, consumer goods manufacturers, food and beverage producers, toy manufacturers and personal care goods producers. Polypropylene is used in a variety of end markets, including consumer packaged goods, electronics, automotive, building & construction, household goods and agriculture. Due to a growing awareness around sustainability and many multinational companies shifting their strategic focus to sustainability as a key differentiator, PCT intends to provide UPR resin to a diversified customer base across most, if not all, of these end markets over time. 
Feedstock Supply
Over 150 billion pounds of polypropylene waste feedstocks are generated every year across multiple industries. Most of these feedstocks are untapped by the market today and are disposed of in landfills and oceans. These feedstocks include flexible and rigid packaging, plastic waste from textiles, and large business segments including consumer products, medical, automotive, industrial, and agricultural.
While abundant in quantity, no traditional market for polypropylene waste feedstock currently exists. PCT’s efforts to reliably and cost-effectively source quality polypropylene waste feedstock are ongoing and primarily consist of purchasing pre-sorted polypropylene waste feedstock from various suppliers and purchasing non-sorted plastic waste that PCT itself sorts through its Feed PreP facilities. PCT’s polypropylene waste feedstock sourcing strategy will evolve as the market for polypropylene waste feedstock evolves.
The Processing Facilities
The Feedstock Evaluation Unit
The FEU is an 11,000 square foot facility located adjacent to the commercial line being built at the Ironton Facility in Lawrence County, Ohio with over 1 mile of stainless-steel piping. The facility was completed in July 2019 and has been producing UPR resin product since that time. The FEU is considered a pilot scale replica of the larger commercial line being developed at the Ironton Facility. It serves the strategic purpose of determining if new feedstock streams are of sufficient quality before introducing them into the commercial line at the Ironton Facility, as well as providing sample UPR resin to prospective customers. Quantities of offtake from the FEU have been provided to offtake partners for evaluation. To date, the product produced is within ranges acceptable under contractual offtake agreements. When the commercial line is operational, the FEU will remain a critical component for testing feedstock.
Ironton Facility
Located on the same site as the FEU, PCT commenced construction in October 2020 on the Ironton Facility. The approximately 150,000 square foot facility houses commercial-scale equipment designed to process 182 tons of feedstock per day into UPR resin, and will also be used for feedstock pre-processing and feedstock storage. An additional building has been leased for feedstock pre-processing research and development. The Ironton Facility is expected to have UPR resin capacity of approximately 107 million pounds/year when fully operational. We expect the Ironton Facility to begin production in late 2022.
Augusta Facility
PCT announced that it had secured the site location for its second purification facility in Augusta, Georgia on July 29, 2021 following an extensive and comprehensive evaluation across the Southeast, Central and Eastern United States. Ultimately, the Southeast was targeted given its ideal location for access to feedstock and multiple ports creating numerous options for exporting the UPR resin overseas. Augusta also provides a strong labor market, optimized infrastructure with access to electricity and natural gas at the site boundary, and an advanced supply chain with interstate and rail access to reduce transportation costs.
The Augusta Facility will be the Company’s first cluster facility, currently expected to be comprised of up to eight purification lines, and is designed to ultimately produce approximately 130 million pounds annually per line. The engineering design is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022 with site work expected to begin shortly thereafter.
PreP Facilities
In conjunction with the construction of the Augusta Facility, PCT will also build and operate Feed PreP facilities in locations geographically near the feed sources to optimize PCT’s supply chain economics. PCT will locate its first Feed PreP facility in Winter Garden, Florida, which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2022. Throughout the second half of 2021, PCT developed a feedstock processing system with advanced sorting capabilities that can handle various types of plastics in addition to polypropylene (designated as no. 5 plastic). PCT’s enhanced sorting should allow PCT to process and procure all plastic bales between no. 3 and no. 7. PCT’s new Feed PreP facilities will extract polypropylene and ship it to PCT’s purification lines, while the non-polypropylene feed will be sorted, baled, and subsequently sold on the open market. 
Government Regulation
PCT is subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States that prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety, regulate PCT’s products, and the manufacturing, labeling, marketing, promotion, and advertising thereof.
PCT is also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations, marketing claims and other laws, including but not limited to consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. PCT’s operations, and those of its suppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.
FDA Requirements
Recycled polypropylene in food packaging applications in the U.S. is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA has established certain requirements for the use of polypropylene in food packaging, as well as guidelines for the use of recycled plastics in food packaging. On a voluntary basis, companies may ask FDA to issue a Letter of No Objection (“LNO”) to provide assurance to customers regarding regulatory compliance and safety of systems that recycle polymers.
On September 10, 2021, after conducting necessary laboratory testing and reviewing results with its
consultants over several months, PCT filed for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Letter of No
Objection (“LNO”) for Conditions of Use A - H. Conditions of Use describe the temperature and duration at which a material should be tested to simulate the way the material is intended to be used. The LNO submission also defines the feedstock sources for the Company’s planned commercial recycling process, and this LNO submission includes curbside post-consumer recycled and food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks.
The FDA confirmed receipt of the submission on September 13, 2021 and followed up with additional questions and request for clarification in a letter received by PCT on January 7, 2022. In its letter, the FDA took the position that one of the migration calculations was incorrect. PCT responded to the FDA’s questions on February 17, 2022. Consequently, PCT revised its application solely for Conditions of Use C-G based on a review of the revised calculations. PCT is awaiting a determination from the FDA on this revised submission.
Conditions of Use C-G address many consumer product packaging requirements, including applications for hot filled and pasteurized, as well as room temperature, refrigerated and frozen applications. Generally speaking, Conditions of Use A, B and H relate to extreme temperature applications. While awaiting a determination on Conditions of Use C-G, PCT is taking steps to initiate new testing protocols for Conditions of Use A, B and H and intends to pursue an LNO for these Conditions of Use following receipt of satisfactory test results.
Environmental and Workplace Safety Laws
PCT is subject to air, water, waste and other environmental, commercial and workplace safety laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level in the United States including requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
Recycled polypropylene for use in non-food packaging uses complies with or is exempt from EPA’s requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), since polypropylene (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN) 9003-07-0) is approved for use on the TSCA Chemical Substances Inventory and the manufacture of polymers is exempt from TSCA Chemical Data Reporting. Additive selection will also comply with the TSCA.
PCT is subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations that address the release of hazardous substances into the air, water and land, and the storage, handling, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials. PCT holds various state and local licenses and permits, some of which are perpetual, and others which renew periodically. These include both environmental and general business licenses. Larger multi-line locations may also fall under federal Title V permitting rules.
OSHA and the delegated states implement the Occupational Safety and Health Act and relevant state counterparts. In relevant part, this requires hazard identification and communication about materials used or produced in operations to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Other workplace safety rules, such as those governing confined space entry and process safety management, also apply to PCT’s operations, and PCT’s facility is subject to OSHA inspection. PCT’s operations are subject to privacy laws and federal and state laws governing labor and employment matters such as minimum wage, overtime, working conditions and employment eligibility requirements.
The FTC requires that marketing and advertising by PCT and its feedstock suppliers be truthful, non-misleading, not deceptive to consumers, and consistent with the Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, 16 C.F.R. Part 260, concerning recycling claims. The federal Lanham Act and federal antitrust laws govern PCT’s business activities and advertising claims. State law equivalents of false advertising claims laws apply and these laws may differ from each other in significant ways. They often are not preempted by federal laws.
Regulation Outside the United States
The commercialization of our product in countries other than the U.S. may require that PCT, or companies with whom PCT partners for such foreign commercialization, obtain necessary approvals for food packaging use under foreign regulatory regimes comparable to that of the FDA. Applicable approval processes and ongoing requirements in international markets vary from country to country and may involve more time and expense than that required to obtain approvals in the U.S. We intend to meet these requirements ourselves or through distributors as required.
Intellectual Property
Pursuant to the License Agreement, P&G has granted PCT a license to utilize P&G’s intellectual property, and PCT has granted a sublicense of P&G intellectual property back to P&G under the terms of the License Agreement, with a limited right to sublicense by P&G (the “Grant Back”) subject to volume and geographic restrictions. Under the Grant Back, for five years after the effective date of the License Agreement, the aggregate tonnage that may be produced under the Grant Back will be capped at 500,000 metric tons per year worldwide. Beyond year 5, that aggregate annual tonnage will be expanded to enable modest expansion across each of the six regions worldwide (generally, North America, Europe, China, Asia, Africa and Latin America).
PCT has a limited right to sublicense the technology to PCT affiliates and select third parties with the consent of P&G. All thirteen filed and granted patents are utility patents (as opposed to design patents and applications). All of the patents relate to the same core PCT technology processes. This patent estate covers the proprietary process by which waste polypropylene is converted into ultra-pure recycled polypropylene, specifically the method for separating and purifying polymers from the reclaimed and contaminated polypropylene, polyethylene and other polymers. The License Agreement also governs the ownership of process 
improvements. Improvements (as defined in the License Agreement) invented by PCT are owned by PCT and are licensed back to P&G for the purpose of selling licensed product, while Improvements (as defined in the License Agreement) invented by P&G or jointly by P&G and PCT are owned by P&G and licensed to PCT. The license may become non-exclusive if PCT fails to make payments or undergoes a change of control without the prior written consent of P&G. If PCT defaults under the License Agreement and the License Agreement is terminated, P&G fails to perform its obligations under these agreements, or PCT’s relationship with P&G is otherwise damaged or severed, this could have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, results of operations or financial performance. In addition, P&G’s failure to consent to future sublicenses by PCT to PCT affiliates and select third parties would limit PCT’s ability to expand as contemplated by its current business plan.
The License Agreement will terminate upon the later of (a) the expiration of the last Licensed Patent (as defined in the License Agreement) to expire and (b) the expiry date of the warrant between PCT and P&G (which was executed on October 16, 2020). Under the License Agreement, thirteen Utility Patents were filed and granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Each Utility Patent will expire on the 20-year anniversary of the original application filing date. Together, these thirteen Utility Patents make up the Licensed Patents.
Human Capital Resources 
Employees & Demographics. As of December 31, 2021, PCT employed 119 employees. None of PCT’s employees are represented by a labor union. With respect to demographics, approximately 30% of our employees are female and 70% are male. There will be expected additions to our staff in 2022 as our operations expand to support the initial operation of the Ironton Facility, the construction of Feed PreP facilities, the construction of the Augusta Facility and other initiatives.
Talent & Turnover. With a focus on talent acquisition, the leadership team seeks out the most qualified candidates for open roles and endeavors to keep them at PCT. We have a robust program for seeking out those candidates, which ranges from sourcing through talent applications, reviewing direct applicants and using internal referrals to fill roles. Additionally, we strive to promote internally, if applicable. Our program has resulted in a turnover rate of 7.5% to date.
Compensation Practice & Pay Equality. As PCT evolves and expands operations, Human Resources in partnership with the leadership team will continue to evaluate the existing workforce to ensure that best practices are maintained across the entire team without risk of inequality. Pay structures will be reviewed annually to ensure best practices in a competitive market and, as part of that review, compensation will be realigned where appropriate for existing employees and new hires.
