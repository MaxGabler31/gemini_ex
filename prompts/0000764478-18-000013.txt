Item 1.  Business.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us" and "our" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.
Description of Business
We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966. Today, we are a leading provider of technology products, services and solutions. We offer these products and services to customers who visit our stores, engage with Geek Squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications. We have retail operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
Segments and Geographic Areas
We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S., under various brand names including Best Buy, bestbuy.com, Best Buy Mobile, Best Buy Direct, Best Buy Express, Geek Squad, Magnolia Home Theater and Pacific Kitchen and Home. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.
In March 2015, we decided to consolidate Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand. This resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stores and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best Buy brand. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. We expect the majority of these stores to close during the half of fiscal 2019. Additional information on these changes is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 4, Restructuring Charges, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial information about our segments and geographic areas is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 11, Segment and Geographic Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operations
Our Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments operate a multi-channel platform that allows customers to shop when and where they want.
Domestic Segment
Development of merchandise and services offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile application operations, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support capabilities (for example, human resources, finance and real estate management) are generally performed at our corporate headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail teams from our corporate headquarters and regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized within each store brand. All stores within each store brand generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics. 
International Segment
Our Canada and Mexico store operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment.
Merchandise and Services
Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories: Consumer Electronics, Computing and Mobile Phones, Entertainment, Appliances, Services and Other. The key components of each revenue category are as follows:
4


• | Consumer Electronics - digital imaging, health and fitness, home automation, home theater and portable audio (including headphones, portable speakers and voice assistants);


• | Computing and Mobile Phones - computing and peripherals, e-readers, mobile phones (including related mobile network carrier commissions), networking, tablets and wearables (including smartwatches);


• | Entertainment - drones, gaming hardware and software, movies, music, technology toys, virtual reality and other software;


• | Appliances - major appliances (for example, dishwashers, laundry, ovens, refrigerators, etc.) and small appliances (for example, blenders, coffee makers, etc.);


• | Services - consultation, delivery, design, educational classes, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up and technical support; and


• | Other - beverages, snacks, sundry items and other product offerings within our International segment (including baby, luggage and sporting goods).

Distribution
Domestic Segment
U.S. Best Buy online merchandise sales are typically either picked up at U.S. Best Buy stores or delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the U.S. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers.
International Segment
Our Canada and Mexico distribution model is similar to our Domestic segment model.
Suppliers and Inventory
Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2018, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and Lenovo – representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.
We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.
We also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brand products.
Store Development
We had approximately 1,200 large-format and 300 small-format stores at the end of fiscal 2018 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our multi-channel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores in the U.S. and all of our large-format stores in Canada. Customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores. Beginning in 2013, we opened vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnership and a higher quality customer experience. In fiscal 2019 and beyond, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations, as evidenced by our recent announcement to close all of our remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S.
Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.

Intellectual Property
We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Best Buy Express, Dynex, Geek Squad, Insignia, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Sales, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Rocketfish, Platinum and our Yellow Tag logo.
We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales. 
Competition
Our competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to deliver a high-quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. In addition, in the U.S., online-only operators are not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain states. We believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are re-evaluated at both the state and federal levels. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers, and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have a price-matching policy in the U.S. that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, integrated online and retail assets, broad product assortment, strong vendor relationships, range of focused service and support offerings, distinct store formats, brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage.
Environmental Matters
We work hard to positively impact the environment and our communities. We believe that reducing our impact on the environment via realistic yet assertive sustainability goals and advancing energy-efficient consumer solutions helps create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.  

We continuously look for cost-effective solutions to minimize carbon emissions in our operations. In fiscal 2018, we set a new goal to reduce our own carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2020 (over a 2009 baseline), from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing, and we currently expect to meet or exceed this goal. 

Refer to our Best Buy Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report on our website for further information on environmental performance.
Number of Employees
At the end of fiscal 2018, we employed approximately 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and our sourcing office in China. We consider our employee relations to be good. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.
