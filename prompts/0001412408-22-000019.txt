Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading provider of comprehensive software solutions that improve the operational and financial performance of healthcare organizations by activating patients in their care to optimize patient health outcomes. Through our SaaS-based technology platform, which we refer to as the Phreesia Platform or our Platform, we offer healthcare services clients a robust suite of integrated solutions that manage patient access, registration, payments and clinical support. Our Platform also provides life sciences companies, patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations with a channel for targeted and direct communication with patients. In fiscal 2022, we facilitated patient visits in over 2,000 healthcare services clients across all 50 states. We define a patient visit as an individual, in-person or telehealth visit to a healthcare services provider, which may include multiple encounters by the same patient. Additionally, our Platform processed nearly $2.8 billion in patient payments in fiscal 2022 of which 79% were credit and debit card patient payment volume that we processed as a payment facilitator. Payment facilitator volume is a major driver of our payment processing revenue.
Patient intake is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous tasks, including registration, insurance verification, patient questionnaires, patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, payments and scheduling. Inefficiencies during the intake process often result in lower satisfaction for patients and healthcare services organizations, wasted time, missed revenue opportunities and diminished health outcomes. Phreesia’s mission is to create a better, more engaging healthcare experience. We have created an integrated and streamlined system that automates data capture and activates patients before, during and after their interaction with their healthcare services provider. As evidenced in industry survey reports from healthcare IT research firm KLAS, we have been recognized as a market leader based on our integration capabilities with healthcare services organizations, the broad adoption of our software solutions, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by overall client satisfaction.
The Phreesia Platform encompasses a comprehensive range of technologies and services, including, but not limited to, initial patient contact, registration, appointment scheduling, payments and post-appointment patient surveys. The Phreesia Platform securely collects and analyzes each patient’s information and provides engagement tools to efficiently guide each patient through their healthcare journey. We deploy our Platform across a range of modalities, including through patients’ mobile devices (Phreesia Mobile), through a web-based dashboard for healthcare services clients (Phreesia Dashboard) and through our proprietary, self-service intake tablets (PhreesiaPads) and on-site kiosks (Arrivals Kiosks), all of which provide an individualized experience for each patient based on age, gender, appointment type and other clinical and demographic factors. Our solutions are highly customizable and scalable to any size healthcare service organization and can seamlessly integrate within a client’s workflows and leading Practice Management, or PM, and Electronic Health Record, or EHR, systems. Our Platform additionally allows for secure time-of-service and post-explanation of benefits integrated payments.
We serve an array of healthcare services clients of all sizes across over 25 specialties, ranging from single-specialty practices, including internal and family medicine, urology, dermatology, and orthopedics, to large, multi-specialty groups, health systems as well as regional and national payers and other organizations that provide other types of healthcare-related services. Our life sciences revenue is generated from clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries as well as patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations seeking to activate, engage and educate patients about topics critical to their health. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist, our solutions are providing our clients with tools to help them stay open, keep patients and staff safe, and navigate a shifting landscape. We offer solutions for managing COVID-19 vaccine delivery and identifying vaccine-hesitant patients, screening for self-reported COVID-19 risk factors, enabling contactless check-in during in-person visits, and collecting intake information during telehealth visits.
Our Platform
The Phreesia Platform offers our clients the following set of solutions that activate patients in their care:
•Our access solution provides a comprehensive appointment scheduling system to provide clients with applications for online appointments, reminders and referral tracking and management.
•Our registration solution automates patient self-registration via Phreesia Mobile—either before or at the time of the patient’s visit—or through the use of a purpose-built PhreesiaPad or Arrivals Kiosk for on-site check-in. 
Table of Contents

The solution also includes the Phreesia Dashboard, which healthcare services organization staff use to monitor and manage the intake process.
•Our revenue cycle solution provides insurance-verification processes, point-of-sale payments applications and cost estimation presentment tools, which help healthcare services clients maximize the timely collection of patient payments.
•Our clinical support solution collects clinical intake and patient reported outcome ("PRO") data for more than 25 specialties, enabling our clients to ask the right clinical questions of the appropriate patients at the right time and gather key data that aligns with their quality-reporting goals. The solution also enables healthcare services clients to communicate with their patients through automated, tailored surveys, announcements, text and email messaging and targeted health campaigns. 
•Our life sciences solution provides a channel to our life sciences clients that leverages our large and growing network of over 2,000 healthcare services clients. We utilize this channel to activate patients through the delivery of targeted and clinically relevant content to patients, which allows them to have more informed conversations with their providers. We also enable our life sciences clients to receive direct patient feedback to incorporate into their business models.
The Phreesia Platform provides significant and measurable value to patients, healthcare services organizations and life sciences companies. For patients, we provide a safe, seamless, individualized intake experience and flexible payment options. For healthcare services clients, we enable them to increase collections, streamline the referral process, improve quality measures, increase patient satisfaction and consistently collect key clinical, demographic and social data. Based on client feedback and our internal analysis, we believe that the majority of our healthcare services clients have been able to increase time-of-service collections after subscribing to our solutions. For all of our clients, we aim to increase patient knowledge, skills, and confidence related to their health, and to increase their awareness of relevant marketed products. Based on ongoing analyses of client marketing campaigns conducted by data analytics companies, we believe patients exposed to a brand or disease awareness campaign using the Phreesia Platform are significantly more likely, on average, to take an action, such as having a prescription filled for that product, than control patients.
The Phreesia Platform has evolved to provide a comprehensive range of technology applications and modules that address the growing needs of the healthcare market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our market opportunity
The Phreesia Platform serves a range of healthcare services clients, including single-specialty practices, large multi-specialty groups and health systems. Through our life sciences solutions, we provide services to large and small pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. We believe the current addressable market for our Platform and services is approximately $9.0 billion and is derived from: (1) the potential subscription and related services revenue generated from the approximately 1.3 million U.S.-based healthcare services organizations who take medical appointments in ambulatory care settings and who work in hospital settings, (2) consumer-related transaction and payment processing fees, which are based on a percentage of payments that can be processed via the Phreesia Platform and address approximately $93.0 billion of annual out of pocket patient spend in ambulatory healthcare related professional services, and (3) a portion of the $6.0 billion spent by life sciences companies on direct-to-consumer prescription drug marketing. We estimate that our target client universe in the ambulatory and hospital markets is approximately 50,000 unique healthcare services clients. As we develop new products and services on the Phreesia Platform and through our recent extension into the payer market, we expect our total addressable market to grow.
Our value proposition
We are focused on creating a better, more engaging healthcare experience for patients, healthcare services organizations and life sciences companies. We believe our solutions provide a unique value proposition that is differentiated from what is offered by the traditional healthcare system.
Value proposition for patients
•Improved patient experience. Our Platform streamlines the patient intake process and provides consumer-centric options for check-in. We pre-populate information from prior visits, minimizing the frustration of repetitive questions during the intake process and streamlining the information for review by a clinician by the time the 
Table of Contents

patient reaches the exam room. We also offer patients a convenient, flexible, secure intake experience that saves time and reduces the confusion and anxiety around payments. Additionally, our cost estimation presentment tools allow patients to receive an accurate estimate of their out-of-pocket spend for a particular service prior to receiving care. Patients are also able to save time by making their appointments using our technology.
•Flexible payment options. Our Platform provides patients with flexibility and choice in how they pay for healthcare services. Patients are able to pay upfront or set up an automated payment plan that adheres to our healthcare services clients' financial policies. Patients can also choose to pay online on their healthcare services organization’s website or place a card on file. Our Platform also removes the need for difficult payment-related conversations with staff and ensures a level of personal privacy throughout the transaction.
•Activation in care. By leveraging the power of self-service and providing individualized and flexible software solutions, we activate patients early in their healthcare journey and provide them with relevant information to further educate them so they can take an active role in their healthcare decisions.
Value proposition for healthcare services clients
•Simplify operations and enhance staff efficiency. We enable healthcare services clients to streamline operations through automated patient intake and payments that are integrated into existing workflows and PM and EHR systems. By automating the numerous tasks of the intake process, our healthcare services clients have been able to save time on patient check-ins.
•Improve cash flow and profitability. We enable our healthcare services clients to increase collections and reduce costs. Based on client feedback received and our internal analysis, we believe that our flexible patient payment options, including card on file, have led to an increase in time-of-service collections for the majority of our healthcare services clients. Our automated eligibility and benefits verification solution also reduces the number of denied claims.
•Enhance clinical and cost outcomes. We enable our healthcare services clients to more efficiently and effectively capture the right clinical information to meet their clinical goals and align with quality reporting initiatives. Our logic-driven targeting and delivery of PROs and other questionnaires help healthcare services clients identify and target at-risk patients in need of specific care and reduce errors by avoiding the need to manually gather the information. These PROs enable our healthcare services clients to close gaps in care, identify successful treatments and engage patients in their care. Through our subsidiary, Insignia Health, LLC, ("Insignia"), we license the exclusive worldwide rights to the Patient Activation Measure ("PAM"®), which we believe is widely viewed as the gold standard of patient activation measures. Extensive research over the past decade suggests that the PAM could be a critical pathway in helping healthcare services clients achieve the goals of reducing costs and improving the health of those they care for.
•Improve patient experience. We activate patients through their journey from access to registration to drive higher patient satisfaction, retention and safety. Our streamlined intake and payments offering provides a consumer-friendly experience and activates patients to take control of their care. Through our patient surveys, healthcare services clients are able to conduct outreach to patients within 24 hours of visit and generate real-time feedback that informs and drives improvement efforts.
Value proposition for life sciences organizations
•Targeted, direct digital marketing. We provide life sciences companies with a channel to activate patients by identifying, reaching, educating and communicating with patients when they are most receptive and actively seeking care. Our data-driven solutions provide custom, targeted patient outreach based on various demographic, clinical, environmental and social data, allowing our clients to activate patients with clinically relevant medical content to help facilitate conversations with their providers about treatment and prevention options.
•Improve brand conversion, treatment, and adherence. Our data and analytics capabilities identify patient populations that align with our life sciences clients’ target audiences. Based on our ongoing analyses of client marketing campaigns conducted by data analytics companies, we believe patients exposed to a brand campaign using the Phreesia Platform are more likely, on average, to take an action, such as having a prescription filled for that product, than control patients. Integration with our point-of-care solutions, which activates our patients in their own care, increases incremental prescriptions with existing patients, driving an adherence benefit and strong return to our clients.
•Improve diagnosis and uptake of preventative health services. Our data and analytics capabilities identify patient populations that align with our life sciences clients’ target audiences. Based on our ongoing analyses of 
Table of Contents

client marketing and education campaigns conducted by data analytics companies, we believe patients exposed to such campaigns using the Phreesia Platform are more likely, on average, to receive a relevant diagnosis, or undergo a preventative health screening, or receive a relevant treatment, than control patients. 
•Feedback from patient voice. Our Patient Insights solution provides a channel for our life sciences clients to deliver real-time, dynamic surveys to highly targeted patients and capture direct patient feedback and access relevant population insights.
  Our competitive landscape
We compete in a dynamic patient intake market with direct and indirect competitors that maintain varying degrees of resources and capabilities. We believe many direct competitors are focused on the basic aspects of electronic patient intake and are only starting to expand into the multiple adjacencies beyond patient registration such as access and clinical support. Some of our existing and potential service providers, particularly EHR providers, have developed their own patient intake solutions and have become direct competitors. The Phreesia Platform is integrated with a majority of the leading EHR systems, and we have entered into agreements designed for shared financial success. KLAS, an independent healthcare information technology research firm, evaluates Phreesia against many of these direct competitors and named Phreesia the top-ranked patient intake management vendor for 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on direct feedback from healthcare organizations across the country.
We believe companies in the market for comprehensive software solutions, including patient intake, compete on the basis of several factors, including: 
•price;
•breadth, depth, quality and reliability of product and service offerings;
•ease of use;
•ability to drive tangible return on investment;
•client-focused implementation services and training programs;
•healthcare domain expertise; 
•patient clinical content offerings;
•client support and client services; and 
•ability to integrate with all of a client’s existing systems, including EHR and/or PM systems.
Life sciences marketing is highly competitive and rapidly evolving and consists of both traditional media platforms (e.g. television and print media) as well as more modern web-based and application-based platforms that provide direct-to-consumer marketing for the life sciences industries. Our targeted marketing solutions are unique and compete at the point of care as well as pre- and post-visit across an array of digital devices backed by our commitment to transparency and third-party auditing. We compete on the basis of several factors, including price, quality, transparency and the ability to demonstrate meaningful return on investment. 
Our growth strategies
The success of our business depends on acquiring new clients and increasing utilization among our existing clients, which in turn drives growth across our Platform and solutions. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from a number of prevailing industry tailwinds across our patient access, registration, revenue cycle, clinical support and life sciences solution areas. We intend to continue to proactively grow the business through the following strategies:
Expanding our Platform to new healthcare services organizations
The market for a technology-powered intake and payment platform in the U.S. healthcare industry is early, large and underserved, and we believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our client base and market share. With the ability to support over 25 different medical specialties and existing agreements with leading PM and EHR providers, the Phreesia Platform is able to serve a large portion of the U.S. ambulatory and acute care market. The Phreesia Platform is currently used by a small percentage of ambulatory and acute care organizations, and we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force to win new clients.
Deepening our relationship with existing healthcare services clients
We generate recurring fees from our healthcare services clients based on the number of subscriptions to our base platform plus subscriptions for any add-on applications. As our healthcare services clients realize the value of the Phreesia Platform, they typically purchase additional subscriptions for their organizations. Our sales strategy is focused on expanding our revenue per healthcare services client and we believe there is a significant opportunity to sell new applications as well as add additional healthcare services clients.

Continuing to innovate and leverage our Platform to optimize healthcare delivery
We believe the depth, scalability and robust capabilities of our Phreesia Platform allow us to address key challenges facing healthcare delivery. As an innovative leader in the patient intake market, we intend to continue to invest in new value-added offerings for our clients. We have a well-defined technology roadmap to introduce new features and functionality to the Phreesia Platform that activate patients in their care. We intend to leverage our patient database and patient activation capabilities to eliminate gaps in care and increase care coordination among all key healthcare constituents. By expanding and continuously enhancing the Phreesia Platform, we believe we can drive incremental revenue from existing clients as well as broaden the appeal of our solutions to potential new clients. 
Pursuing opportunistic strategic investments, partnerships and acquisitions
Our strong growth has been mostly organic, as we have added healthcare services clients and life sciences companies to our Platform, while also expanding the solutions we offer those clients. Through our history, we have effectively partnered with leading PM and EHR solution providers and will continue to evaluate strategic and innovative investments and partnerships to accelerate growth. We also have acquired products and functionalities that complement our offering. We evaluate many investment, partnership and acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis. We target opportunities that enhance the breadth or depth of our ability to activate patients in their care. Our acquisitions to date have all been consistent with this philosophy. In December 2018, we acquired Vital Score, Inc., which expanded our clinical and patient activation offerings and deepened our capabilities in motivational science. In October 2020, we acquired two software applications co-developed by Geisinger Health and Merck, which provide know-how around patient communication and care delivery. In January 2021, we acquired QueueDr to further address the need for healthcare services organizations to reduce patient appointment cancellations and no-shows, and ultimately accelerate patient access to care. In December 2021, we acquired Insignia, which gave us the exclusive worldwide license to the PAM, a measure that we believe is widely viewed as the gold standard for measuring patient activation. We will continue to evaluate growth opportunities that complement our internal initiatives.
Enhancing our margins through continued strategic growth
Our business model is based on developing and deploying new, value-added applications for our clients that increase revenue and enhance our attractive client unit economics. We have invested significantly and expect to continue investing significantly to create a comprehensive, scalable technology platform that allows us to gain operating leverage and enhance margins. Over time, we expect to increase profitability and margins by adding larger new clients to our Platform and by expanding our existing clients with minimal incremental investments in our Platform. Moreover, we continually aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our Platform. 
Our products and services
Our Platform and suite of solutions are specifically designed to cater to the needs of patients, healthcare services clients and life sciences companies while improving healthcare engagement.

We are committed to providing top-quality services and support, and we have been recognized for high performance in integration, implementation support and overall client satisfaction.
Regulatory Matters
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Moreover, in many jurisdictions in which we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. In addition, our consumer transactions business is subject to certain financial services laws, regulations and rules, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. 
U.S. state and federal health information privacy and security laws 
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, including health information. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, referred to as PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our healthcare services customers are regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. As a service provider who creates, receives, maintains or transmits PHI on behalf of our covered entity customers, Phreesia is a “business associate” as defined under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, certain HIPAA requirements are also directly applicable to business associates. 
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, business associates must notify covered entities of a breach, and those covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. In the event of a breach, our covered entity customers may require we provide assistance in the breach notification process and may seek indemnification and other contractual remedies. 
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus

Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts. 
Other federal and state laws restrict the use and protect the privacy and security of personally identifiable information. Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, and are, in many cases, not preempted by HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. California recently enacted and has proposed companion regulations to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA has been in effect since January 1, 2020, and the California State Attorney General began enforcement on July 1, 2020. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). While any information we maintain in our role as a business associate may be exempt from the CCPA, other records and information we maintain on our customers may be subject to the CCPA. The CCPA and CPRA have prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation and in some states efforts to pass comprehensive privacy laws have been successful. For example, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA. The CDPA will become effective January 1, 2023. The CDPA will regulate how businesses (which the CDPA refers to as “controllers”) collect and share personal information. While the CDPA incorporates many similar concepts of the CCPA and CPRA, there are also several key differences in the scope, application, and enforcement of the law that will change the operational practices of controllers. The new law will impact how controllers collect and process personal sensitive data, conduct data protection assessments, transfer personal data to affiliates, and respond to consumer rights requests.
Also, on July 8, 2021, Colorado’s governor signed the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, into law. The CPA is rather similar to Virginia’s CDPA, but also contains additional requirements. The new measure applies to companies conducting business in Colorado or who produce or deliver commercial products or services intentionally targeted to residents of the state that either: (1) control or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers during a calendar year; or (2) derive revenue or receive a discount on the price of goods or services from the sale of personal data and process or control the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers. 
With the CPA, Colorado became the third state to enact a comprehensive privacy law but a number of additional other states have proposed bills for comprehensive consumer privacy laws and it is quite possible that other states certain of these bills will follow suit. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country, if enacted, will add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, and has resulted in and will result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with these additional state laws. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some state laws, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. 
In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws. Such laws, for example, could include state laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. 
In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts with our business associates, we must

report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others. 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) 
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, is a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls and faxes. Since its inception, the TCPA’s purview has extended to text messages sent to consumers. Our services that leverage text messaging are subject to the TCPA and the regulations thereunder. 
U.S. corporate practice of medicine; fee splitting 
Approximately 30 states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as Phreesia, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws, which vary among the states that have enacted them, are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. We frequently enter into services contracts with healthcare services clients pursuant to which we provide them with revenue cycle management, insurance enrollment verification, patient intake, scheduling, appointment reminders and a range of other services. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates, the provision of medical equipment and the hiring and management of clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. 
Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our agreements with healthcare services clients licensed in the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our healthcare services clients, may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with our healthcare services clients constitute unlawful fee splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to, among other things, adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our healthcare services clients, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of healthcare services organization licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our healthcare services clients that interfere with our business and other materially adverse consequences. 
U.S. federal contracting laws
Our subsidiary, Insignia, as a federal government contractor, is obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, ("FAR"), in connection with its performance of its government contracts. Insignia’s obligations under the FAR include, for example, calculating overhead rates in accordance with the accounting procedures and internal controls required under the FAR standards. Consequences for violating the FAR and other laws and regulations applicable to government contracting include termination of contracts, suspension or debarment from doing future business with the government, criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act (as described below), and other penalties.
U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
We may be subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing, ordering, arranging, or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines and penalties up to three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. Imposition of any of these penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed 
Table of Contents

protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. On December 2, 2020, the OIG published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in the Federal Register. Under the final rule, the OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. On the same day, CMS published a final rule that provides an exception for value-based compensation agreements under the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. However, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that these final rules did not meet the sixty-day delay required under the Congressional Review Act ("CRA"). Additionally, on January 20, 2021, the Biden administration issued a moratorium on all Trump-era rules that have not yet taken effect. Due to the CRA delay and the Biden administration moratorium, it is not clear when these safe harbors and exceptions will be effective. We continue to monitor the impact this change may have on our business.
False Claims Act 
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare services organizations and their service providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, some states have adopted similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims provisions. 
State fraud and abuse laws 
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
Other healthcare laws 
HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payers of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare services organization knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payers as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs. 
In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular healthcare services organization, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, healthcare services organizations who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can

impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Further, in October 2020, OIG released an opinion indicating it also does not favor patient assistance programs. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles, as well as patient assistance programs, offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. 
Intellectual property
Our continued growth and success depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including the Phreesia Platform. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade secrets and other contractual rights, including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. 
However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from creating a competitive SaaS platform or otherwise competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2022, we had 1,701 full-time employees, including 359 in services and support, 762 in sales and marketing, 379 in research and development and 201 in general and administrative. As of January 31, 2022, we had 1,146 full-time employees in the United States and 555 full-time employees internationally. We also supplement our workforce with contractors and consultants, including a substantial number of developers working in research and development in international locations. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Talent and Culture: The success and continued evolution of our company has been due in large part to the talent and engagement of the entire Phreesia team. Our team members are key pillars of our success and fostering and developing their talent is central to our culture. Attracting and retaining top talent is a high priority for us, and we look to hire smart, passionate, diverse and driven individuals who want to be a part of our mission. Our strong company culture and investment in long-term career growth for our people is evidenced by the long tenure of many of our team members with our organization. We believe our success is due in large part to the continued engagement of our talented and committed team. During our fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, Modern Healthcare magazine recognized Phreesia as one of the “Best Places to Work in Healthcare” for the fifth time, and Inc. magazine recognized Phreesia as one of the "Best Led Companies of 2021", optimally positioning us to continue to attract top healthcare and technology talent. 
Diversity and Inclusiveness: We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) support our commitment to promoting and maintaining an inclusive culture for all employees by bringing together individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. These groups seek to foster a sense of shared community and empowerment for employees who share a common social identity, such as gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. Phreesians can voluntarily join an ERG to network, discuss and exchange ideas and enhance their professional development. 
We recognize that our ability to execute on our mission of creating a better, more engaging experience depends on our people. We are committed to supporting gender equality in our organization, including through our inclusive culture, board representation, pathways to leadership for women, pay equity and strong family-leave policies. 
We published our second Phreesia Gender Equality Report in 2021 based on the framework provided by the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index to which Phreesia was added in January 2022.
Remote Workforce: We have operated as a fully remote company since 2020, as we believe this arrangement allows us access to the best talent and creates optimal flexibility for our employees.
