 Item 1. Business.
e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company,” “e.l.f.,” “we,” “us,” “its” and “our”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on December 20, 2013 under the name J.A. Cosmetics Holdings, Inc. In April 2016, we changed our name to e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. We conduct business under the name e.l.f. Cosmetics, and offer high-quality, prestige-inspired products to consumers through our retail customers, e.l.f. stores and e-commerce channels.
e.l.f.: Changing the face of beauty
We are one of the fastest growing, most innovative beauty companies in the United States. Driven by our mission to make luxurious beauty accessible for all, we have challenged the traditional belief that quality cosmetics and skin care are only available at high prices in select channels. e.l.f. offers high-quality, prestige-inspired beauty products at extraordinary value. Our price points encourage trial and experimentation, while our commitment to quality and a differentiated consumer engagement model engenders loyalty among a passionate and vocal group of consumers.
We believe our success is rooted in our innovation process and ability to build direct consumer relationships. Born as an e-commerce company over a decade ago, we have created a modern consumer engagement and responsive innovation model that keeps our products on-trend and our consumers engaged as brand ambassadors. Our consumers provide us with real-time feedback through reviews and social media, which enables us to refine and augment our product assortment in response to their needs. We are able to launch high-quality products quickly by leveraging our fast-cycle product development and asset-light supply chain. Our products are first launched on elfcosmetics.com, and distribution is generally only broadened to our retail customers after we receive strong consumer validation online.
Our brand appeals to some of the most sought after consumers in the category. We believe the combination of our affordable price points and on-trend, innovative product assortment encourages trial, offers a strong value proposition and appeals to a broad base of consumers. Relative to the overall cosmetics category, our brand over-indexes with Millennials, multi-cultural consumers and some of the heaviest users in the category. This attractive and loyal consumer base supports high sales per linear foot and higher category sales for our retail customers. By combining our strong relationships with leading retailers with consumer engagement in our e.l.f. stores and through e-commerce, we are a true multi-channel brand.
Our history
We were founded in 2004 and have sought to disrupt the traditional beauty model of high prices, long product cycles and traditional advertising. Utilizing sourcing relationships in China, we rapidly created prestige-inspired products at an affordable price. Bypassing traditional channels, we connected directly with consumers and launched elfcosmetics.com, where the first products sold for $1 each. Our affordable, on-trend offering coupled with our direct approach resonated with young, diverse makeup enthusiasts, who became loyal e.l.f. consumers and helped build the brand through digital engagement and strong word of mouth.
Consumers told us what they did and did not like, as well as what other products they wanted to see from the brand. And we listened. We established deep, genuine connections with our consumers as they informed, inspired and motivated us. We broadened our assortment and expanded our price range up to $6 while staying true to our mission to delight our consumers with luxurious beauty at an extraordinary value.
In 2008, Target, a key beauty destination for many consumers, decided to test e.l.f. in its stores. Once at Target, we brought incremental sales to Target’s cosmetic category and the highest sales per linear foot across the entire cosmetics department. We believe the Target guest appreciated not having to choose between quality and affordable prices, and the e.l.f. cosmetics brand has exhibited strong sales growth in this account ever since. Over the next several years, we nurtured our vibrant community and expanded our distribution to other leading retailers such as Walmart. We gained chain-wide distribution in Target stores in 2013 and in that same year, we opened our first e.l.f. store to add another dimension to the brand experience and further bring our mission of accessible beauty to life.
In January 2014, TPG Growth II Management LLC (“TPG Growth”), a leading global private equity firm, acquired a controlling interest in e.l.f. to further scale and transform the Company. Concurrent with the acquisition, Tarang Amin was appointed as CEO. The objective was to grow the business by enhancing the management team, building the e.l.f. brand, driving industry-leading innovation, expanding distribution and improving operational efficiency.

Over the past four years, we have made significant investments in our business by adding top talent and building our functional capabilities. We have developed strong consumer relationships through our differentiated engagement model; accelerated our first-to-mass innovation capability, including our first category adjacency in skin care; expanded our distribution; and significantly strengthened our operations, including transforming our China team and supplier base to deliver even higher quality. Our efforts have made e.l.f. one of the fastest-growing beauty companies in the United States.
Our strategic differentiation
We are driven by what today’s beauty consumer wants—an assortment of high-quality, prestige-inspired cosmetics and skin care at extraordinary value. We do not define ourselves as strictly mass or prestige, or limit our product availability to select channels. Through our modern consumer engagement and responsive innovation model, we interact with our consumers instead of broadcasting at them. This allows us to stay in tune with their needs and build trust and loyalty. Our business model has multiple areas of competitive advantage.
Authentic brand that attracts some of the best consumers in the category
e.l.f. was founded to fill the gap between high-priced prestige beauty products and less innovative mass products. For over a decade, we have prioritized getting to know our consumers, and they in turn have provided us with valuable feedback, enabling us to address this gap and build e.l.f. into an authentic and trusted brand. By providing a comprehensive experience—from integrated engagement online, through social media and in our stores to our differentiated product offerings—we have drawn a strong following among the most sought after and heaviest users of cosmetic products.
One of our greatest strengths is the consumer that we attract. We appeal to a broad base of beauty consumers from experts to novices who enjoy experimenting with makeup. Many traditional brands have rapidly aging user bases. In contrast, we have strong appeal with Millennials and Hispanics, two of the fastest growing demographic groups in the United States.
Consumer-centric and efficient marketing model
We believe that modern beauty consumers are fundamentally different than generations of consumers before them and are not as engaged by the broad-scale marketing and advertising tactics used by many traditional beauty companies. e.l.f. has deployed a low-cost, consumer-centric marketing model. Total expenses for advertising and promotions in 2017 were $8.1 million, approximately 3% of our net sales.
Our consumers have been our best advocates, growing the e.l.f. brand virally through strong word of mouth. Many are very active in social media, write reviews of our products online and generate content on YouTube and other social media outlets.  Our e-commerce site has over 28 million visitors a year and we possess a social media following on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube that rivals the larger beauty brands. elfcosmetics.com reflects our passionate consumer base with approximately 135,000 ratings. Our digital content—including images, text, and video—inspires our fans with looks and products they love and avoids common industry messaging that beauty is about perfection. We feature e.l.f. consumers as our stars, and reinforce our promise to make luxurious beauty accessible.
High-quality cosmetics and skin care at an extraordinary value enabled by flexible, asset-light operations
e.l.f. consumers recognize our ability to provide a broad assortment of high-quality products at an extraordinary value. The majority of our items retail for $6 or less, providing a low-risk way for consumers to try new products. From formulation to package design, our products deliver quality and innovation at a fraction of prestige prices, facilitating frequent consumer purchasing and experimentation without the guilt of overspending.
All e.l.f. products are hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic. We do not test on animals or endorse such practices, nor do we use ingredients that are tested on animals. We have been designated as being a “cruelty-free” company by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Our products are free from parabens, phthalates, microbeads, and sulfates.
Our portfolio spans the eyes, lips, face, kits, tools and skin care categories.
Fast-cycle innovation and validation model
We believe innovation is key to our success and that we are a leader in the industry in speed and new product introductions. We leverage multiple sources of inspiration to develop our new product ideas, including global trend 
2

assessments, supplier and industry research, strategic customer input and consumer feedback and insights. Our innovation strategy is underpinned by three key pillars to delight consumers:

• | First-to-mass. “First-to-mass” products are inspired by trends in prestige beauty that we bring to the mass market. As consumers are increasingly savvy and knowledgeable about trends in the prestige market, they look for how they can achieve on-trend looks, but at an accessible price. Examples include the e.l.f. Mineral Infused Face Primer at $6 versus a prestige primer at $36, e.l.f. Matte Shadow, Brow, and Liner Palette at $12 versus a prestige palette at $40, the e.l.f. Contouring Brush at $6 versus a similar type of brush at $35 and the e.l.f. Lip Exfoliator at $3 versus a similar type of lip treatment at $24. 


• | Core expansion. Core expansion items are those trend-inspired products across eyes, lips, face and tools that augment our assortment and deliver extraordinary value across price points. We consistently evaluate our core eyes, lips, face and tools offerings and develop new items based on category trends, consumer feedback and other market intelligence. 


• | Adjacencies. We believe that we can reapply our model to launch products into adjacent categories. For example, we entered the skin care category in 2015 with a high-quality skin care product assortment. 

When we launch a new e.l.f. beauty product, we leverage our unique community of digitally engaged consumers. elfcosmetics.com and our e.l.f. branded stores are vehicles for refining products and determining best sellers. We are able to analyze sales results, reviews and feedback through social media to provide a quick indication of a product’s performance. We use this valuable data to introduce validated, best-selling products to retail, which drives leading performance relative to others in the category.
Unlike many beauty companies that launch products in concert with the timing of when retailers rearrange or restock products, we leverage our multi-channel model to launch products throughout the year and test them online and in e.l.f. stores.
True multi-channel brand blurs the lines between mass and prestige
We are a true multi-channel brand with strength across e-commerce, national retailers and our e.l.f. stores. Our ability to engage our consumers across multiple touch points differentiates e.l.f. from traditional mass brands, which typically focus on one channel. We also leverage insights gained from each channel to drive performance across the business.

• | e-commerce. Our e-commerce business serves as a strong source of sales and an important component of our engagement and innovation model. We have nurtured a loyal, highly active online community for over a decade. Our foundation as an e-commerce company and our digital engagement model drive conversion on elfcosmetics.com, where we sell our full product offering. 


• | National retailers. We currently sell our products in the United States in the mass, drug store, food, and specialty retail channels. We are one of the fastest growing cosmetics brands at Target and Walmart. 


• | e.l.f. stores. We were the first mass cosmetics brand with our own stores, a format historically limited to prestige brands. We believe our stores serve as one of our most effective and efficient vehicles for marketing and consumer engagement. 


• | International. e.l.f. products are sold in a number of international markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. 

High-performance team and culture
We have assembled a world-class management team that possesses an excellent track record of results and has successfully worked together for many years. During the team’s prior tenure at Schiff Nutrition (NYSE: SHF), the company grew in enterprise value from $190 million to $1.5 billion in less than two years and was acquired by Reckitt Benckiser (London Stock Exchange: RB). With strong backgrounds from The Clorox Company, The Procter & Gamble Company, The Estee Lauder Companies, Mary Kay, TPG Growth and other leading companies, our team has demonstrated skills in building brands, leading innovation, expanding distribution, making acquisitions and driving world-class operations. We operate with a high-performance team culture.

Markets and competition
The cosmetics category primarily consists of face makeup, eye makeup, lip products, nail products and cosmetics sets/kits and excludes beauty tools and accessories such as brushes and applicators. Cosmetics are broadly sold through food, drug and mass channels, as well as through department stores and direct and specialty channels. The cosmetics industry is relatively concentrated. A significant portion of cosmetics retail sales in the United States are generated by brands owned by L’Oreal S.A., The Estee Lauder Companies Inc., Revlon Inc., Coty Inc., and Shiseido Company, Limited. These large multinational companies own many brands across mass and prestige cosmetics and e.l.f. is one of a small number of brands that is independent. In addition to the traditional brands against which we compete, small independent companies continue to enter the market with new brands and customized product offerings.
Operations
We have developed a scalable, asset-light supply chain centered on speed to market and high-quality at low cost. Our China-based sourcing, quality and innovation teams work with their U.S.-based counterparts to deliver ongoing product quality, innovation and cost savings.
Manufacturing process
Our manufacturing process centers on close collaboration with a network of third-party manufacturers in China and, more recently, the United States. We believe what differentiates us is our ability to drive speed, quality and efficient production. We leverage high annual unit volumes with our suppliers to have them quickly produce small quantities of a new product so that we can launch online in as few as 13 weeks from concept and 22 weeks on average. These early sales provide us with validation data to determine which products to introduce at our national retail customers. Based on what we decide to scale up, we can provide higher, more reliable, longer-term volumes to our manufacturers.
We have transformed our team and supply network to drive even higher quality, while keeping our flexible and low-cost structure. We have ample manufacturing capacity as well as redundant capability in the event that one or more suppliers cannot meet our needs. Our broad supply base gives us the ability to fulfill our product requirements and remain cost competitive.
Ingredients and packaging
We work closely with our suppliers on new product innovation and quality. Our innovation team creates our formulas and our suppliers produce to our specifications. We are not overly dependent on any single formula raw material. These raw materials are broadly available and have regular quality testing for ingredient integrity.
e.l.f. team members create our component and secondary packaging specifications and source their production. We have multiple component and packaging suppliers in place with ample back-up capacity. Our co-packers purchase from our packaging suppliers at our pre-negotiated specifications and rates. This allows us to efficiently manage our packaging quality, capacity and cost.
Quality control
We have a comprehensive quality assurance program that gives us visibility into the quality of our products during the sourcing and production cycle. Our innovation team approves product samples and is on-site for initial production runs of new products. Our quality team provides oversight through on-site inspections and audits of our third-party manufacturers as well as component and packaging suppliers. We periodically conduct comprehensive audits of all our suppliers and have an on-site scheduled presence at our primary suppliers, where we inspect and monitor finished and semi-finished product, raw materials, batch records and testing records. We also validate our manufacturers’ finished product testing results with third-party laboratory testing. In the spirit of continual improvement, we have frequent dialogue with our suppliers on quality assurance enhancements.
Warehousing, distribution and logistics
In early 2016, we opened a new distribution center in Ontario, California, to replace our previous distribution center in New Jersey. This facility supports multi-channel shipping, with the ability to pick and ship directly to e-commerce consumers, e.l.f. stores, national retail customers and international customers. We have also invested capital in scanning and conveying technology. Our facility is operated by a leading third-party logistics provider. Additionally, we utilize third-party logistics providers in Canada and the United Kingdom to distribute to certain international customers.

Seasonality
Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters typically being higher than in the first and second fiscal quarters. The higher net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters are largely attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday season, and adverse events that occur during the third or fourth quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. As a result of higher sales during the third and fourth quarters, we are required to make investments in working capital during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. For more information regarding our working capital requirements see Item 7 “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources.” Fluctuations throughout the year are also driven by the timing of product restocking or rearrangement by our major customers as well as our expansion into new customers. Because a limited number of our retail customers account for a large percentage of our net sales, a change in the order pattern of one or more of our large retail customers could cause a significant fluctuation of our quarterly results or reduce our liquidity. For more information regarding customer concentration see Item 7 “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “Overview.”
Management information systems
We use our information systems to manage our national retailers, e.l.f. stores, e-commerce and corporate operations. These management information systems provide business process support and intelligence across our multi-channel operations.
Our information system infrastructure employs a comprehensive enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) platform provided and supported by a leading global software partner. This system covers order entry, customer service, accounts payable, accounts receivable, purchasing, asset management and manufacturing.
Our order management process is automated via electronic data interchange with the vast majority of our retail customers feeding orders directly to our ERP platform. From time to time, we enhance and complement the system with additional software. We have an integrated warehouse management system managed by our third-party logistics provider, which allows us to improve real-time tracking and management of inventory. We have also implemented computerized point-of-sale systems in our e.l.f. stores to enable real-time reporting and analytics.
Trademarks and other intellectual property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “e.l.f.,” “eyes lips face” and “play beautifully,” all of which are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our goods and services of primary interest. These trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, Russia and approximately 25 other countries or registries. We also have numerous other trademark registrations and pending applications for product names and tag lines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand and our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. The current registrations of these trademarks in the United States and foreign countries are effective for consecutive terms of 10 to 15 years and are due for periodic renewals, presently scheduled between 2018 and 2032, provided that we comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of trademarks in connection with the listed goods or services. In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous URL designations, including elfcosmetics.com. We also rely on and use reasonable business activities to protect unpatented proprietary expertise and product formulations, continuing innovation and other know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 262 full-time employees and 151 part-time and seasonal employees. As of December 31, 2017, we had 199 and 63 full-time employees in the United States and China, respectively. The majority of our part-time employees worked in our e.l.f. stores. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government regulation
We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) as well as various other federal, state, 
5

local and foreign regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of our products.
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), cosmetics are defined as articles or components of articles that are applied to the human body and intended to cleanse, beautify or alter its appearance, with the exception of soap. The labeling of cosmetic products is also subject to the requirements of the FDCA, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and other FDA regulations. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, however certain ingredients, such as color additives, must be pre-authorized. If safety of the products or ingredients has not been adequately substantiated, a specific warning label is required. Other warnings may also be mandated pursuant to FDA regulations. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products neither contain false nor misleading labeling and that they are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions. Inspections also may arise from consumer or competitor complaints filed with the FDA. In the event the FDA identifies false or misleading labeling or unsanitary conditions or otherwise a failure to comply with FDA requirements, we may be required by a regulatory authority or we may independently decide to conduct a recall or market withdrawal of our product or to make changes to our manufacturing processes or product formulations or labels, which could result in an insufficient amount of our products in the market and harm our reputation.
The FDA evaluates the “intended use” of a product to determine whether it is a drug, cosmetic product, or both. If a product is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of a disease condition or to affect the structure or function of the human body, the FDA will regulate the product as a drug. Drug products will then be subject to applicable requirements under the FDCA. The FDA may also consider labeling claims in determining the intended use of a product. If the FDA considers label claims for our cosmetic products to be claims affecting the structure or function of the human body, or intended for a disease condition, those products may be regulated as “new” drugs. If such products were regulated as “new” drugs by the FDA, it would be necessary to obtain pre-market approval, which includes, among other things, conducting clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our products in order to continue marketing those products. However, we may not have sufficient resources to conduct any required clinical studies and because clinical trial outcomes are uncertain we may not be able to demonstrate sufficient efficacy or safety data to resume future marketing of those products.
Our current products that are intended to treat acne and used as sunscreen, including skin care products with SPF, are considered over-the-counter (“OTC”) drug products by the FDA. Our OTC products are subject to regulation through the FDA’s “monograph” system which specifies, among other things, permitted active drug ingredients and their concentrations. The FDA’s monograph system also provides the permissible product claims and certain product labeling requirements, based on the intended use of the product. Our OTC drug products must be manufactured consistent with the FDA’s current drug good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) requirements, and the failure to maintain compliance with these requirements could result in import holds or require us to conduct recalls, market withdrawal or make changes to our manufacturing practices. Any of these actions could result in harm to our reputation or affect our ability to provide sufficient product to the market.
The FDA may change the regulations as to any product category, requiring a change in labeling, product formulation or analytical testing. However, we may not have sufficient resources to conduct any required analytical testing, reformulate the product or make required label changes, possibly resulting in an inability to continue or resume marketing these products. Any inquiries or investigations from the FDA, FTC or other foreign regulatory authorities into the regulatory status of our cosmetic products and any subsequent interruption in the marketing and sale of those products could severely damage our brand and company reputation in the marketplace.
We are subject to regulation by the CPSC under the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations and standards. The CPSC has the authority to require the recall, repair, replacement or refund of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. CPSC regulations also require manufacturers of consumer products to report to the CPSC certain types of information regarding products that fail to comply with applicable regulations. Certain state laws also address the safety of consumer products and mandate reporting requirements, and noncompliance may result in penalties or other regulatory action.
The FTC, FDA and other government authorities also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the safety, performance and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require a safety assessment of the 
6

product and reasonable basis to support any marketing claims. What constitutes a reasonable basis for substantiation can vary widely from market to market, and there is no assurance that our efforts to support our claims will be considered sufficient. A significant area of risk for such activities relates to improper or unsubstantiated claims about the use and safety of our products. If we cannot adequately support safety or substantiate our product claims, or if our promotional materials make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for the classification of the specific product, the FDA, FTC or other regulatory authority could take enforcement action or impose penalties, such as monetary consumer redress, requiring us to revise our marketing materials, amend our claims or stop selling certain products, all of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are also subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. 
There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy and data protection which could affect us. For example, in the European Union, the current data protection laws will be replaced by the new General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which was adopted May 2016 and will become effective in May 2018. The GDPR will implement more stringent operational requirements for controllers of personal data such as us, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements to respond to requests of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification requirements, mandatory contractual provisions for agreements with certain data processors, and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of certain data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. The GDPR also significantly increases penalties for non-compliance; if our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. 
Furthermore, a draft of the new ePrivacy Regulation was announced in January 2017. While it was originally intended to become effective alongside the GDPR, the current draft is still going through the European Union’s legislative process. The new ePrivacy Regulation will replace the current European electronic e-privacy and marketing rules, and when implemented, it is expected to alter rules on direct marketing, and technology for online behavioral advertising and to impose stricter requirements on companies using these tools. These restrictions may affect our ability to promote our products or reach new consumers. Like the GDPR, the current draft of the ePrivacy Regulation can impose fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher). The interpretation and application of both the GDPR and the ePrivacy Regulation will remain uncertain until both have become effective and regulators begin issuing guidance and enforcing the new rules.
Environmental, health and safety
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent regulatory changes occur 
7

in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to the Company. For example, certain states such as California and the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation relating to chemical disclosure and other requirements related to the content of our products.
