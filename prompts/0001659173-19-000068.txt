Jialijia Group Corporation Limited, formerly known as Rizzen, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 21, 2015 and has been inactive since our change in control reported on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on December 30, 2016 (the “Change of Control”). Our prior business model was to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in China and to distribute electronic kid toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors. Under this prior business model, we intended on selling, importing, and marketing our business to European and North American markets.
 
Following the Change of Control, the Company has been seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified. Consequently, the Company now has only minimal assets and liabilities. Its operations are focused on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential. From and after the change of control, unless and until the Company completes an acquisition, its expenses are expected to consist solely of legal, accounting and compliance costs, including those related to complying with reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
 
We are now considered a blank check company. The SEC defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), we also qualify as a “shell company,” because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
Our current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company. In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute or sell assets to the Company rather than to merge. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company. We seek to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary markets.
 
A business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and Board. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if the Company does enter into such a business combination, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.
 
On May 16, 2018, pursuant to the approval of the majority of our shareholders and our board of directors (the “Board”), the Company's Articles of Incorporation were amended to reflect a name change to Jialijia Group Corporation Limited and the number of shares the corporation is authorized to issue increased from 75,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. These changes were effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada.

On December 15, 2018, the Company entered into an asset reorganization agreement (the “Original Reorganization Agreement”) with Shenzhen Wenchuan Industrial Corporation, Ltd. (“Shenzhen Wenchuan”) and Hunan Rucheng Wenchuan Gas Corporation, Ltd. (“Hunan Rucheng”), which was amended by an amendment (the “Amendment”) entered into by both parties on January 9, 2019 (together, the “Reorganization Agreement (As Amended)”), pursuant to which, among other matters, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Reorganization Agreement (As Amended), the Company shall purchase 70% of the equity capital of each of Shenzhen Wenchuan and Hunan Rucheng by paying to Shenzhen Wenchuan and Hunan Rucheng in the aggregate RMB 12,000,000 (approximately $1,789,149) in cash and 24,340,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Shenzhen Wenchuan is the wholly owned parent of Hunan Rucheng. The respective boards of directors of the Company and Wenchuan have each unanimously approved the Original Reorganization Agreement and the Amendment. The transaction underlying the Reorganization Agreement (As Amended) is subject to customary closing conditions, such as shareholder approval and receipt of required regulatory approvals.
