ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of the Business of Acquired Sales Corp.
 
Acquired Sales Corp. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Acquired Sales”, the “Company”, “AQSP”, “Acquired”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986. 
Termination of Letter of Intent to Acquire Sports 1 Marketing Corp., Processing for a Cause Inc. and a Related Management Company
 
On March 1, 2017, Aggregated Marketing Platform Inc. ("AMP"), Processing for a Cause Inc. ("PFAC"), and Sports 1 Marketing  ("S1M") terminated the letter of intent dated June 22, 2016 ("LOI") to be acquired by Acquired Sales.
 
Previously, on June 23, 2016, Acquired Sales had announced that it had signed the LOI to acquire AMP and PFAC, and a related entity. The LOI was filed as Exhibit 10.33 to an 8-K current report filed with the SEC on June 23, 2016. The June 23, 2016 8-K indicated that "[c]losing of the acquisitions is subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of mutually acceptable due diligence, delivery of audited financial statements, completion of a capital raise of at least $4.5 million, execution of definitive acquisition documents, obtaining necessary third party approvals, and completion of all necessary securities filings.” Despite diligent efforts, Acquired Sales was unable to complete a capital raise of $4.5 million. Accordingly, AMP, PFAC and S1M stated in a letter dated March 1, 2017 that they were terminating the LOI pursuant to Paragraph 17 on the basis that they had not received the consideration contemplated in the LOI.
 
One-Seven, LLC
 
One-Seven, LLC ("One-Seven") is a business investment firm that hopes to make equity and/or debt investments in privately held and/or publicly traded companies from time to time. On October 9, 2015, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, loaned money to One-Seven. Gerard M. Jacobs obtained a 50% economic interest in One-Seven, and therefore One-Seven is a related party to Gerard M. Jacobs. On November 4, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement with One-Seven, its Managing Partner Douglas Stukel ("Stukel"), and Gerard M. Jacobs pursuant to which the Company loaned $50,000 interest-free to One-Seven. As of December 31, 2015, $25,000 of the loan had been repaid to the Company by One-Seven, and the balance of $25,000 was still held by the Company as a receivable from One-Seven. The loan was repaid in full as of January 5, 2016. In consideration of such $50,000 loan to One-Seven, One-Seven and Stukel agreed that if One-Seven is successful in securing additional funding, then Stukel and One-Seven are obligated to use good faith efforts to work with Gerard M. Jacobs and the Company, as a team and not as a partnership, joint venture or other entity, in order to explore and hopefully close transactions pursuant to which: (a) One-Seven may provide debt, convertible debt and/or equity to the Company, all on mutually acceptable terms and conditions; (b) One-Seven may provide debt, convertible debt and/or equity to business entities that may be wholly or partly purchased by, or merged into, the Company, all on mutually acceptable terms and conditions; and (c) Stukel may participate in the management of the Company and obtain a salary and a package of stock options and/or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, all on mutually acceptable terms and conditions.
 
There are no assurances or guarantees whatsoever that the Company will consummate any transactions involving One-Seven or Mr. Stukel.
 
Industrial Services Industry
 
We do not have, and do not expect to have in the foreseeable future, any industrial services sector operations. However, on December 2, 2014, we announced the signing of a letter of intent to acquire an entity called PPV, Inc. (“PPV”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Bravo Environmental, NW, Inc. (“Bravo”). On February 5, 2015, we also announced the signing of another letter of intent to acquire a related company, River Country Transport, Inc. (“RCT”). Both proposed acquisitions were subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of mutually acceptable due diligence. During the due diligence process, we evaluated information regarding the potential risks and benefits of acquiring PPV, Bravo and RCT. After discussions and negotiations with PPV, Bravo and RCT, we were unable to resolve certain concerns/issues to our satisfaction. As a result, on March 11, 2015, we terminated our letters of intent with PPV and RCT. 
Previous Subsidiaries
 
Previously, the Company was involved in selling software licenses and hardware, and the provision of consulting and maintenance services. Please refer to the Company’s past filings for information related to the acquisitions and sales of Defense & Security Technology Group, Inc. (“DSTG”) and Cogility Software Corporation (“Cogility”). The sale of Cogility and DSTG eliminated the Company’s sources of revenue.
Acquisition Process

3

The structure of our participation in business opportunities and ventures will continue to be situational. We may structure future acquisitions as an asset purchase, merger, or an acquisition of securities. It is likely that the anticipated value of the business and/or assets that we acquire relative to the current value of our securities will result in the issuance of a relatively large number of shares and, as a result, substantial additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our current stockholders. Moreover, our present management and shareholders may not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a business acquisition or other reorganization transaction. It is possible that the shareholders of the acquired entity will gain control of our voting stock and our directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the shareholders. Those directors are entitled to replace our officers without stockholder vote.
 
In regard to nearly all of our potential acquisitions, we are typically focused upon acquiring existing privately held businesses whose owners are willing to consider merging their businesses into our Company in order to establish a public trading market for their common stock, and whose management teams are willing to operate the acquired businesses as divisions or subsidiaries of our Company. 
 
Closing such potential acquisitions will likely require to raise millions of dollars of capital, in order to pay the cash portion of the acquisition consideration and in some cases in order to make an injection of cash into the businesses being acquired. We can provide no assurance or guaranty whatsoever that we will be able to raise such millions of dollars of capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. No party has committed to provide such capital to us. 
 
Our Chief Executive Officer will review material furnished to him by the proposed merger or acquisition candidates and will ultimately decide if a merger or acquisition is in our best interests and the interests of our shareholders. We intend to source business opportunities through our Chief Executive Officer and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities and ventures may become available to it due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) management’s willingness to consider a wide variety of businesses; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and directors. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities and ventures, we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by our management, such potential business opportunities or ventures by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.
 
In a due diligence investigation, we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our Chief Executive Officer or agents to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding our prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target business to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.
 
There is no guarantee that we can obtain or maintain the funding needed for our operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services.
 
As of August 31, 2018, we have cash on hand of approximately $0, which is less than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured limit of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. In prior years, our payables have been greater than our cash on hand. We have inconsistent income generating ability and are therefore reliant on raising money from loans or stock sales.
 
Offices
 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 31 N. Suffolk Lane, Lake Forest, Illinois 60045. We currently do not have a dedicated corporate office for our Company; however, in the past, our subsidiaries have maintained offices. There are no agreements or understandings with respect to any office facility subsequent to the completion of an acquisition. We may relocate our corporate headquarters in connection with a change in the management of our Company, or in connection with the completion of a merger or acquisition.
Employees
 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, runs our operations on a part-time basis and is compensated with equity; see Item 11 “Executive Compensation”. Mr. Jacobs has not historically received cash compensation or salary deferral, but may receive cash salary in the future. We currently employ one part-time independent contractor, William C. Jacobs, CPA, who is the son of

our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, at the rate of $5,000 per month, plus expenses. We currently have no full-time employees.
    In the future, we may engage full-time employees with full-time salaries appropriate to the nature and scope of our future business operations. We expect to continue to use attorneys, accountants and independent contractors as necessary.
