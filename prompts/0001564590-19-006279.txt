Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General Development and Narrative Description of Business 
 Retail Value Inc. is an Ohio corporation (the “Company” or “RVI”) formed in December 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, RVI did not conduct any business and did not have any material assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, RVI owned and operated a portfolio of 38 assets, composed of 26 continental United States assets and 12 assets in Puerto Rico.  As of December 31, 2018, these properties consisted of retail shopping centers composed of 14 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) located in 15 states and Puerto Rico.  The Company is a self-administered and self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”).  The Company’s continental U.S. assets comprised 64% and the properties in Puerto Rico comprised 36% of its total combined revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.  RVI’s centers have a diverse tenant base that includes national retailers such as Walmart/Sam’s Club, the TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods), Bed, Bath & Beyond, PetSmart, Kohl’s, Best Buy, Gap, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Ross Stores.  Prior to July 1, 2018, RVI was a consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary of SITE Centers Corp. (“SITE Centers”) and was presented on a carve-out basis in accordance with the guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 The Company focuses on realizing value in its business through operations and sales of its assets, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for operating expenses, repayment of indebtedness and distributions to the Company’s preferred and common shareholders.  The Company is externally managed and advised by one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of SITE Centers (collectively with such wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Manager”), a self-administered and self-managed REIT in the business of acquiring, owning, developing, redeveloping, expanding, leasing, financing and managing shopping centers and the Company’s parent prior to its spin-off into a separate, publicly traded company on July 1, 2018.  In February 2018, the Company and the Manager entered into three amended and restated management and leasing agreements for the provision of property management services for (a) properties held in the continental United States directly by the Company, (b) properties held in the continental United States by a taxable REIT subsidiary (a “TRS”) of the Company and (c) properties held in Puerto Rico (together, the “Property Management Agreements”).  In addition, on July 1, 2018, the Company and the Manager entered into a corporate management agreement (the “External Management Agreement” and, collectively with the Property Management Agreements, the “Management Agreements”) pursuant to which the Manager provides corporate management services to the Company.
 The Company expects to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2018, and intends to maintain its status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes in future periods.  The Company holds a number of properties indirectly through a TRS.  Income from operations and gains from the sale of property by a TRS are subject to tax at the TRS level at corporate tax rates.  The current U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is 21%.
 Recent Developments
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for information on certain recent developments of the Company, which is incorporated herein by reference to such information.  
Retail Environment 
 The Company continues to see steady demand from a broad range of tenants for its continental U.S. space, even as many tenants continue to adapt to an omni-channel retail environment. Value-oriented tenants continue to take market share from conventional and national chain department stores. New demand for space at the Company’s Puerto Rico properties is more limited, especially with respect to big box and national tenants.  
 The Company leased approximately 1.8 million square feet of GLA, or 63 new leases and 117 renewals, for a total of 180 leases executed in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company had 180 leases expiring in 2019 with an average base rent per square foot of $22.06.

The following table summarizes the portfolio’s leased rate and leasing spreads for the comparable leases executed for the periods presented as well as the weighted average cost of tenant improvements and lease costs: 
 
 
 | Full Year 2018 | 
--------------------+------------------+-----
 | Continental U.S. | | | Puerto Rico | | Total
Leased Rate(1) | | | | | | | | | 
Beginning of period | | 93.6 | % | | 89.6 | % | | 92.5 | % 
End of period | | 92.9 | % | | 87.0 | % | | 91.0 | % 
Leasing spreads | | | | | | | | | 
Blended all leases | | 1.2 | % | | 0.4 | % | | 1.0 | % 
New leases | | (4.7 | %) | | — | | | (4.7 | %)
Renewal leases | | 2.1 | % | | 2.5 | % | | 2.2 | % 
Lease costs | | | | | | | | | 
New leases(2) | | | | | | | $ | 7.53 | 
Renewal leases(3) | N/A | | | N/A | | N/A 


(1) | The 2018 end of period leased rate was impacted by the bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us, anchor store expirations, lower occupancy rates within the Puerto Rico portfolio as well as the Company’s disposition of 12 continental U.S. assets in 2018 that had leased rates in excess of the portfolio average.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Represents weighted-average cost of tenant improvements and lease commissions estimated to be incurred over the expected lease term for new leases per rentable square foot. The Company could incur significant costs to execute new leases. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The Company does not generally expend a significant amount of capital on lease renewals.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company’s leasing spread calculation includes only those deals that were executed within one year of the date the prior tenant vacated and, as a result, is a good benchmark to compare the average annualized base rent of expiring leases with the comparable executed market rental rates. The continental U.S. new lease spreads of negative 4.7% was impacted by the retenanting of one dark, anchor space with an expiration of February 2019.  Excluding this unit, new leasing spreads would have been 8.3%.  The Company expects leasing spreads for the continental U.S. portfolio on a blended basis to range from flat to slightly positive depending upon the impact of certain anchor renewals.  Leasing volumes in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria remain low in a historical context. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Puerto Rico portfolio of comparable leases included only three new leases for approximately 2,200 square feet (out of 4.4 million square feet of gross leasable area).  Due to the limited pool size, the spreads were excluded from the table above.  Given current limited demand and a challenging economic backdrop in Puerto Rico, the Company has been signing a limited number of short-term leases. Although the Company currently expects a gradual recovery and normalization of leasing demand, volumes, and economics in Puerto Rico, for 2019, the Company expects spreads for that portfolio to range from slightly positive to negative with an overall negative average.  The Company’s overall total reported leasing spreads could vary from quarter to quarter depending upon both the volume and size of leases executed in each period, particularly as the size of the portfolio gets smaller due to asset sales.

 Competition 
 Numerous real estate companies and developers, private and public, compete with the Company in leasing space in shopping centers to tenants. The Company competes with other real estate companies and developers in terms of rental rate, property location, availability of other space and maintenance. 
Insurance 
 The Company has comprehensive liability, casualty, flood, terrorism and rental loss insurance policies on its properties. The Company believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, the Company’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover its losses. For additional information, please refer to the discussion in this section, “Risk Factors.”
Governmental Regulations 
 The Company’s business is subject to numerous governmental regulations, including regulations relating to the ownership of real estate, environmental law, regulations governing REITs and others. For additional information, please refer to the discussion in this section, “Risk Factors.”

Compliance with Environmental Laws 
 As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various federal, state, territorial and local laws, ordinances and regulations. See the detailed discussion of these and other risks related to environmental matters in “Risk Factors— The Company’s Real Estate Investments May Contain Environmental Risks That Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust
 The Company intends to make an election on its first tax return to qualify, and believes it is operating so as to qualify, as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that it makes distributions to its shareholders equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as defined under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and continues to satisfy certain other requirements.  As a result, the Company, with the exception of its TRS, is not subject to federal income tax to the extent it meets certain requirements of the Code.  
Employees 
 The Company is managed by the Manager pursuant to the Management Agreements. All of the Company’s executive officers are employees of the Manager or its affiliates. The Company does not expect to have any employees.

The Company’s Manager
 The Company is externally managed and advised by the Manager pursuant to the Management Agreements. The Company does not have any employees. Instead, pursuant to the terms of the External Management Agreement, the Manager provides the Company with its management team, including a chief executive officer, along with appropriate support personnel, in order to provide the management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company. Accordingly, each of the Company’s executive officers is an executive of SITE Centers. 
 SITE Centers, however, is not obligated to dedicate any of its executives or other personnel exclusively to the Company. In addition, neither SITE Centers nor its executives or other personnel, including its executive officers supplied to the Company, are obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to the Company. The External Management Agreement requires only that members of the Company’s management team devote such time as is necessary and appropriate, commensurate with the level of the Company’s activity. Nevertheless, the Company believes it benefits from the personnel, relationships and experience of SITE Centers’ executive team. 
 The Management Agreements were negotiated between related parties, and although the Company believes the terms are reasonable and approximate terms of an arm’s-length transaction, their terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to the Company as if they had been negotiated at arm’s length with an unaffiliated third party. However, the Manager is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of the Board of Directors and has only such functions, responsibilities and authority as are specified in the Management Agreements. 
 For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company’s Relationship with SITE Centers and the Manager” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Manager” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
