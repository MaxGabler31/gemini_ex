ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History and Organization
We are a mining and minerals production and exploration company focused on precious and base metals in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Colorado in 1979. We own 100% of the Black Fox mine and Stock mill in Ontario, Canada, a 100% interest in the Gold Bar mine in Nevada, 100% of the formerly-producing El Gallo Project in Sinaloa, Mexico, 81.4% of McEwen Copper, the owner of the Los Azules copper deposit in San Juan, Argentina, and a 49% interest in MSC, the owner and operator of the San José mine in Santa Cruz, Argentina. MSC is controlled by the majority owner of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc (“Hochschild”). Since we own less than a 50% interest in MSC, we account for our interest as an unconsolidated subsidiary using the equity method of accounting. In addition to our operating properties, we hold interests in advanced-stage and exploration-stage properties and projects in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, including the Los Azules copper project (“Los Azules”) in Argentina. 
Our commencement of Canadian operations in 2017 was facilitated by the acquisition of Lexam VG Gold Inc. (“Lexam”) in April 2017 and the acquisition of the Black Fox mine and Stock mill in October 2017. These two acquisitions provided us with an operating mine, mill and significant land interests in the historic Timmins mining district of Ontario. On September 19, 2021, the Froome deposit at the Black Fox mine achieved commercial production.
Our 100% owned Gold Bar mine in Nevada poured its first gold ingot on February 16, 2019 and achieved commercial production on May 23, 2019. Construction activities started in late 2017 following the receipt of the final permit on November 8, 2017. At the El Gallo Project, mining and crushing activities ceased during the second quarter of 2018, with production activities since that time limited to residual leaching.
During 2021, we re-organized our subsidiary, McEwen Copper Inc. (“McEwen Copper”), through which we historically held an indirect 100% interest in the Los Azules copper project in the province of San Juan, Argentina and Nevada Creek property. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we closed the first tranche of a private placement, a $40 million investment by an affiliate of our Chairman and CEO, Rob McEwen, in exchange for a 18.6% interest in McEwen Copper. McEwen Copper is included for the period August 19 to December 31, 2021, which is reported at 81.4% non-controlling interest. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 Non-Controlling Interests.
Our objective is to increase shareholder value through the exploration for and economic extraction of gold, silver and other valuable minerals. Other than the San José mine in Argentina, we generally conduct our activities as the sole operator, but we may enter into arrangements with other companies through joint venture or similar agreements in an effort to achieve our strategic objectives. We hold our mineral property interests and operate our business through various subsidiary companies, each of which is owned directly, or indirectly, by us.
Our principal executive office is located at 150 King Street West, Suite 2800, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 1J9 and our telephone number is (866) 441-0690. We also maintain offices in Elko, Nevada (U.S.), Matheson, Canada, Guamuchil, Mexico, and San Juan, Argentina. Our website is www.mcewenmining.com. We make available at no cost our periodic reports including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and news releases and certain of our corporate governance documents, including our Code of Ethics, on our website. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “MUX.” 
In this report, unless otherwise noted, “Au” represents gold; “Ag” represents silver; “Cu” represents copper, “oz” represents troy ounce; “gpt” represents grams per metric tonne; “ft.” represents feet; “m” represents meter; “sq.” represents square, and C$ refers to Canadian dollars.

Segment Information
Our operating segments include USA, Canada, Mexico, MSC and Los Azules. Financial information for each of our reportable segments can be found under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, Operating Segment Reporting. 
Products
The end product at our gold and silver operations is either in the form of doré or concentrate. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold and silver but also containing other impurity metals. Doré is sent to third party refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold and 99.9% silver. Ore concentrate, or simply concentrate, is raw mineralized material that has been ground finely to a powdery product from which gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. Concentrate, as well as slag and fine carbons (by-products of the gold production process), are sent to third party smelters for further recovery of gold and silver.
​
During 2021, production consisted of 100% doré from the Gold Bar mine, 99% doré and 1% slag and fine carbon from the Black Fox mine was and approximately 92% doré and 8% slag and fine carbon from the El Gallo Project. Production from the San José mine consisted of approximately 40% doré and 60% concentrate. 
​
During 2021, we reported the following consolidated production attributable to us:

(1) | Calculated using an average silver to gold ratio of 72:1 at the 100% owned operations and at the San José mine.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gold and silver bullion obtained from the doré produced in USA, Canada, Mexico and the San José mine are sold at the prevailing spot market price. Concentrates produced by the San José mine are provisionally priced, whereby the selling price is subject to final adjustments at the end of a period ranging from 30 to 90 days after delivery to the customer. The final price is based on the market price at the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract. Due to the time elapsed between shipment and the final settlement with the buyer, MSC estimates the prices at which sales of metals will be settled. At the end of each financial reporting period, previously recorded provisional sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices based on relevant forward market prices until final settlement with the buyer.
During 2021, revenues from gold and silver sales were $79.2 million from the Gold Bar mine, $50.7 million from the Black Fox mine, $6.6 million from the El Gallo Project, and $133.2 million from the San José mine on a 49% basis. Revenue from the San José mine is not included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) as we use the equity method of accounting for MSC. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding production and operating results for our properties, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Investments and Note 9, Investment in Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”) – San José Mine for additional information regarding the equity method of accounting.

On March 4, 2022, the London P.M. Fix for gold was $1,945 per ounce and the London Fix for silver was $25.15 per ounce.
Mineralized Material Processing Methods
Gold and silver are extracted from mineralized material by either milling or heap leaching depending on, among other things, the amount of gold and silver contained in the material, whether the material is naturally oxidized or not, and the amenability of the material to treatment. 
At the Gold Bar mine and the El Gallo Project, both open pit operations, the mineralized material is processed using heap leaching methods. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed, oxidized material on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve and leach the gold and silver. The gold and silver-bearing solution is then collected and processed into doré bars.
At Black Fox, mineralized material from the underground mine is transported to the mill site and fed to the mill’s crushing circuit. Following additional processing and refining, the operation produces doré bars.
At San José, mineralized material from the underground mine is processed at a mill site, producing a concentrate and doré product.
Hedging Activities
Our strategy is to provide shareholders with exposure to gold and silver prices by selling our gold and silver ounces at spot market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold or silver sales. We may, however, from time to time, manage certain risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies using the derivatives market. 
Gold and Silver Reserves
We have established gold and/or silver reserves at two of our properties: Gold Bar and San José. In 2020, through consultations with field experts, we completed work around the Gold Bar mineral reserve to revise the previous estimate. The work included drilling and metallurgical testing, geological and structural modelling and a 110,500 feet (33,700 m) drill program. On January 7, 2021, we announced the updated Indicated Resource and Probable Reserve Estimates of the Gold Bar mine and subsequently filed the 43-101 Technical Report on February 22, 2021.

Footnotes to 2021 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves
Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into a Mineral Reserves estimate. The numbers in the tables have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimates and may not sum due to rounding. The Inferred Mineral Resource in these estimates has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration; Quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to classify these Inferred resources as Measured or Indicated.
UG Mineral Resources include the ‘must take’ minor material below cut-off grade within the mineable shape optimizer stopes that are generated by above-cut-off grade blocks.
The Mineral Resources in this report were estimated and reporting using the regulation S-K 1300 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Fox Complex
Mineral Resources for Froome are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 2.35 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of C$80/t, process cost of C$24.34/t, G&A cost of C$10.50/t, haulage cost of C$4.70/t, refining cost of C$1.82/oz, metallurgical recovery of 87%, royalty buyout of C$1.21/t, dilution of 15%, and realized gold price of US$1,632/oz (after Sandstorm Stream).
Mineral Resources for Grey Fox are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 2.30 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of C$80/t, process cost of C$24.34/t, G&A cost of C$10.50/t, haulage cost of C$5.64/t, refining cost of C$1.82/oz, metallurgical recovery of 85%, royalty NSR of 2.65%, dilution of 15%, and gold price of US$1,725/oz.
Mineral Resources for Stock West are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 1.95 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of C$80/t, process cost of C$24.34/t, G&A cost of C$10.50/t, refining cost of C$1.82/oz, metallurgical recovery of 94%, dilution of 15%, and gold price of US$1,725/oz.
Mineral Resources for Fuller are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 2.30 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of C$90/t, process cost of C$24.55/t, G&A cost of C$10.50/t, haulage cost of C$6.64/t, metallurgical recovery of 88%, 10% Net Profits Interest (NPI) royalty, dilution of 10% and gold price of US$1,725/oz.
Mineral Resources for Stock East are reported above an economic cut-off grade of 1.67 g/t gold assuming underground extraction methods and based on a mining cost of $60.61/t, process cost of $18.60/t, G&A cost of $7.95/t, metallurgical recovery of 94%, and gold price of US$1,725/oz. 
Resources were calculated using a gold price of U$1725 based on industry consensus on long-term metal prices in late 2020. Resources are stated as in-situ. There are no Mineral Reserves stated in 2021 - Black Fox Mine reserves were depleted in 2021 when mining ceased in May. For all properties, a change in commodity price led to a change (generally lower) in the COG used to calculate resources. In addition, the use of UG constraining shapes to better define reasonable prospects for economic extraction were used. Some of the deposits used improvements to modelling and estimation methodology and updates based on drilling results. Black Fox Mine and Froome included changes due to mining depletion.
​
Gold Bar
Mineral reserves equal the total ore planned for processing from the mine plan based on a $1,650/oz gold price. Mineral reserves are based on the following economic input parameters: $3.80/ avg. ore ton mining cost, $2.88/ avg. waste ton mining cost, $4.91/ore ton crushed process cost, $3.77/ore ton ROM process cost, $3.22/ore ton G&A cost, $0.475/oz gold refining charge, $1.538/oz transport & sales cost, 99.95% payable gold, 1% royalty at GBS only.
The stated Reserves are based on a variable cut-off grade based on rock type, mining area, carbon content, clay content and process response. The grades reported from Pick and Ridge include a mining dilution based on the surrounding block grades. Reserves are contained within an engineered pit design between the $1,250/oz and $1,400 gold sales price Lerchs-Grossman pit shells, based on end of December 2021 topography.
Mineral resources are based on the following economic input parameters: $3.19/ore ton mining cost, $1.99/waste ton mining cost, $4.91/ore ton crushed process cost, $3.77/ore ton ROM process cost, $3.16/ore ton G&A cost, $0.475/oz gold refining charge, $1.538/oz transport & sales cost, 99.95% payable gold, 1% royalty at Gold Bar South (GBS) only. Resources stated are contained within a $1,725/oz Gold sales price Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) pits based on end of December 2021 topography
The Metal price used (U$1725) for resources is based on the consensus pricing forecasts based on Q4 2020 data. Resources are reported as in-situ. Recoveries are variable and as follows: 78% crushed oxide recovery at Pick & Ridge, 50% mid-carbon recovery at Pick & Ridge, 72% ROM oxide recovery at Pick & Ridge, 61% ROM oxide recovery at GBS, 0% ROM mid-carbon recovery. Cut-off grades are variable and based on the presence or not of clay content, carbon content and recoveries. 

11



The metal price used (U$1650) for reserves reflects a conservative combination of a recent trailing average sourced from Kitco’s Historic Price data and a consensus forecast via Bloomberg. Recoveries are variable and as follows: 78% crushed oxide recovery at Pick & Ridge, 50% mid-carbon recovery at Pick & Ridge, 72% ROM oxide recovery at Pick & Ridge, 61% ROM oxide recovery at GBS, 0% ROM mid-carbon recovery. Cut-off grades are variable and based on the presence or not of clay content, carbon content and recoveries and range from 0.0065opt to 0.0121opt. The reference point for the Mineral Reserves is at the primary crusher.
​
Changes in Mineral Resources are due to mining depletion during 2021. The following changes have impacted the project Reserves: Mining depletion at Pick; the Gold Price has increased from $1500/toz to $1650/toz; the operating costs increased largely driven by an increase in mining costs; project costs were re-estimated based on current mining activity and new contractor quotes; the schedule has been updated based on the revised metal prices and costs.
​
San Jose
Reported resources and reserves are McEwen’s 49% attributable interest. Hochschild has a 51% interest in San José.
Metal equivalent used AgEq = (Au x 72) + Ag
Resources reporting Cut-off: 240 g/t AgEq; For Reserves AgEq Cut-offs: cut & fill 269 g/t AgEq., long hole 191 g/t AgEq.
Resources are in situ. Reserves as presented are in place and include average internal dilution of 5%, average mining and geotechnical dilution of 46%, and mine extraction of 37%, but do not include allowances for mill or smelter recoveries. For the 2021 Mineral Reserve Estimate, inaccessible Mineral Resources that contained insufficient tonnages to permit the development of local infrastructure, Mineral Resources in mined out/ isolated areas, Mineral Resources located in sill and rib pillars and operationally lost Mineral Resources were not included in the Mineral Reserve Estimate.
Metal prices of U$1800/oz Au and U$26/oz Ag were used for Resources based on a long-term consensus forecast for reserve prices with ~15% increase for resource prices. Metal prices of U$1600/oz Au and U$23/oz Ag were used based on long term consensus forecast for reserve prices. Ongoing definition, delineation and mine exploration drilling leads to better definition of existing resources or extensions of known veins that will be reflected on the year-on-year comparison of both mineral resources and reserves. Mine depletion, commodity price changes and equivalents leading to COG changes will also have an effect on the comparative data.
It should be noted that the San José Mine has a history of increasing Mineral Reserves over time, both from upgrading Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources, and from exploration success. Changes to internal and external dilution and ore loss rates will affect the Reserve balance
​
Los Azules
Mineral Resource is reported inside of a pitshell, the parameters assumed are a copper price of $2.75/lb, operating costs of $1.70/t mining, $5.00/t for processing and $1.00/t for G&A, and Copper metallurgical recovery of 90%. Mineral Resource is reported with a cut-off grade of 0.20% Cu.
Mexico
Gold and Silver Resources were calculated using metal prices of U$1300/oz and U$16/oz respectively. These prices were based off the 3-year trailing average of the London Closing Fix for 2017-2019 ($1306 and $16.32) sourced from Kitco’s Historical Data charts.
​
Resources are stated as in situ for El Gallo Silver and as crushed and stacked ready for hauling and processing at the El Gallo Gold HLP.
​
El Gallo Silver: Milling recovery assumptions of 86% (sulfide) and 75% (oxide) for silver and 86% gold. Mining costs of $1.95/t, processing and G&A costs of $26.15/t milled were used. Resources are stated within an optimized pitshell indicating prospects for eventual economic extraction.

12



​
Heap Leach Pad: Because of the unconsolidated nature of the heap leach material, the mine schedule plans to mine the entire heap without the benefit of selectivity. Sub-cut-off leach pad material will inherently have potential acid generating sulfide liabilities if placed in our waste dumps and so it will be prudent to process the entire leach pad and place tailings in a previously mined pit at an overall environmental and economic benefit.
​
Recovery assumptions of 85% Au and 60% Ag.
​
The differences in annual Resources at El Gallo Gold are attributed to the Heap Leach operation. Residual leaching continued in 2021 and continues into 2022. There was a minor amount of metal recovered (c.3.6koz Au and 7.0koz Ag) at the operation in 2021.
​
Competitive Business Conditions
We compete with many companies in the mining and mineral exploration and production industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel, and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease, or acquisition in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and other areas where we may conduct our mining or exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas that would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources.
Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties, but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such exploration and development. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious and base metals but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in our company not only being unable to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
General Government Regulations
In the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities and concessions granted under contracts with the host government, there are no third-party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. The applicable laws and regulations applicable to us include but are not limited to:

● | mineral concession rights.
--+---------------------------


● | surface rights.
--+----------------


● | water rights.
--+--------------


● | mining royalties.
--+------------------


● | environmental laws.
--+--------------------


● | mining permits.

● | mining and income taxes.
--+-------------------------


● | health and safety laws and regulations.
--+----------------------------------------


● | labor laws and regulations.
--+----------------------------


● | export regulations.
--+--------------------

We believe that all of our properties are operated in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations.

Reclamation Obligations
Under applicable laws in the jurisdictions where our properties are located, we are required to reclaim disturbances caused by our mining activities. Accordingly, we have recorded estimates in our financial statements for our reclamation obligations, in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”) the most significant of which are related to our properties in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Estimated future reclamation costs are based primarily on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2021, we accrued $35.5 million for reclamation costs relating to currently developed and producing properties. These amounts are included in Asset Retirement Obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
U.S. Environmental Laws
We are subject to extensive environmental regulation under the laws of the U.S. and the state of Nevada, where our U.S. operations are conducted. For example, certain mining wastes resulting from the extraction and processing of ores would be considered hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state law equivalents, but we are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste. If our mine wastes were treated as hazardous waste under RCRA or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as “Superfund” sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state law equivalents for cleanup, significant expenditures could be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities, for other remediation expenditures, or for natural resource damages. Under CERCLA, any present or past owners or operators of a Superfund site generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owners or operators may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our operations, tailings, and waste disposal areas, as well as upon mine closure under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including, without limitation, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and state law equivalents. See Note 12 to our consolidation financial statements, Reclamation and Remediation Liabilities, for information on reclamation obligations under governmental environmental laws.
We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Future changes in U.S. federal or state laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon us and our results of operations.
Foreign Government Regulations
Canada, where the Black Fox mine, Stock mill and other exploration and development projects are located, and Mexico, where the El Gallo Project and Fenix Project are located, have both adopted laws and guidelines for environmental permitting that are similar to those in effect in the U.S. The permitting process requires a thorough study to determine the baseline condition of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of exploration and mining operation activities. We have received all permits required to operate our current activities in Canada and Mexico and have received all permits necessary for the exploration activities being conducted at our non-U.S. properties.
Customers
Production from Gold Bar, Black Fox, and the El Gallo Project is sold as refined metal on the spot market or doré under the terms set out in doré purchase agreements. 
We have doré purchase agreements with Canadian financial institutions, Asahi Refining (“Asahi”), our refiner, and with metals trading companies. Under the terms of our doré purchase agreements, we have the option to sell approximately 90% of the gold and silver contained in doré bars produced at Gold Bar, Black Fox and the El Gallo Project prior to the completion of refining. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 97% of our consolidated sales were made to Asahi, with 38% of the sales made through the doré purchase agreement. 

14



During the year ended December 31, 2021, 92% of the total sales from the San José mine were made to three companies: Aurubis AG, a German company, accounted for 15% of the total sales, LS Nikko, a Korean Company, accounted for 35% of the total sales and Argo-Heraeus, a Swiss company, accounted for 42% of the total sales. MSC has sales agreements with each of these purchasers.
