ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Spirit Airlines, Inc. ("Spirit Airlines"), headquartered in Miramar, Florida, offers affordable travel to value-conscious customers. Our all-Airbus fleet is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States. We serve 85 destinations in 16 countries throughout the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Our stock trades under the symbol "SAVE" on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). 
Our ultra low-cost carrier, or ULCC, business model allows us to compete principally by offering customers unbundled base fares that remove components traditionally included in the price of an airline ticket. By offering customers unbundled base fares, we give customers the power to save by paying only for the Á La SmarteTM options they choose, such as checked and carry-on bags, advance seat assignments, priority boarding and refreshments. We record revenue related to these options as non-fare passenger revenue, which is recorded within passenger revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. 
Our History
We were founded in 1964 as Clippert Trucking Company, a Michigan corporation. We began air charter operations in 1990 and renamed ourselves Spirit Airlines, Inc. in 1992. In 1994, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in 1999 we relocated our headquarters to Miramar, Florida.

Changes to Our Corporate Structure
In August 2020, Spirit Airlines formed several new subsidiaries; Spirit Finance Cayman 1 Ltd. (“HoldCo 1”), Spirit Finance Cayman 2 Ltd. (“HoldCo 2), Spirit IP Cayman Ltd. (“Spirit IP”) and Spirit Loyalty Cayman Ltd. (“Spirit Loyalty”). Each are Cayman Islands exempted companies incorporated with limited liability. Spirit IP and Spirit Loyalty are wholly-owned subsidiaries of HoldCo 2 (other than the special share issued to the special shareholder, who granted a proxy to vote such share to the collateral agent for the 8.00% senior secured notes (as defined herein)). HoldCo 1 and HoldCo 2 are special purpose holding companies. HoldCo 2 is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of HoldCo 1 (other than the special share issued to the special shareholder, who granted a proxy to vote such share to the collateral agent for the 8.00% senior secured notes). HoldCo 1 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirit Airlines (other than the special share issued to the special shareholder, who granted a proxy to vote such share to the collateral agent for the 8.00% senior secured notes). 
Recent Developments
On February 5, 2022, Spirit Airlines entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Frontier Group Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Frontier”), and Top Gun Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Frontier (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Spirit Airlines, with Spirit Airlines continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each existing share of Spirit Airlines’ common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) $2.13 in cash, without interest and (ii) 1.9126 shares of Frontier’s common stock (“Frontier Common Stock”), par value $0.001 per share. Upon consummation of the Merger, existing shareholders of Spirit Airlines will own approximately 48.5% of the outstanding shares of Frontier on a fully diluted basis.
Completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including, among other things, (1) approval of the transactions by Spirit Airlines’ stockholders, (2) receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, including 
approvals from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the expiration or early termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other required regulatory approvals; (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions; (4) the effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed by Frontier and Spirit Airlines with the SEC pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (5) the authorization and approval for listing on NASDAQ of the shares of Frontier Common Stock to be issued to holders of Spirit Airlines’ common stock in the Merger; and (6) the absence of any material adverse effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on either Spirit Airlines or Frontier.
The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for Spirit Airlines and Frontier, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the Merger is not consummated on or before February 5, 2023, subject to certain extensions if needed to obtain regulatory approvals. Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Spirit Airlines will be required to pay Frontier a breakup fee of $94.2 million. The Merger Agreement also provides the methodology by which certain expenses will be borne.

Our Business Model
Our ULCC business model provides guests low, unbundled base fares with a range of optional services, allowing guests the freedom to choose only the options they value. The success of our model is driven by our low-cost structure, which has 
historically permitted us to offer low base fares while maintaining high profit margins. During 2020 and 2021, we were unable to deliver a profit due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our airline. 
We are focused on value-conscious travelers who pay for their own travel, and our business model is designed to deliver what our guests want: low fares and a great experience. We use low fares to address underserved markets, which helps us to increase passenger volume and load factors on the flights we operate. We also have high-density seating configurations on our aircraft and a simplified onboard product designed to lower costs. High passenger volumes and load factors help us sell more ancillary products and services, which in turn allows us to reduce the base fare we offer even further. We strive to be recognized by our guests and potential guests as the low-fare leader in the markets we serve.
We compete based on total price. We believe that we and our guests benefit when we allow our guests to know the total price of their travel by breaking out the cost of optional products or services. We allow our guests to see all available options and their respective prices prior to purchasing a ticket, and this full transparency illustrates that our total price, including options selected, is lower on average than other airlines. 
Through branded campaigns, we educate the public on how our unbundled pricing model works and show them how it provides a choice on how they spend their money and saves them money compared to other airlines. We show our commitment to delivering the best value in the sky by continuing to make improvements to the customer experience, including a freshly updated cabin interior with ergonomically-designed seats and self bag-tagging in most airports to reduce check-in processing time. 
Our Strengths
We believe we compete successfully in the airline industry by leveraging the following demonstrated business strengths:
Ultra Low-Cost Structure. Our unit operating costs are among the lowest of all airlines operating in the United States. We believe this unit cost advantage helps protect our market position and enables us to offer some of the lowest base fares in our markets, sustain among the highest operating margins in our industry and support continued growth. Our operating costs per available seat mile ("CASM") of 8.07 cents in 2021 were significantly lower than those of the major domestic network carriers and among the lowest of the domestic low-cost carriers. We achieve these low unit operating costs in large part due to:
•high aircraft utilization;
•high-density seating configurations on our aircraft along with a simplified onboard product designed to lower costs;
•minimal hub-and-spoke network inefficiencies;
•highly productive workforce;
•opportunistic outsourcing of operating functions;
•operating a single-fleet type of Airbus A320-family aircraft that is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States and operated by common flight crews;
•reduced sales, marketing and distribution costs through direct-to-consumer marketing;
•efficient flight scheduling, including minimal ground times between flights; and
•a company-wide business culture that is keenly focused on driving costs lower.
Innovative Revenue Generation. We execute our innovative, unbundled pricing strategy to generate significant non-ticket revenue, which allows us to lower base fares and enables our passengers to identify, select and pay for only the products and services they want to use. In implementing our unbundled strategy, we have grown non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment from approximately $5 in 2006 to $59 in 2021 generally by:
•charging for checked and carry-on baggage;
•passing through most distribution-related expenses;
•charging for premium seats and advance seat selection;
•maintaining consistent ticketing policies, including service charges for changes and cancellations;
•generating subscription revenue from our Spirit Saver$ ClubTM (the "Spirit Saver$ ClubTM" formerly known as the $9 Fare ClubTM); 
•deriving brand-based revenues from proprietary services, such as our FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program;
•offering third-party travel products (travel packages), such as hotel rooms, ground transportation (rental and hotel shuttle products) and attractions (show or theme park tickets) packaged with air travel on our website; and 
•selling third-party travel insurance through our website.
Resilient Business Model and Customer Base. By focusing on price-sensitive travelers, we have generally maintained profitability or been impacted to a lesser degree than most of our competitors during volatile economic periods because we are not highly dependent on premium-fare business traffic. We believe our growing customer base is more resilient than the customer bases of most other airlines because our low fares and unbundled service offering appeal to price-sensitive travelers.
Well Positioned for Growth. We have developed a substantial network of destinations in profitable U.S. domestic niche markets, targeted growth markets in the Caribbean and Latin America and high-volume routes flown by price-sensitive travelers. In the United States, we also have grown into large markets that, due to higher fares, have priced out those more price-sensitive travelers. We seek to balance growth between large domestic markets, large leisure destinations and opportunities in the Caribbean and Latin America according to current economic and industry conditions.
Experienced International Operator. We believe we have substantial experience in foreign aviation, security and customs regulations, local ground operations and flight crew training required for successful international and overwater flight operations. All of our aircraft are certified for overwater operations. We believe we compete favorably against other low-cost carriers because we have been conducting international flight operations since 2003 and have developed substantial experience in complying with the various regulations and business practices in the international markets we serve. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, no revenue from any one foreign country represented greater than 4% of our total passenger revenue. We attribute operating revenues by geographic region based upon the origin and destination of each passenger flight segment.
Financial Strength Achieved with Focus on Cost Discipline. We believe our ULCC business model has delivered strong financial results in both favorable and more difficult economic times. We have generated these results by:
•keeping a consistent focus on maintaining low unit operating costs;
•ensuring our sourcing arrangements with key third parties are regularly benchmarked against the best industry standards; 
•generating and maintaining an adequate level of liquidity to insulate against volatility in key cost inputs, such as fuel and in passenger demand that may occur as a result of changing general economic conditions.
Loyalty Programs
We operate the Spirit Saver$ ClubTM, which is a subscription-based loyalty program that allows members access to unpublished, extra-low fares as well as discounted prices on bags, exclusive offers on hotels, rental cars and other travel necessities. In January 2021, the benefits of the Spirit Saver$ ClubTM were expanded to include discounts on seats, shortcut boarding and security, and "Flight Flex" flight modification product. We also operate the Free Spirit loyalty program (the “Free Spirit Program”), which attracts members and partners and builds customer loyalty for us by offering a variety of awards, benefits and services. Free Spirit loyalty program members earn and accrue points for our flights and services from non-air partners such as retail merchants, hotels or car rental companies or by making purchases with credit cards issued by partner banks and financial services providers. Points earned and accrued by Free Spirit loyalty program members can be redeemed for travel awards such as free (other than taxes and government-imposed fees), discounted or upgraded travel. In January 2021, we launched a more expansive Free Spirit Program with extended mileage expirations, additional benefits based on status tiers, and other changes. 
Route Network
Our route network includes 360 markets served by 85 airports throughout the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Below is a current map of our network, including seasonal destinations we serve:

Our network expansion targets underserved and/or overpriced markets. We employ a rigorous process to identify opportunities to deploy new aircraft where we believe they will be most profitable. To monitor the profitability of each route, we analyze weekly and monthly profitability reports as well as near-term forecasting.
Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record and reputation, code-sharing relationships and frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities. We typically compete in markets served by traditional network airlines, and other low-cost carriers and ULCCs, and, to a lesser extent, regional airlines. 
As of December 31, 2021, our top three largest network overlaps are with Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Frontier Airlines. Our principal competitive advantage is our relative cost advantage which allows us to offer low base fares profitably. In 2021, our unit operating costs were among the lowest in the U.S. airline industry. We believe our low unit costs coupled with our relatively stable non-ticket revenues allow us to price our fares at levels where we can be profitable while our primary competitors cannot. 
The airline industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because, once a flight is scheduled, airlines incur only nominal incremental costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. The expenses of a scheduled aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried and, as a result, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing could have a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flyer initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to maximize TRASM. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is unable to fill at higher rates. A key element to our competitive strategy is to maintain very low unit costs in order to permit us to compete successfully in price-sensitive markets.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters each year due to more vacation travel during these periods, as compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. 
Distribution
The majority of our tickets are sold through direct channels, including online via www.spirit.com, our call center and our airport ticket counters, with www.spirit.com being the primary channel. We also partner with a number of third parties to distribute our tickets, including online and traditional travel agents and electronic global distribution systems. 
Customers
We believe our customers are primarily leisure travelers who are paying for their own ticket and who make their purchase decision based largely on price. By maintaining a low cost structure, we have historically been able to successfully sell tickets at low fares while maintaining a strong profit margin. During 2020 and 2021, we were unable to deliver a profit due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our airline.
Customer Service
We are committed to taking care of our customers. We believe focusing on customer service in every aspect of our operations, including personnel, flight equipment, in-flight and ancillary amenities, on-time performance, flight completion ratios, and baggage handling will strengthen customer loyalty and attract new customers. We proactively aim to improve our operations to ensure further improvement in customer service. 
Our online booking process allows our customers to see all available options and their prices prior to purchasing a ticket. We maintain a campaign that illustrates our total prices are lower, on average, than those of our competitors, even when options are included.
Fleet
We fly only Airbus A320 family aircraft, which provides us significant operational and cost advantages compared to airlines that operate multiple aircraft types. By operating a single aircraft type, we avoid the incremental costs of training crews across multiple types. Flight crews are entirely interchangeable across all of our aircraft, and maintenance, spare parts inventories and other operational support remains highly simplified compared to those airlines with more complex fleets. Due to this commonality among Airbus single-aisle aircraft, we can retain the benefits of a fleet comprised of a single type of aircraft while still having the flexibility to match the capacity and range of the aircraft to the demands of each route.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a fleet of 173 Airbus single-aisle aircraft, which are commonly referred to as “A320 family” aircraft. A320 family aircraft include the A319, A320 and A321 models, which have broadly common design and equipment but differ most notably in fuselage length, service range and seat capacity. Within the A320 family of aircraft, models using existing engine technology may carry the suffix “ceo,” denoting the “current engine option,” while models equipped with new-generation engines may carry the suffix “neo,” denoting the “new engine option.” As of December 31, 2021, our fleet consisted of 31 A319ceos, 64 A320ceos, 48 A320neos and 30 A321ceos, and the average age of the fleet was 6.8 years. As of December 31, 2021, we had 106 aircraft, of which 46 aircraft are financed through fixed-rate long-term debt with 7 to 18 year terms, 27 aircraft are financed through enhanced equipment trust certificates ("EETCs") and 33 aircraft are currently unencumbered. Refer to “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—14. Debt and Other Obligations” for information regarding our debt financing. As of December 31, 2021, we had 67 aircraft financed under operating leases with lease term expirations between 2023 and 2039. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had 12 spare engines financed under operating leases and owned 20 unencumbered spare engines.
On December 20, 2019, we entered into an A320 NEO Family Purchase Agreement with Airbus S.A.S. ("Airbus") for the purchase of 100 new Airbus A320neo family aircraft, with options to purchase up to 50 additional aircraft. This agreement includes a mix of Airbus A319neo, A320neo and A321neo aircraft with such aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2027. As of December 31, 2021, our firm aircraft orders consisted of 120 A320 family aircraft with Airbus, including A319neos, A320neos and A321neos, with deliveries expected through 2027. As of December 31, 2021, we had secured financing for 17 aircraft, scheduled for delivery from Airbus through 2022 which will be financed through sale leaseback transactions. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had 36 direct operating leases for A320neos and A321neos with third-party lessors, with deliveries expected through 2024. During the third quarter of 2021, we entered into an Engine Purchase Support Agreement which requires us to purchase a certain number of spare engines in order to maintain a contractual ratio of spare engines to aircraft in the fleet. As of December 31, 2021, we are committed to purchase 16 PW1100G-JM spare engines, with deliveries through 2027. The firm aircraft orders provide for capacity growth as well as the flexibility to add to, or replace, the aircraft in our present fleet. We may elect to supplement these deliveries by additional acquisitions from the manufacturer or in the open market if demand conditions merit. We also may adjust or defer deliveries, or change models of aircraft in our delivery stream, from time to time, as a means to match our future capacity with anticipated demand and growth trends. 
Consistent with our ULCC business model, each of our aircraft is configured with a high density seating configuration, which helps us maintain a lower unit cost. Our high density seating configuration accommodates more passengers than those of our competitors when comparing the same type of aircraft. 
Maintenance and Repairs
We maintain our aircraft in accordance with an FAA-approved maintenance program built from the manufacturers recommended maintenance schedule and maintained by our Technical Services department. Our maintenance technicians undergo extensive initial and recurrent training to ensure the safe operation of our aircraft. For the fourth year in a row, Spirit has achieved the FAA’s highest award for Technical Training, the Diamond Award of Excellence. This award is only achieved if 100% of technicians receive the FAA’s Aircraft Maintenance Technician (“AMT”) Certificate of Training.
Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance and component service. Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks on our aircraft, including pre-flight, daily, weekly and overnight checks, and any diagnostics and routine repairs and any unscheduled items on an as needed basis. Additionally, maintenance program tasks that may take up to two years to fully complete are performed periodically in line maintenance at scheduled day visits or segmented into overnight work packages. Line maintenance events are currently serviced by in-house mechanics supplemented by contract labor and are primarily completed at airports we currently serve. Heavy airframe maintenance checks consist of a series of more complex tasks that can take from one to four weeks to accomplish and typically are required approximately every 36 months. Heavy engine maintenance is performed approximately every six years and includes a more complex scope of work. Due to our relatively small fleet size and projected fleet growth, we believe outsourcing all of our heavy maintenance activity, such as engine servicing, heavy airframe maintenance checks, major part repair and component service repairs is more economical. Outsourcing eliminates the substantial initial capital requirements inherent in heavy aircraft maintenance. We have entered into a long-term flight hour agreement for the majority of our current fleet with International Aero Engines AG ("IAE") 
and Pratt & Whitney for our engine overhaul services and with various maintenance providers on an hour-by-hour basis for component services. We outsource our heavy airframe maintenance to FAA-qualified maintenance providers. 
Our recent maintenance expenses have been lower than what we expect to incur in the future because of the relatively young age of our aircraft fleet. Our maintenance costs are expected to increase as the scope of repairs increases with the increasing age of our fleet. As our aircraft age, scheduled scope of work and frequency of unscheduled maintenance events is likely to increase like any maturing fleet. Our aircraft utilization rate could decrease with the increase in aircraft maintenance.
We own and operate a 126,000-square-foot maintenance hangar facility, adjacent to the airfield at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, which allows us to reduce our dependence on third-party facilities and contract line maintenance. Please see “-Properties-Ground Facilities.”
Employees
Our business is labor intensive, with labor costs representing approximately 32.4%, 39.3% and 26.0% of our total operating costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,744 pilots, 4,597 flight attendants, 75 dispatchers, 268 ramp service agents, 224 passenger service agents, 900 maintenance personnel, 208 airport agents/other and 807 employees in administrative roles for a total of 9,823 active employees compared to 8,756 active employees as of December 31, 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, there were 1,633 employee terminations, including both voluntary and involuntary terminations, for an overall employee turnover rate of 18.7%. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 81% of our employees were represented by five labor unions. On an average full-time equivalent basis, for the full year 2021, we had 9,218 employees, compared to 8,692 in 2020.
FAA regulations require pilots to have commercial licenses with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown and be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements, including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. For the year ended December 31, 2021, paid training hours for our pilots and flight attendants were 147,533 and 38,149 hours, representing 12.8% and 1.6% of total crew block hours, respectively. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors and dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations. All safety-sensitive employees are subject to pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing. 
Consistent with our core values, we focus on hiring highly productive and qualified personnel and ensure they have comprehensive training. Our training programs focus on and emphasize the importance of safety, customer service, productivity, and cost control. We provide continuous training for our crew members including technical training as well as regular training focused on safety and front-line training for our customer service teams. Our training programs include classroom learning, extensive real-world flying experience, and instruction in full flight simulators, as appropriate.
Additionally, in 2021, we launched a comprehensive Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging strategy, to drive meaningful change within the organization and the communities in which we live and work. This includes Team Member run employee resource groups (ERGs) to ensure all Team Members have a voice in paving our path; providing education to increase awareness of systemic inequities and to reduce bias; and a new Supplier Diversity program around a network of minority-owned business partners and diverse suppliers, as part of our strategic sourcing and procurement process.
We believe a direct relationship between Team Members and our leadership is in the best interests of our crew members, our customers, and our shareholders. Our leadership team communicates on a regular basis with all Team Members, including crew members, in order to maintain a direct relationship and to keep them informed about news, strategy updates, and challenges affecting the airline and the industry. Effective and frequent communication throughout the organization is fostered through various means including email messages from our CEO and other senior leaders, open forum meetings across our network, periodic leadership visits to our stations, and annual Team Member engagement surveys. We also seek to build human rights awareness among our Team Members and Guests and we have recently implemented a Human Rights Policy.
The Railway Labor Act, or RLA, governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, our collective bargaining agreements do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date, subject to standard early opener provisions. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations. If no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board, or NMB, to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time 
that an impasse exists. If an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board, or PEB, may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization and the airline each may resort to “self-help,” including, for the labor organization, a strike or other labor action, and for the airline, the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties. The table below sets forth our employee groups and status of the collective bargaining agreements.

Employee Groups | Representative | Amendable Date
Pilots | Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) | February 2023 
Flight Attendants | Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) | September 2021
Dispatchers | Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA) | October 2023 
Ramp Service Agents | International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) | November 2026 
Passenger Service Agents | Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) | NA 

In March 2016, under the supervision of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. Our flight attendants ratified the agreement in May 2016. In February 2021, we entered into a Letter of Agreement with the AFA-CWA to change the amendable date of the collective bargaining agreement from May 4, 2021 to September 1, 2021. All other terms of the collective bargaining agreement remained the same. In June 2021, the AFA-CWA notified us, as required by the Railway Labor Act, that it intended to submit proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement covering our flight attendants. We commenced negotiations with the AFA-CWA on September 27, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we continued to negotiate with the AFA-CWA.
Our dispatchers are represented by PAFCA. In October 2018, we reached a tentative agreement with PAFCA for a new five-year agreement, which was ratified by the PAFCA members in October 2018. 
In July 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, covering material economic terms. In June 2016, we reached an agreement on the remaining terms of the collective bargaining agreement. In February 2020, the IAMAW notified us, as required by the Railway Labor Act, that it intended to submit proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement covering our ramp service agents which became amendable in June 2020. On September 28, 2021, we filed an “Application for Mediation Services” with the NMB. We were able to reach a tentative agreement with the IAMAW with the assistance of the NMB on October 16, 2021. Our ramp service agents ratified the five-year agreement in November 2021. 
In June 2018, our passenger service agents voted to be represented by the TWU, but the representation only applies to our Fort Lauderdale station where we have direct employees in the passenger service classification. We began meeting with the TWU in late October 2018 to negotiate an initial collective bargaining agreement. During February 2022, we reached a tentative agreement with the TWU, which will need to be ratified by the passenger service agents.
Safety and Security
We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. We strive to comply with or exceed health and safety regulation standards. In pursuing these goals, we maintain an active aviation safety program. All of our personnel are expected to participate in the program and take an active role in the identification, reduction and elimination of hazards.
Our ongoing focus on safety relies on training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our business, including: flight operations, maintenance, in-flight, dispatch and station operations. The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is charged with aviation security for both airlines and airports. We maintain active, open lines of communication with the TSA at all of our locations to ensure proper standards for security of our personnel, customers, equipment and facilities are exercised throughout our business.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies we believe are customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire and extended coverage; war risk (terrorism); directors’ and officers’ liability; advertiser and media liability; cyber risk liability; fiduciary; and workers’ compensation and employer’s liability. Renewing coverage could result in a change in premium and more restrictive terms. Although we currently believe our insurance coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not be changed or that we will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents. 
Management Information Systems
We have continued our commitment to technology improvements to support our ongoing operations and initiatives. In 2019, we implemented a new website built on a more stable codebase which provides for a better user experience. In addition, we invested in improving the stability of our mobile application.
 In 2020, we continued to migrate critical business applications into the cloud infrastructure, allowing us to take increasing advantage of the analytics and automation functions. These improvements provide further opportunities to increase business intelligence and flexibility, improve business continuity, mitigate disaster scenarios and enhance data security. We intend to continue to invest resources in cyber security to protect our data, operations and our customers' privacy.
In 2021, we focused on additional modernization capabilities to enhance the travel experience of our Guests. In cooperation with the TSA, our Automated Self Service Bag Drop project is installed and functioning in several airports. Our plan is to accelerate the deployment of this experience as well as to further enhance the customer convenience features. In addition, we have achieved a broad investment in a mobility tool for all our workforce that enhances productivity and capabilities. Furthermore, the launch of our new Loyalty program has delivered an exceptional improvement in the Guest experience and utility. In 2021, the Azure Cloud migration of Data and Application continued and is expected to be completed by early 2023. Lastly, our secondary Operations Control Center in Orlando went into production mid-year and will provide substantial improvements in disaster recovery scenarios.
Foreign Ownership
Under DOT regulations and federal law, we must be controlled by U.S. citizens. In order to qualify, at least 75% of our stock must be voted by U.S. citizens, and our president and at least two-thirds of our board of directors and senior management must be U.S. citizens. 
We believe we are currently in compliance with such foreign ownership rules. 
Government Regulation
Operational Regulation
The airline industry is heavily regulated, especially by the federal government. Two of the primary regulatory authorities overseeing air transportation in the United States are the DOT and the FAA. The DOT has jurisdiction over economic and consumer issues affecting air transportation, such as competition, route authorizations, advertising and sales practices, baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation, reporting of mishandled bags, tarmac delays and responding to customer complaints among other areas. 
In July 2021, the DOT issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NRPM) requiring airlines to refund checked bag fees for delayed bags if they are not delivered to the passenger within a specified number of hours and refunding ancillary fees for services related to air travel that passengers did not receive. As of December 31, 2021, a final rule has not been issued. 
In November 2021, the DOT reopened the comment period on an NPRM regarding short-term improvements to lavatory accessibility, including new proposed requirements for onboard wheelchairs (OBWs). As of December 31, 2021, a final rule has not been issued.
The Biden Administration issued an executive order mandating that masks be worn on commercial aircraft. This was extended in December 2021 to at least March 2022. We will continue to follow all relevant guidelines and guidance to protect our guests and staff, but we cannot forecast what additional safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the extent of any pre-travel testing requirements (See “International Regulation”) that may be under consideration in the United States and that may be in place, or renewed, in any foreign jurisdiction we serve, including the effect of such requirements on passenger demand or the costs or revenue impact that would be associated with complying with such requirements.
Additional rules and executive orders, including those pertaining to disabled passengers, may be issued. See “Risk Factors—Restrictions on or increased taxes applicable to charges for ancillary products and services paid by airline passengers and burdensome consumer protection regulations or laws which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition."
The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide air transportation. We hold a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing us to engage in scheduled air transportation of passengers, property and mail within the United States, its territories and possessions and between the United States and all countries that maintain a liberal aviation trade relationship with the United States (known as “open skies” countries). We also hold DOT certificates to engage in air transportation to certain other countries with more restrictive aviation policies.
The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to air carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates, aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety, including rest periods and work hours for all airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. This certificate, in combination with operations specifications issued to the airline by the FAA, authorizes the airline to operate at specific airports using aircraft approved by the FAA. As of December 31, 2021, we had FAA airworthiness certificates for all of our aircraft, we had obtained the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the cities we currently serve, and all of our aircraft had been certified for overwater operations. Any new or revised operational regulations in the future could result in further increased costs. We believe we hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations, certificates and licenses and are operating in compliance with applicable DOT and FAA regulations, interpretations and policies.
International Regulation
All international service is subject to the regulatory requirements of the foreign government involved. We generally offer international service to Aruba, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and St. Maarten, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If we decide to increase our routes to additional international destinations, we will be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government. We are also required to comply with overfly regulations in countries that lay along our routes but which we do not serve.
International service is also subject to Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, immigration and agriculture requirements and the requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. Like other airlines flying international routes, from time to time we may be subject to civil fines and penalties imposed by CBP if unmanifested or illegal cargo, such as illegal narcotics, is found on our aircraft. These fines and penalties, which in the case of narcotics are based upon the retail value of the seizure, may be substantial. We have implemented a comprehensive security program at our airports to reduce the risk of illegal cargo being placed on our aircraft, and we seek to cooperate actively with CBP and other U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies in investigating incidents or attempts to introduce illegal cargo.
We will continue to comply with all contagious disease requirements issued by the US and foreign governments, but we cannot forecast what additional requirements may be imposed in the future or the costs or revenue impact that would be associated with complying with such requirements. For example, as of December 6, 2021, all air passengers 2 years or older with a flight departing to the United States from a foreign country are required show a negative COVID-19 viral test result taken no more than 1 day before travel, or documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days, before they board their flight. See, “Risk Factors—“We are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by the FAA, DOT, TSA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, compliance with which could cause us to incur increased costs and adversely affect our business and financial results."
Security Regulation
The TSA was created in 2001 with the responsibility and authority to oversee the implementation, and ensure the adequacy of security measures at airports and other transportation facilities. Funding for passenger security is provided in part by a per enplanement ticket tax (passenger security fee). Prior to and for the first half of 2014, this fee was $2.50 per passenger flight segment, subject to a maximum of $5 per one-way trip. Effective July 1, 2014, the security fee was set at a flat rate of $5.60 each way. On December 19, 2014, the law was amended to limit a round-trip fee to $11.20. We cannot forecast what additional security and safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the costs or revenue impact that would be associated with complying with such requirements.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as aircraft engine emissions, aircraft noise emissions and the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals, which laws and regulations are administered by numerous state and federal agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, regulates operations, including air carrier operations, which affect the quality of air in the United States. We believe the aircraft in our fleet meet all emission standards issued by the EPA. Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad.
Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during takeoff and initial climb, and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport.
Other Regulations
We are subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and are required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we will take all necessary steps to comply with those requirements. We are also subject to state and local laws and regulations at locations where we operate and the regulations of various local authorities that operate the airports we serve. In addition, we are subject to the deployment of new 5G C-band service by wireless communications providers. The DOT and the FAA are currently working with AT&T and Verizon to create appropriate safeguards in the deployment of their new 5G C-band service, including a potential delay in its overall deployment, the installation of buffer zones around airports and other measures to be announced.
Future Regulations
The U.S. and foreign governments may consider and adopt new laws, regulations, interpretations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect our results of operations. We cannot predict what laws, regulations, interpretations and policies might be considered in the future, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
We are committed to integrating environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) practices into and within our business practices and commit to sustainable operations which support the long-term success of our business, shareholders, Team Members, Guests and business partners. We have established four strategic focus areas of our ESG initiatives, practices, and commitments: environment, social, workforce and governance. Recognizing the fundamental importance of ESG matters, Spirit’s Board and its committees provide guidance and oversight. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for oversight of our ESG strategy and practices and periodically reports on these matters to the Board.
We recognize aviation’s impact on climate and our responsibility to help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel. Fuel burn is our greatest environmental and financial impact, and our greatest source of carbon emissions. To address the impact of our flights and operations over the short-term and long-term, our climate and emissions approach focuses on reducing emissions through both fleet and operational efficiencies that conserve fuel and improve overall fuel burn. Our all-Airbus fleet is one of the youngest in the United States and our dense seating configuration, along with our consistent focus on weight-saving measures, has made us consistently one of the most fuel-efficient carriers in the United States.
Further illustrating our commitment, we issued our 2020 Sustainability Report, showing results of our longstanding commitment to meaningful advancements in environmental sustainability, Guest and community service, Team Member support, and governance. The report highlights our plan for continued progress in broadening ESG initiatives and improving communities.
