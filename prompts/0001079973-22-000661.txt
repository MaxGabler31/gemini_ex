ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. Through our subsidiaries, 42West LLC (“42West”), The Door Marketing Group LLC (“The Door”), Shore Fire Media, Ltd (“Shore Fire”), Viewpoint Computer Animation, Inc. (“Viewpoint”), Be Social Public Relations, LLC (“Be Social”) and B/HI Communications, Inc. (“B/HI”), we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the motion picture, television, music, gaming, culinary, hospitality and lifestyle industries. 42West (Film and Television, Gaming), Shore Fire (Music), and The Door (Culinary, Hospitality, Lifestyle) are each recognized global PR and marketing leaders for the industries they serve. (B/HI is considered a division of 42West throughout the rest of our discussion.) Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides influencer marketing capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin’s legacy content production business, founded by our Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O’Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.
 
We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DLPN”.
 
We currently operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment is composed of 42West, Shore Fire, The Door, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic communications, social media marketing, creative branding, and the production of promotional video content. The content production segment is composed of Dolphin Films, Inc. (“Dolphin Films”) and a department within Dolphin, which produce and distribute feature films and digital content.
 
With respect to our entertainment publicity and marketing segment, we currently see a favorable environment for organic growth, as evidenced by sequential quarterly revenue growth in 2021. The original content budgets of many large studios and streaming services have grown considerably the past few years, and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we have seen the entrance of large streaming services such as Disney+, Apple TV, Peacock (from NBCUniversal), HBO Max, Paramount+ and Discovery, all to compete with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. We believe that the foremost differentiating factor for all of these platforms will be original programming and, consequently, it is anticipated that there will be an increase of tens of billions of dollars in programming spent across the market. We also believe that each of these original shows will need substantial public relations and marketing campaigns to drive consumer awareness of both the shows themselves and the respective platforms on which to find them.
 
Additionally, we have endeavored to create a “marketing super group,” combining marketing, public relations, branding, and digital production, that will serve as a platform for organic growth via the cross-selling of services among our subsidiaries. By way of example, our initial public relations companies (42West, Shore Fire, and The Door) have identified the ability to create content for clients as a “must have” for public relations campaigns in today’s environment, which relies so heavily on video clips to drive social media awareness and engagement. Thus, we believe that our subsidiary Viewpoint provided a critical competitive advantage in the acquisition of new clients in the entertainment and lifestyle marketing space, and will continue to fuel topline revenue growth as the average revenue per client increases with the cross-selling of video content creation services. Furthermore, influencer marketing campaigns are considered essential to so many consumer product earned media campaigns in today’s online marketplace, creating large cross-selling opportunities between our PR agencies and Be Social’s expertise and services.

We believe that our expanding portfolio of public relations and marketing companies will continue to attract future acquisitions. We believe that our “marketing super group” is unique in the industry, as a collection of best-in-class service providers across a variety of entertainment and lifestyle verticals. We further believe that with each new acquisition in this space, our portfolio will increase its breadth and depth of services and, therefore, be able to offer an even more compelling opportunity for other industry leaders to join, and enjoy the benefits of cross-selling to a wide variety of existing and potential clients. Thus, we believe we can continue to grow both revenues and profits through future acquisitions into our entertainment publicity and marketing segment.
 
Finally, we believe our ability to engage a broad consumer base through our best-in-class pop culture assets provides us an opportunity to make investments in products or companies which would benefit from our collective marketing power. We call these investments “Dolphin 2.0” (with “Dolphin 1.0” being the underlying businesses of each of our subsidiaries).
 
Simply put, we seek to own some of the assets we are marketing. Specifically, we want to own assets where our experience, industry relationships and marketing power will most influence the likelihood of success. This leads us to seek investments in the following categories of assets: 1) Content; 2) Live Events; and 3) Consumer Products.
 
The first of our 2.0 investments has been in the new world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). We see a large opportunity in this sector. Even without broad consumer adoption, the NFT market grew from an estimated $250 million in 2020 to over $40 billion in 2021, according to Bloomberg. We believe the NFT market will continue to grow at a rapid pace for years to come, driven by the combination of 1) the ability of consumers to purchase using a credit card (and not just with cryptocurrencies); 2) consumer-friendly pricing options (previously not readily available due to large “gas fees” charged by both sellers and buyers of NFTs to offset the energy consumption required to “mint” the NFT for sale); and 3) popular entertainment and pop culture collectibles being offered.
 
In March 2021, we announced our intentions to enter into the production and marketing of NFTs. In August, 2021, we announced our partnership with FTX.US, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, to develop and launch NFT collections across all major entertainment industry verticals (film, television, music, gaming, etc.). In October, 2021, we announced the hiring of Anthony Francisco, former Senior Visual Development Artist at Marvel Studios, and designer of many iconic characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to be Creative Director of our NFT studios. And in December, 2021, we unveiled our first collection, entitled “Creature Chronicles: Exiled Aliens,” a generative art collection of 10,000 unique avatars created by Mr. Francisco.
 
Our second Dolphin 2.0 investment was made in October, 2021, when we acquired an ownership stake in Midnight Theatre, a state-of-the-art contemporary variety theater and restaurant in the heart of Manhattan. An anchor of Brookfield Properties’ recently opened $4.5 billion Manhattan West development, the Midnight Theatre is in the final stages of construction, and expects to open in Spring, 2022. The Midnight Theatre will feature three distinct experiences for guests: the theatre itself; a separate pan-Asian restaurant, Hidden Leaf; and a ground-level café. We will manage all aspects of publicity and marketing for the venue (both theatre and restaurant), as well as facilitate talent and commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary industries.
 
The Midnight Theatre will have a weekly schedule of performances and immersive experiences across music, comedy, Broadway, and narrative magic shows programmed at the 160-seat venue. The contemporary variety theatre integrates state-of-the-art 270 degree projection mapped visuals into live performances, allowing for unprecedented intimacy between performers and guests. The Midnight Theatre also has built in live-stream capabilities, allowing for events inside the theatre to expand beyond into people’s homes and corporate offices. The theatre will be available to host live streamed podcasts, comedy specials, music events, corporate keynote events, and more.
 
Hidden Leaf is the modern pan-Asian restaurant concept on the second floor of The Midnight Theatre space, led by acclaimed restauranteur Josh Cohen. The restaurant features a 75-seat dining room, 20-seat private dining room and a 40-seat lounge/bar area. Hidden Leaf will be open for both lunch and dinner, and will incorporate world-class food with interactive elements such as table-side prep, wine consignments, and memberships.
 
Our third Dolphin 2.0 investment was made in December, 2021, when we acquired an ownership stake in Crafthouse Cocktails, a pioneering brand of ready-to-drink, all-natural classic cocktails created by world renowned mixologist, Charles Joly and esteemed restaurateur, Matt Lindner. Founded in 2013, Crafthouse Cocktails is an award-winning pioneer in the premium ready-to-drink cocktail category, with eight different, made-from-scratch cocktails, using all-natural ingredients and premium craft spirits, available in more than 2,000 retail locations nationally. We will manage all aspects of publicity and marketing for the brand through our network of agencies and will facilitate talent and commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary industries.

Growth Opportunities and Strategies
 
For Dolphin 1.0, we are focused on driving growth through the following efforts:
 
Expand and grow 42West to serve more clients with a broad array of interrelated services. We believe that the launch and growth of a large number of streaming services over the last two years represents tremendous organic growth opportunities for 42West, due to the increase in potential new clients and a larger number of individual projects to promote.
 
Enhanced by Dolphin’s acquisitions of Be Social and Viewpoint, 42West has the ability to both structure influencer marketing campaigns and create promotional and marketing content for clients, which are critical services for entertainment content marketers in today’s digital world.
 
Through our acquisition of B/HI in January, 2021 (considered a division of 42West), 42West has entered into the “sister” entertainment verticals of video gaming and e-sports. We believe these industries represent a tremendous growth opportunity for 42West.
 
Furthermore, the growing involvement in non-entertainment businesses by many of our existing entertainment clients has allowed 42West to establish a presence and develop expertise outside its traditional footprint. Using this as a foundation, we are now working to expand our involvement in these new areas.
 
Expand and grow Shore Fire Media to serve more clients in more genres of music and in more markets. For over 30 years, Shore Fire has been a leader in providing public relations and marketing services to a broad array of songwriters, recording artists, publishers and others within the music industry, all from its headquarters in Brooklyn. We plan to significantly expand Shore Fire’s presence in other major music markets, including Los Angeles, Nashville and Miami, which we believe will provide access to potential clients across a wide array of popular musical genres, including pop, country and Latin.
 
Expand and grow The Door through the expansion of Consumer Products PR business.  The Door’s market-leading position in both the food and hospitality verticals, with many clients that have consumer-facing products and the need for attendant marketing campaigns, has provided the Company with the requisite experience for a successful entry into the high-margin consumer products PR business with potential clients outside of the food and hospitality verticals. We plan to significantly increase the number of consumer products PR accounts at The Door. Such accounts often generate higher monthly fees and longer-term engagements than any other of our customer verticals.
 
Diversify Viewpoint’s Client Base. Viewpoint is a leading creative branding agency and promotional video content producer for the television industry, with long-term clients such as HBO, Discovery Networks, Showtime and AMC. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, Viewpoint can offer its best-in-class services to several new verticals, including motion picture production and distribution companies, video game publishers, musical artists, restaurant groups, the hospitality and travel industry and the marketers of consumer products. The ability for Viewpoint to reach clients of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire provides Viewpoint with the opportunity to diversify its client base, while allowing 42West, The Door and Shore Fire to increase their service offerings to, existing and future clients, potentially driving increased revenues.
 
Diversify Be Social’s Client Base. Be Social is a leading influencer marketing agency, with a specialization in the beauty, fashion and wellness industries. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, Be Social can offer its services to several new verticals, including motion picture and television content, podcasts, musical artists and labels, restaurant groups, hotels and resorts, the travel industry, the gaming and e-sports industry, and the marketers of broader consumer products. The ability for Be Social to reach clients of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire provides Be Social with the opportunity to diversify its client base, while allowing 42West, The Door and Shore Fire to increase their service offerings to, existing and future clients, potentially driving increased revenues.
 
Opportunistically grow through complementary acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions to further enhance our competitive advantages, scale our revenues, and increase our profitability. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity services businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as live event production companies and PR firms in other entertainment verticals, can create synergistic opportunities that may increase profits and operating cash flow.

For Dolphin 2.0, we are focused on driving growth through the following efforts:
 
Build a portfolio of premium film, television and digital content. We intend to grow and diversify our portfolio of film, television and digital content by capitalizing on demand for high quality digital media and film content throughout the world marketplace. We plan to balance our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Finally, we believe that marketing strategies that will be developed by our best-in-class entertainment PR and marketing companies will drive our creative content, thus creating greater potential for profitability.
 
Build an NFT Studio, to produce, distribute and market NFT collections. We intend to build an NFT studio on the traditional “slate model” employed by the major motion picture studios. We will seek to develop compelling NFT collections, drawing upon our relationships in the entertainment industry, and schedule their release throughout the calendar year. We will use the totality of our PR and marketing experience and reach to support these releases, which we believe can be a differentiating factor in this emerging industry.
 
Promotion of Midnight Theatre. As noted above, Midnight Theatre is currently scheduled to open in Spring, 2022. All Dolphin PR and Marketing subsidiaries will support the promotional campaigns for the opening of Midnight Theatre. We will also seek to support the programming slate of the theatre itself, through our relationships across music, Broadway and other forms of entertainment.
 
Assist Crafthouse Cocktails on its expansion. We believe Crafthouse Cocktails is a fantastic product, poised for growth. We will seek to create and execute PR and marketing campaigns to assist Crafthouse in growing its retail presence, both in states where the brand currently is available, as well as new states across the country.
 
Entertainment Publicity and Marketing
 
42West
 Through 42West, an entertainment public relations agency, we offer talent publicity, entertainment (motion picture and television) marketing, video game and eSports marketing, and strategic communications services. Prior to its acquisition, 42West grew to become one of the largest independently-owned public relations firms in the entertainment industry, and in December 2019 (the most recent year of such rankings), 42West was ranked #4 in the annual rankings of the nation’s Power 50 PR firms by the New York Observer, the highest position held by an entertainment PR firm. As such, we believe that 42West has served, and will continue to serve, as an “acquisition magnet” for us to acquire new members of our marketing “super group,” which has the ability to provide synergistic new members with the opportunity to grow revenues and profits through 42West’s access, relationships and experience in the entertainment industry.
 
Marketing professionals at 42West develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for dozens of movies and television shows annually, as well as for individual actors, filmmakers, recording artists, video game publishers, and authors. Through 42West, we provide services in the following areas:

The Door
 
Through The Door, a hospitality, lifestyle and consumer products public relations agency, we offer traditional public relations services, as well as social media marketing, creative branding, and strategic counsel. Prior to its acquisition, The Door was widely considered the leading independent public relations firm in the hospitality and lifestyle industries. Among other benefits, The Door acquisition has expanded our entertainment verticals through the addition of celebrity chefs and their restaurants, as well as with live events, such as some of the most prestigious and well-attended food and wine festivals in the United States. Our public relations and marketing professionals at The Door develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for dozens of restaurant and hotel groups annually, as well as for individual chefs, live events, and consumer-facing corporations.

Competition
 
The businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Through 42West, Shore Fire and The Door, we compete against other public relations and marketing communications companies, as well as independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. Through Viewpoint and Be Social, we compete against other creative branding and influencer marketing agencies, as well as in-house teams at many of our clients. Our content production business faces competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities. We are subject to competition from other digital media and motion production companies, as well as from large, well-established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars.
 
We believe that we compete on the basis of the following competitive strengths:
