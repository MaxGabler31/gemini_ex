Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Ipsidy Inc. (formerly known as ID Global Solutions Corporation) together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we” or “our”), is a provider of secure, biometric identification, identity management and electronic transaction processing services. In a world that is increasingly digital and mobile, our vision is to enable solutions that provide pre-transaction authentication of identity as well as embed identity attributes within every electronic transaction message processed through our platform, or other electronic systems.

We are building upon our existing capabilities in biometric identification and multi-factor identity authentication and management solutions to develop an identity transaction platform for our business customers. The platform is being designed to enable the end users of our business customers to more easily authenticate their identity through a mobile phone or portable device of their choosing (as opposed to dedicated hardware). Our system enables participants to complete transactions with a digitally signed authentication response, including the underlying transaction data and embedded attributes of the participant’s identity.
 
We believe that it is essential that businesses and consumers know who is on the other side of an electronic transaction and have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the other party was duly authenticated. We are therefore developing solutions intended to provide our customers with the next level of transaction security, control and certainty. Our platform uses biometric and multi-factor identity management solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions. We define “electronic transactions” in the broadest sense to include not only financial transactions (i.e. exchanges of value in all of their forms), and legal transactions (e.g. approving the release of personal or other confidential data or the execution of documents), but also access control to physical environments (e.g. border crossings and secure areas at offices, data centers and other sensitive locations) and digital environments (e.g. accessing account information, voting systems, email systems and controlling data network log-ins).
 
The Company’s products focus on the broad requirement for identity, access and transaction authentication and associated identity management needs and the requirement for cost-effective and secure mobile electronic transaction solutions for institutions and their customers. We aim to offer our customers solutions that can be integrated into each customer’s business operations in order to facilitate their use and enhance the end user customer experience.
 
Our digital mobile wallet applications, or electronic account holders are currently being piloted. This electronic account holder is used to contain different services and accounts that can be easily added and enable users to conveniently and securely effect a variety of electronic transactions, using their identity. One example is our closed-loop payment account, digital issuance platform, currently in user acceptance testing, that is intended to offer secure and cost-effective methods of conversion of cash and paper to electronic payments. Consumers accessing this system, using their mobile phones, electronic devices, or smart card payment tokens will be able to participate in the digital economy thereby facilitating financial inclusion for the un-banked and under banked population around the globe. Another example is for consumers and employees to use their mobile application to authenticate identity, in order to access secure digital, or physical environments. We have recently launched a pilot of the Ipsidy Access solution using our IDLok authentication service providing access control to commercial, multi-tenanted buildings.
 
Management believes that some of the advantages of the Company’s Transaction Platform approach are the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets including the identity management and transaction processing sectors and the adaptability of the platform to the requirements of new markets and new products requiring low cost, secure, and configurable mobile solutions. These vertical markets include but are not limited to elections, border security, public safety, public transportation, enterprise security, payment transactions and banking. The Company believes that the various technologies that the Company is developing and has acquired can be combined into a unified offering. At its core, this offering is intended to facilitate the processing of diverse electronic transactions, be they payments, votes, or physical or digital access, all of which can include identity management, authentication and identity transaction recording.
 
The Company’s solutions for fingerprint based identity management and electronic payment transaction processing are in the market today. For example, in December 2017, we won an international competitive tender to provide our IDSearch Automated Fingerprint Identification de-duplication system (AFIS) to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, for them to ensure that no duplicate entries exist in the voter roll for the forthcoming election. We are still in the process of integrating the technologies, which we have developed internally with those we have acquired and thereby creating combined solutions intended to better service our target markets. The Company continues to invest in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to complete the platform, which is intended to allow us to achieve our goals. In order to achieve this integration and development, the Company will need to raise additional capital.

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 21, 2011 and changed its name to Ipsidy Inc. on February 1, 2017, and our common stock is traded on the OTCQB Venture Market under the trading symbol “IDTY”. Our corporate headquarters is located at 780 Long Beach Blvd., Long Beach, NY 11561 and our main phone number is (516) 274-8700. We maintain a website at www.ipsidy.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 
Global Market Opportunity
 
We believe that there are several market trends that drive growth in the identity management and electronic transaction processing marketplace, including growing concerns over identity theft and fraud and the increase in electronic payments, solutions provided by non-bank entities. Moreover, the individual’s increasing reliance on devices of their choosing most often a mobile phone, or portable computing device requires both software and hardware providers to incorporate these technologies into their offerings.
 
While an increasingly digital world drives convenience, it also drives an increasing risk of compromised passwords, security breaches and stolen identities. With every online purchase, e-bill payment and download of new travel, dining and gaming ‘apps’ to a mobile smartphone, the footprint of consumers’ digital identity expands. In 2014, the US e-commerce marketplace suffered over $4 billion in fraud affecting card-not-present payment transactions and this figure is projected to more than double by 2020. (Source: The Nilson Report). The number of fraud victims in the U.S. rose by eight percent in 2017 to total 16.7 million, according to data released by Javelin Strategy & Research in February 2018. U.S. consumers experienced a total of $16.8 billion in fraud losses (Source: February 12, 2018 ABA Banking Journal)
 
To combat fraud and to better confirm customers’ identities, we see an increasing deployment of biometric solutions in the marketplace. In their 2016 report, Goode Intelligence forecast that by 2020 over 1.1 billion financial services customers will be using mobile biometrics to access and secure their accounts, and more than 16 billion mobile biometric payment transactions will be made.
 
IHS Markit, forecasts in their report on Internet of Things, or IOT that the number of devices connected to the IOT, will increase from an installed base of 15.4 billion devices in 2016 to 30.7 billion devices in 2020 and 70.4 billion devices in 2025 (Source IHS Markit “IoT Platforms: Enabling the Internet of Things” March 2017). According to the report, one of the major challenges facing the growth of IOT is data security and privacy and IOT platform solutions will need to have authentication identity management and other security, as a key component of the platform.
 
The Company intends to develop additional products which will provide identity or authentication in the processing of automated electronic transactions from Internet connected devices, in order to ensure that the owner of the device has certainty as to the recipient of the data and the transaction i.e. the owner will be able to control the transaction and approve or decline the completion of the requested event. In addition, our solutions allow the originator of the transaction, who will be relying on the authentication, to know that the user signed the transaction.
 
Despite heightened awareness of digital security resulting from a number of high profile incidents, including those at Yahoo and Equifax that exposed personal data of millions of consumers, access to digital services and thus our identities is still secured in the majority of cases only through a simple username and password, although more services are introducing two factor authentication. In the United States, the most common identifier is still the social security number, which hacks of Government databases have shown is very vulnerable to being stolen. Governments, institutions and enterprises have therefore become concerned to find more secure ways to verify and authenticate identity and manage the identities of the persons with whom they need to interact, be they employees, customers, authorized users or citizens.
 
Businesses spend significant capital on acquiring and deploying dedicated equipment to fulfill a variety of their business requirements. The ubiquitous availability and use of mobile devices, which consumers have become accustomed to using for a wide variety of functions, creates the opportunity to dispense with dedicated equipment in favor of an easily downloadable “app” for a mobile device. We are continuing to enhance our solutions for our customers in order to take advantage of this global trend. For example, the upgrading of traditional point of sale payment card terminals with payment enabled mobile phones, tablets and devices. Another example would be access to a locked door by recognition of the presence of the user’s phone instead of a hardware token, using the security features of a mobile device enabled with the Company’s suite of identity solutions

Electronic payments of all forms have continued to grow at a healthy rate. According to the World Payments Report 2017, published by Capgemini and BNP Paribas, global non-cash transaction volumes increased by 7.8% in 2013, while in Latin America the increase was 8.7% and in Central Europe, Middle East and Africa the rate was 10.6%. More significantly, the report highlighted the importance of what it describes as the “hidden payments” market, namely payments undertaken by means of closed loop cards and mobile apps, digital wallets offered by non-banks, mobile money offered by non-banks and virtual currencies.
 
The key drivers for these alternative payment methods is the consumers demand for convenient payment transactions with less friction. The gaps in the existing value propositions offered by the banks mainly because of legacy systems and regulatory constraints, which can stifle innovation and the inability of many consumers to access the banks’ traditional payment services. In a growing electronic payments market, these alternative payment methods are therefore perceived by the industry as an important route for both innovation and financial inclusion.

Growth Strategy 
 
With the acquisitions of MultiPay (2015) and FIN (2016), the Company has acquired not only innovative technology, but existing products, revenues and a customer base upon which the Company can build. We seek to extend our position and execute our business plan by continuing to penetrate our existing markets and expand into new geographies and market segments. Our goal is to continue to deliver innovative security and payment services to our customers that help them achieve their operational or business goals. The execution of our strategy is subject to our obtaining sufficient additional working capital to finance the various initiatives discussed, whether through investment or otherwise. The key components of our strategy are discussed below.
 
Cross sell to existing customers
 
The Company is examining opportunities to offer its new platform capabilities and solutions to existing customers. Tokenization of transactions is also a secure processing methodology that has numerous applications across different customer use cases. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create a platform that combines our identity management technology with our payment processing capabilities, and thereby, have a more complete offering for customers that are ultimately using only one of those services.
 
Add new customers
 
The Company plans to grow its core business through focused sales and marketing of its current products and solutions, as well as its newly developed platforms and solutions. We are recruiting sales, marketing and product teams who will be tasked with developing additional distribution channels and seeking out new customers.
 
Enter new markets
 
By virtue of the acquisitions mentioned above, the Company has already entered new markets in Colombia and South Africa. The Company believes that the solutions that are currently being offered and developed in those countries will be suitable to be similarly offered in other emerging markets in the Latin American and African regions. Furthermore, the improvements to the Company’s platforms and the expansion of the sales teams are being undertaken with a view to being able to support transaction processing and customers across borders without the need to establish and build new facilities in each new country, thereby reducing the costs of entry into each new market. 
 
Innovation
 
As the electronic and cybersecurity industry continues to evolve, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new services and solutions that leverage our platform and core competencies and thereby enable us to enter new markets, attract new customers and retain existing ones. We also believe it will be critical to our growth for us to continue to enhance our platform capabilities. We believe the development of new services and solutions will be an important revenue source in the future, and enable us to continue to differentiate our platform and capabilities. For example, a key offering recently launched in pilot is our identity authentication products. In addition, we believe that with the massive increase in transaction originated by devices as a result of the growth of the Internet of Things (IOT) that business and consumers alike will ultimately need more control over device originated electronic transactions, which we intend to support with our platform. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create solutions that address some of today’s major global market challenges and opportunities arising in identity management and access control, coupled with the ubiquitous use of mobile devices. By combining our core technologies, we aim to build an identity transaction platform using biometric and multi-factor identity management solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions.

Select Acquisitions
 
As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
Channel Strategy
 
The Company believes that its channel strategy will be an effective way to bring its products and solutions to a broad market in an efficient and cost effective way. We are in discussions with a number of potential channel partners, that play a key role in their respective verticals, such as a technology provider for banks and a logistics company for the trucking industry. These channel partners provide access to their customers, who in turn work with many thousands of individual consumers and businesses all of whom could benefit from the use of our solutions. By entering into agreements with such channel partners and leveraging their relationships, we believe we can expand our footprint much more rapidly and cost effectively, as compared to entering into separate agreements with each customer. 
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has conducted limited marketing to date. The Company anticipates that it will engage in marketing activities in connection with the launch of our new solutions. The primary focus of marketing campaigns will be designed to help the Company find new customers and to increase awareness of the Company’s products and platform.
 
The Company expects that its sales team will work closely with the marketing team to convert prospects into new customers. The sales team will be structured to align with target markets based on territory.

Revenue Model
 
Identity Management Solutions and Products
 
The biometric solutions are priced based on a multi-year licensing model which is driven by the number of enrollees in the system. The Company expects to provide its new platform service for identity management transactions based on a subscription model, based on tiered fees per enrolled user, card or device. The Company’s CardPlus plastic and credentials card products are sold at a per unit price which will vary based on the configuration of the features and functionality of the product, as well as the services provided.
Payment Processing Solutions and Products
 
The electronic payment gateway services are volume priced on a per transaction basis. The pricing for the Company’s new closed loop financial payment platform is expected to be based on a combination of transaction fee and a subscription model based on numbers of cardholders and merchants enrolled. The Company also earns leasing income from the rental of unattended kiosks.
Competition

The identification management and payment processing industries are characterized by rapid change and new entrants. The Company will need to consistently develop and improve products in order to remain competitive in the technology industry.
 
Several competitors exist for the Company’s current and planned products and platform services relating to the identity management and electronic payment transaction markets. The competitive landscape includes several companies that address one or the other area, with some addressing both areas independently.
 
To further analyze the competitive landscape, the identity management market must be segmented into out-of band authentication and biometric identification & verification solution providers. Major competitors offering solutions in both areas include IDEMIA, Gemalto, HID Global, Aware, and SuperCom. Major competitors offering only out-of band authentication, include Twillio/Authy, HYPR, Datacard, Duo, Daon, Trusona, and ID.ME. Companies offering only biometric identification & verification include NEC, Imageware, Element, and Veridium. There are new entrants into each of these markets continually. Each competitor may have a different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some competitors also include manufacturers who provide systems, or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems.
  
The Ipsidy identity management transaction platform is being developed based on a patent-pending methodology, which integrates digital signature authentication and vetted biometric identity verification delivered through an out-of-band transaction. The Company anticipates that when completed this could provide functionality for users to have real-time control over their electronic transactions through a mobile application, with a detailed audit trail created for each transaction, containing the digitally signed transaction details and biometric identity. This patent-pending approach of combining transaction details and identity into a single, digitally signed message could allow the Ipsidy platform to be a complimentary solution to many of its competitors and hence differentiate itself in the market. More specifically, the platform is designed to be able to leverage third party biometric identification and verification solutions, thereby creating the opportunity to partner with companies already offering those capabilities.
 
The Cards Plus business faces competition both locally in South Africa and internationally. China has become a source of imports of card products at highly competitive pricing and some local suppliers are reliant on Chinese card manufacturers Local competitors include Card Technology Services, Easy Card and Open Gate, Cardz Group and XH Smart Technology (Africa). That said, we believe that we are the only significant manufacturer in South Africa using digital print technology.
 
The payment processing industry has many competitors who provide gateway services, closed loop end-to-end solutions, payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and bill payments. As these types of services are usually supplied by regional or country specific companies, the following is a breakdown of this competitive landscape, specifically in those countries or regions the Company is actively pursuing business in today. In Colombia, major competitors include PayU, Nequi, Daviplata and QPagos.

While the Company will take steps to protect and maintain its intellectual property and competitive designs, there is no guarantee that such steps can safeguard against the rapid technological changes and innovation in industries in which we operate.
 
In addition, it is possible that other technology companies could develop competing technology and products. Many of our competitors are much larger organizations that typically have larger sales, marketing and R&D budgets, more financial, technical customer support and other resources, greater brand recognition and the ability to hire talented personnel to more quickly develop and commercialize new products. There are no assurances the Company will ever be able to compete in its target markets.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company does not need or require any approval from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular business and operations. However, it is possible that any proposed expansion to the Company’s business and operations in the future would require government approvals.
 
Due to the security applications and biometric technology associated with the Company’s products and platforms, the activities and operations of the Company are subject to license restrictions and other regulations, such as (without limitation) export controls and other security regulation by government agencies. Expansion of the Company’s activities in payment processing may in due course require government licensing in different jurisdictions and may subject it to additional regulation and oversight.
 
Data protection legislation in various countries in which the Company does business (including Colombia and the United Kingdom) may require it to register its databases with governmental authorities in those countries and to comply with additional disclosure and consent requirements with regard to the collection, storage and use of personal information of individuals resident in those countries.
 
Employees and Organization
 
The Company, as of December 31, 2017, had a total of 71 employees as well as outsourced service providers that are located in three countries: South Africa, Colombia, and the United States. Beginning in 2017, employees in the U.S. started receiving health benefits on a cost sharing basis and employees in Colombia and South Africa are provided the respective Government required benefits. The Company may enhance or offer additional fringe and welfare benefits in the future as the Company’s profits grow and/or the Company secures additional outside financing.
Subsidiaries
 
Currently, the Company has three U.S. subsidiaries: Innovation in Motion Inc., Fin Holdings, Inc., and ID Solutions Inc. The Company has three subsidiaries in Colombia: MultiPay S.A.S., IDGS LATAM S.A.S., and IDGS S.A.S..The Company has one subsidiary in South Africa: CardsPlus Pty Ltd. The Company has one subsidiary in the United Kingdom: Ipsidy Enterprises Limited. The Company is the sole shareholder of all of its subsidiaries.
