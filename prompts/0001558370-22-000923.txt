ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Development of Business
O-I Glass, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), through its subsidiaries, is the successor to a business established in 1903. The Company is one of the leading manufacturers of glass containers in the world with 70 glass manufacturing plants in 19 countries. It competes in the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market and is the leading glass container manufacturer in most of the countries where it has manufacturing facilities.
The term “Company,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refers to Owens-Illinois, Inc. and its affiliates (“O-I”) prior to the Corporate Modernization (as defined below) and to O-I Glass, Inc. and its affiliates (“O-I Glass”) after the Corporate Modernization.
Corporate Modernization and Paddock’s Chapter 11 Filing
On December 26 and 27, 2019, the Company implemented the Corporate Modernization pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of December 26, 2019, among O-I, O-I Glass and Paddock Enterprises, LLC (“Paddock”).
The Corporate Modernization was conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which permits the creation of a holding company through a merger with a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation without stockholder approval. The Corporate Modernization involved a series of transactions (together with certain related transactions, the “Corporate Modernization”) pursuant to which (1) O-I formed a new holding company, O-I Glass, as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I and a sister company to Owens-Illinois Group, Inc. (“O-I Group”), (2) O-I Glass formed a new Delaware limited liability company, Paddock, as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I Glass, (3) O-I merged with and into Paddock, with Paddock continuing as the surviving entity and as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I Glass (the “Merger”) and (4) Paddock distributed 100% of the capital stock of O-I Group to O-I Glass, as a result of which O-I Group is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I Glass and sister company to Paddock.
Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each share of O-I stock held immediately prior to the Merger automatically converted into a right to receive an equivalent corresponding share of O-I Glass stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions as the corresponding share of O-I stock being converted. Immediately after the Corporate Modernization, O-I Glass had, on a consolidated basis, the same assets, businesses and operations as O-I had immediately prior to the Corporate Modernization. After the Corporate Modernization, O-I’s share owners became share owners of O-I Glass. The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and as a result, the stockholders of O-I do not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their O-I shares. 
On January 6, 2020, Paddock voluntarily filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) to equitably and finally resolve all of its current and future Asbestos Claims (as defined herein). O-I Glass and O-I Group were not included in the Chapter 11 filing. Paddock’s ultimate goal in its Chapter 11 case is to confirm a plan of reorganization under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code and utilize this specialized provision to establish a trust that will address all current and future Asbestos Claims. Paddock now operates in the ordinary course under court protection from Asbestos Claims by operation of the automatic stay in Paddock’s Chapter 11 filing, which stays ongoing litigation and submission of claims to Paddock, defers payment of outstanding obligations on account of settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and will provide a 

1



centralized forum to resolve presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos.
For a discussion of the effects of the Corporate Modernization and Paddock’s Chapter 11 proceedings on the Company’s financial statements, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Corporate Modernization,” Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 15 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

​
Reportable Segments
Historically, the Company had three reportable segments based on its geographic locations: Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. These three reportable segments are aligned with the Company’s internal approach to managing, reporting, and evaluating performance of its global glass operations. 
On July 31, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its Australia and New Zealand (“ANZ”) businesses, which comprised the majority of its businesses in the Asia Pacific region (approximately 85% of net sales in that region for the full year 2019), to Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd. (“Visy”).  After the sale of the ANZ businesses, the remaining businesses in the Asia Pacific region do not meet the criteria of an individually reportable segment. Thus, after 2020, the Company no longer reports results for the Asia Pacific reportable 

2



segment. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the results for the Asia Pacific reportable segment reflect only the results of the ANZ businesses. The sales and operating results of the other businesses that historically comprised the Asia Pacific segment, and that have been retained by the Company, have been reclassified to Other sales and Retained corporate costs and other, respectively.
Products and Services
The Company produces glass containers for alcoholic beverages, including beer, flavored malt beverages, spirits and wine. The Company also produces glass packaging for a variety of food items, soft drinks, teas, juices and pharmaceuticals. The Company manufactures glass containers in a wide range of sizes, shapes and colors and is active in new product development and glass container innovation.
Customers
In most of the countries where the Company competes, it has the leading position in the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market based on sales revenue. The Company’s largest customers consist mainly of the leading global food and beverage manufacturers, including (in alphabetical order) Anheuser-Busch InBev, Brown-Forman, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Constellation, Diageo, Heineken, Molson Coors, Nestle, PepsiCo and Pernod Ricard. 
The Company sells most of its glass container products directly to customers under annual or multi-year supply agreements. Multi-year contracts typically provide for price adjustments based on cost changes. The Company also sells some of its products through distributors. Many customers provide the Company with regular estimates of their product needs, which enables the Company to schedule glass container production to maintain reasonable levels of inventory. Glass container manufacturing facilities are generally located in close proximity to customers.
Sales and Markets
The Company’s principal markets for glass container products are in the Americas and Europe with select operations remaining in the Asia Pacific region after the sale of its ANZ businesses.
Americas. The Company has 34 glass container manufacturing plants in the Americas region located in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and the U.S. and interests in three joint ventures that manufacture glass containers. Also, the Company has a distribution facility in the U.S. used to import glass containers from its business in Mexico. The Company has the leading share of the glass container segment of the U.S. rigid packaging market, based on sales revenue by domestic producers. In South America and Mexico, the Company maintains a diversified portfolio serving several markets, including alcoholic beverages (beer, wine and spirits), non-alcoholic beverages and food, as well as a large infrastructure for returnable/refillable glass containers. 
The principal glass container competitors in the U.S. are the Ardagh Group and Anchor Glass Container. Imports from China, Mexico, Taiwan and other countries also compete in U.S. glass container segments. Additionally, there are several major consumer packaged goods companies that self-manufacture glass containers. The Company competes directly with Verallia in Brazil, and does not believe that it competes with any other large, multinational glass container manufacturers in the rest of the region. 
Europe. The Company is one of the leaders in the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market in the European countries in which it operates, with 34 glass container manufacturing plants located in the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. These plants primarily produce glass containers for the alcoholic beverages (beer, wine and spirits), non-alcoholic beverages and food markets in these countries. The Company also has interests in two joint ventures that manufacture glass containers in Italy. Throughout Europe, the Company competes directly with a variety of glass container manufacturers including Verallia, Ardagh Group, Vetropack, Vidrala and BA Vidro.

3



Asia Pacific. After 2020, the Company no longer reports results for the Asia Pacific reportable segment due to the sale of most of this segment. On July 31, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its ANZ businesses, which comprised the majority of its businesses in the Asia Pacific region (approximately 85% of net sales in that region for the full year 2019), to Visy.  After the sale of the ANZ businesses, the remaining businesses in the Asia Pacific region, which consist of two plants and a joint venture, do not meet the criteria of an individually reportable segment.
In addition to competing with other large and well-established manufacturers in the glass container segment, the Company competes in all regions with manufacturers of other forms of rigid packaging, principally aluminum cans and plastic containers. Competition is based on quality, price, service, innovation and the marketing attributes of the container. The principal competitors producing metal containers include Ardagh Group, Ball Corporation, Crown Holdings, Inc., CANPACK and Silgan Holdings Inc. The principal competitors producing plastic containers include Amcor, Consolidated Container Holdings, LLC, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, Plastipak Packaging, Inc. and Silgan Holdings Inc. The Company also competes with manufacturers of non-rigid packaging alternatives, including flexible pouches, aseptic cartons and bag-in-box containers.
The Company seeks to provide products and services to customers ranging from large multinationals to small local breweries and wineries in a way that creates a competitive advantage for the Company. The Company believes that it is often the glass container partner of choice because of its innovation and branding capabilities, its global footprint and its expertise in manufacturing know-how and process technology.
Seasonality 
Sales of many glass container products such as beer, beverages and food are seasonal. Shipments in North America and Europe are typically greater in the second and third quarters of the year, while shipments in Latin America are typically greater in the third and fourth quarters of the year. 
​
Manufacturing
The Company has 70 glass manufacturing plants. It constantly seeks to improve the productivity of these operations through the systematic upgrading of production capabilities, sharing of best practices among plants and effective training of employees.
The Company also provides engineering support for its glass manufacturing operations through facilities located in the U.S., Poland and Peru.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used in the Company’s glass container operations are sand, soda ash, limestone and recycled glass. Each of these materials, as well as the other raw materials used to manufacture glass containers, have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.
Energy
The Company’s glass container operations require a continuous supply of significant amounts of energy, principally natural gas, fuel oil and electrical power. Adequate supplies of energy are generally available at all of the Company’s manufacturing locations. Energy costs typically account for 10% to 20% of the Company’s total manufacturing costs, depending on the cost of energy, the type of energy available, the factory location and the particular energy requirements. The percentage of total cost related to energy can vary significantly because of volatility in market prices, particularly for natural gas and fuel oil in volatile markets such as North America and Europe.
In the Americas’ businesses in the U.S. and Canada, more than 90% of the sales volume is represented by customer contracts that contain provisions that pass the commodity price of natural gas to the customer, effectively reducing the region’s exposure to changing natural gas market prices. In the Americas’ businesses in South America and Mexico, there is a combination of fixed price contracts, as well as energy pricing linked to variable commodities pricing. Also, in these countries, customer contracts generally allow for annual price adjustments for inflation, variability in energy costs, and foreign currency variation.

In Europe, the Company enters into long-term contracts for a significant amount of its energy requirements. These contracts have terms that range from one to five years. 
Research, Development and Engineering
Research, development and engineering constitute important parts of the Company’s technical and sustainability activities. The Company’s research and development activities are conducted principally at its corporate facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio. The Company primarily focuses on advancements in the areas of product innovation, manufacturing process control, melting technology, automatic inspection, light-weighting and further automation of manufacturing activities. 
The Company has increased its focus on advancing melting technology with investments in modular glass melting furnaces. The Company’s investments in this new technology, known as the MAGMA program, seek to reduce the amount of capital required to install, rebuild and operate its furnaces. This new melting technology is also focused on the ability of these assets to be more easily turned on and off or adjusted based on seasonality, address sustainability issues and transition opportunities for lower-carbon intensity of manufacturing processes, and meet customer demands. 
Beginning in 2022, the Company intends to increase its capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment to expand the business, including to begin deploying its new MAGMA technology. The Company is implementing its MAGMA program using a multi-generation development roadmap. Generation 1 (“Gen 1”) is primarily focused on a novel and improved way to melt glass. Gen 1 was successfully piloted in 2018 in Streator, Illinois, and the Company started the first full-scale manufacturing line during the first half of 2021 in Holzminden, Germany. The Company’s Gen 1 solution has achieved its expectations. Generation 2 (“Gen 2”) will add new production capabilities, such as a flexible batch system, improved forming technology, and modular inspection and packaging equipment, representing a complete end-to-end integrated production system. The piloting of key components is already in progress and the Company expects Gen 2 to be ready for deployment in 2023. Generation 3 (“Gen 3”) is the ultimate evolution of MAGMA that combines a modular, end-to-end system with optimized processes and capabilities. It is expected to include light-weighting technology along with other advancements in sustainability – for example, the utilization of renewable energy sources and a broader range of recycled glass materials to enable increased recycled content rates. Overall, the Company is pleased with its progress on Gen 3 as many of the key elements are in place and the invention of other capabilities is going well. The Company expects Gen 3 will be available for deployment in 2025. 
The Company holds a large number of patents related to a wide variety of products and processes and has a substantial number of patent applications pending.

​
Sustainability/ESG and Workplace Safety 
The Company is committed to sustainability and ESG issues, including striving to reduce the impact its products and operations have on the environment and increase positive impacts. As part of this commitment, the Company has expanded its sustainability initiatives and set additional sustainability targets, including targets for increasing the use of recycled glass in its manufacturing process, decreasing water consumption and waste, reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2”) emissions, increasing the use of renewable energy, and supporting community needs. The Company has aligned its sustainability ambitions with certain United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
Some specific examples of steps taken by the Company to advance sustainability and ESG issues include: assigning responsibility for ESG and sustainability oversight to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, appointing a Chief Sustainability Officer who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, establishing a global sustainability leadership network, obtaining an approved science-based emissions reduction target, increasing the use of renewable energy, lowering emissions, investing in sustainable manufacturing technology and container design, using green bond financing and working with governments and other organizations to establish and financially support recycling initiatives.

The Company’s worldwide operations, in addition to other companies within the industry, are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties, as well as water discharges, air emissions, waste management and workplace health and safety. The Company strives to abide by and uphold such laws and regulations.
Glass Recycling, Deposit Return Systems, and Extended Producer Responsibility
The Company is an important contributor to recycling efforts worldwide and is among the largest users of recycled glass. If sufficient high-quality recycled glass were available on a consistent basis, the Company has the technology to make glass containers containing a high proportion of recycled glass. Using recycled glass in the manufacturing process reduces CO2 emissions, reduces energy consumption and cost, and positively impacts the operating life and efficiency of the glass melting furnaces. The Company actively partners with other entities throughout the value chain to improve the effectiveness of recycling efforts and the availability of recycled glass. 
In the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere, government authorities have adopted or are considering legal requirements, including Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) frameworks. EPR and other packaging recycling regulations may impose fees, mandate certain recycling rates, require minimum use of recycled materials, or result in limitations on or preferences for certain types of packaging. The Company believes that governments worldwide will continue to develop and enact legal requirements guiding customer and end-consumer packaging choices.
Sales of beverage containers are affected by governmental regulation of packaging, including deposit-return system (“DRS”) laws and EPR regulations. As of December 31, 2021, there were a number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces and territories and European countries with some form of legal regulation that imposes fees on producers or consumers of various packaging, including glass containers. The structure and enforcement of such laws and regulations can impact the sales of the Company’s products in a given jurisdiction. Such laws and regulations also impact the availability of post-consumer recycled glass for the Company to use in container production.
Countries, states, and localities in all geographies in which the Company operates have recently considered or are now considering new EPR regulations, various laws and regulations to change curbside recycling, modify or create DRS laws, and create alternatives to traditional recycling systems. Although there is no clear trend, the Company believes these legal and regulatory activities have the potential to materially impact the price and supply of recycled glass. As a large user of recycled glass for making new glass containers, the Company has an interest in laws and regulations impacting the supply of such material in its markets.
Climate Change and Air Emissions 
A number of governments globally are increasingly considering a variety of mandatory regulatory and legal requirements or voluntary initiatives (e.g. Paris Climate Accord) in relation to climate-change or environmental issues. The Company is unable to predict what climate-change or environmental legal requirements may be adopted in the future, although is aware that the trend is for more restrictive environmental and climate-related legislation to be introduced. The Company continually monitors its operations in relation to material climate-change risks and environmental impact, has set environmental and climate-related goals and invests in environmentally friendly and emissions-reducing projects. As such, the Company has made significant expenditures for environmental improvements at certain of its facilities over the last several years; however, these expenditures did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company is unable to predict the impact of future environmental legal requirements on its results of operations or cash flows.
In Europe, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme is a regulatory regime that facilitates emissions reductions in the EU. The Company’s manufacturing facilities that operate in EU countries that are subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme must surrender an amount of emissions allowances equal to the volume of their CO2 emissions and if emissions exceed permitted volumes and allowances, purchase allowances in the market. Should the regulators significantly restrict the total number of emissions allowances available in the market, or 

6



significantly reduce the number of allowances freely allocated to the Company’s EU plants, it could have a material effect on the Company’s results.
In the Americas, the U.S. and Canada have engaged in significant legislative, regulatory and enforcement activities relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for years at the federal, state and provincial levels of government. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) regulates emissions of GHG air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, which grants the EPA authority to establish limits for certain air pollutants and to require compliance, levy penalties and bring civil judicial action against violators. The EPA’s GHG regulations continue to evolve, as the structure and scope of the regulations are often the subject of litigation and federal legislative activity. New GHG regulations in any country or state in the U.S. where the Company operates could have a significant long-term material impact on the Company’s operations that are affected by such regulations. The state of California in the U.S., the Canadian federal government and the province of Quebec have adopted cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing GHG emissions, and other U.S. jurisdictions have elected to participate in this and other cap-and-trade programs. In Mexico and other South American countries, national and local governments are also considering potential regulations to reduce GHG emissions.
 For a further discussion of the effects of sustainability, climate-change and ESG on the Company’s business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters, Sustainability and Climate Change” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Workplace Safety
In the U.S., the Company is subject to various state and federal regulatory agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), that assure safe and healthy working conditions by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance. Similar regulatory agencies focused on employee safety exist in other countries in which the Company operates around the world. 
The Company is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees, as well as contractors and visitors in all of the Company’s facilities. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified, and management tracks incidents so that remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
The Company is unable to predict what workplace safety legal requirements may be adopted in the future. However, the Company continually monitors its operations in relation to workplace safety and invests in projects to enhance employee safety. As such, the Company has made significant expenditures on workplace safety improvements at certain of its facilities over the last several years; however, these expenditures did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company expects to see continued improvement in health and safety as a result of these projects. The Company is unable to predict the impact of future health and safety legal requirements on its results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital Resources
The Company’s success and performance are directly related to the collective success and performance of every employee. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of its employees significantly benefit the Company’s operations and performance. The Company has approximately 24,000 employees and 70 plants spread across 19 countries. 
The Company’s core values of safety, diversity, accountability, integrity, teamwork, passion, and excellence drive its behaviors. Led by its people’s knowledge and ambition, the Company is innovating to meet its customers’ ever-evolving needs to help build their brands and become valued partners. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, the Company seeks to provide a safe, inclusive, diverse, motivating and collaborative work environment with opportunities for its employees to grow and develop in their careers, supports employees 

7



through strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and identifies programs that strive to build connections between its employees and their communities.
The Company is committed to a culture of respect and integrity and believes it is better when its workforce reflects the diversity of the world it serves, leading to a broader range of perspectives that may yield superior decisions and outcomes. As part of the Company’s journey, one of its goals is to create an environment where employees can bring their whole selves to work, to share new ideas and innovate, and in turn, enhance their overall experience and overall well-being and the performance of the Company. 
The Company seeks to make strategic investments into developing employees and the talent pipeline. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees with the assistance of third-party consultants, and seeks to identify relevant actions to address any areas of employee concern. 
A significant portion of the Company’s employees in the Americas are hourly workers covered by collective bargaining agreements. In Europe, a large number of the Company’s employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require the Company to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good and does not anticipate any material work stoppages in the near term.
 The Company operates as one enterprise, and believes that it prioritizes boundaryless leadership and sound decision making, and that it operates with one plan, delivering customer-centric results. These efforts, combined with its values and behaviors, advances the Company’s ambition to be a simple, agile, and performance-based organization energized by diverse, engaged employees. ​
