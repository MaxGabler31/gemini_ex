ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development
Highwater Ethanol, LLC (“we,” “our,” “Highwater Ethanol” or the “Company”) was formed as a Minnesota limited liability company on May 2, 2006 for the purpose of constructing, owning, and operating a 50 million gallon per year ethanol plant near Lamberton, Minnesota. Since August 2009, we have been engaged in the production of ethanol and distillers grains at the plant. We have been operating at an annual rate of approximately 58.5 million gallons for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 and anticipate we will continue to operate at a similar rate. However, we have submitted an application to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to increase the emissions limits in our air permit to allow 70.2 million gallons of production per year. As such, we anticipate that we may increase our production in the future once our application is approved.
Financial Information
Please refer to “ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities and “ITEM 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our financial statements and supplementary data. 
Principal Products
The principal products we currently produce at the ethanol plant are fuel-grade ethanol and distillers grains. In addition, we are extracting corn oil for sale. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributed to each of our products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2018 | | Fiscal Year 2017 | | Fiscal Year 2016
Ethanol | 77 | % | | 82 | % | 79 | %
Distillers Grains | 20 | % | | 15 | % | 18 | %
Corn Oil | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %

Ethanol
Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. The ethanol we produce is manufactured from corn. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and
provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. As of September 30, 2018, the Renewable Fuels Association estimated capacity for domestic ethanol production at approximately 16.4 billion gallons with approximately 3% of that capacity idled.
An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called “beer,” which contains about 10% alcohol and 90% water. The “beer” is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant to make the product unfit for human consumption and commercially saleable.

Ethanol can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Approximately 95% of all ethanol is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Used as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol provides a means to control carbon monoxide emissions in large metropolitan areas. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally the wholesale gasoline marketer or blender.
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, poultry, swine and beef industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distiller grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles (“DWS”), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles (“DMWS”) and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (“DDGS”). DWS is processed corn mash that contains approximately 70% moisture. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the immediate vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture. DMWS has a slightly longer shelf life of approximately ten days and is often sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS that has been dried to between 10% and 12% moisture. DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to an ethanol plant.
Corn Oil

Since April 2014, we have been separating some of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses.
Ethanol, Distillers Grains and Corn Oil Markets
As described below in “Distribution Methods” we market and distribute a majority of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil through professional third party marketers. Our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil marketers make decisions with regard to where our products are marketed. 
Our ethanol and distillers grains are primarily sold in the domestic market, however, as domestic production of ethanol and distillers grains continue to expand, we anticipate increased international sales of ethanol and distillers grains. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically.
Over the past fiscal year, exports of ethanol have increased with Brazil and Canada receiving large amounts of ethanol produced in the United States. China, India, the Philippines and South Korea have also been top destinations. However, tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States and the potential for the imposition of tariffs by other countries due to trade disputes with the United States, may reduce overall ethanol export demand which could have a negative effect on domestic ethanol prices. In addition, export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand.
Historically, the United States ethanol industry has exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China. The imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by China over the past two years has resulted in a significant decline in demand from China requiring United States producers to seek out alternative markets. Over the past year, export markets have become increasingly diversified with Turkey, Mexico and South Korea receiving significant amounts of distillers grains produced in the United States and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Canada receiving notable amounts. However recent trade disputes with foreign governments have created additional uncertainty as to future export demand.
All of the corn oil we produce is marketed and distributed in the domestic market.
Distribution Methods
Ethanol
We have an exclusive marketing agreement with RPMG, Inc. (“RPMG”) for the purposes of marketing and distributing our ethanol. Because we are an owner of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC (“RPMG LLC”), the parent entity of RPMG, our ethanol marketing fees are based on RPMG's cost to market our ethanol. Further, as an owner, we share in the profits and losses generated by RPMG when it markets products for other producers who are not owners of RPMG LLC. Our marketing agreement provides that we can sell our ethanol either through an index arrangement or at an agreed upon fixed price. The term of our marketing agreement is perpetual until terminated according to its terms. The primary reasons for termination would be if 
5

we cease to be an owner of RPMG LLC, if there is a breach which is not cured, or if we give advance notice to RPMG that we wish to terminate. Notwithstanding our right to terminate, we may be obligated to continue to market our ethanol through RPMG for a period of time after termination. Further, following termination, we agree to accept an assignment of certain railcar leases which RPMG has secured to service us. If the marketing agreement is terminated, it would trigger a redemption of our ownership interest in RPMG LLC. 
Distillers Grains
We have a distillers grains marketing agreement with CHS, Inc. ("CHS") to market all the dried distillers grains we produce at the plant. Under the agreement, CHS charges a maximum of $2.00 per ton and a minimum of $1.50 per ton price using 2% of the FOB plant price actually received by CHS for all dried distillers grains removed by CHS from our plant. The agreement will remain in effect unless otherwise terminated by either party with 120 days notice. Under the agreement, CHS is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our dried distillers grains. 
We market and sell our own distillers modified wet grains with solubles.
Corn Oil
We previously had a corn oil marketing agreement with CHS wherein CHS purchased and marketed all crude corn oil produced at the plant. Our agreement with CHS terminated on November 19, 2018 and we have transitioned to RPMG as our exclusive corn oil marketer. We pay RPMG a marketing fee. We may immediately terminate our agreement with RPMG upon written notice if: (1) RPMG fails on three separate occasions within a 12-month period to purchase corn oil or market corn oil, as not otherwise excused under the Agreement; or (2) upon RPMG's insolvency. RPMG may immediately terminate the agreement upon written notice if: (A) during any consecutive three (3) months the actual production or inventory of any corn oil product at the plant varies by twenty (20%) or more from the monthly production and inventory estimates provided to RPMG (other than for reasons permitted under the RPMG Agreement); or (B) upon our insolvency.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
Corn Feedstock Supply
The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol and distillers grains is corn. To produce 59.5 million gallons of ethanol per year, our ethanol plant needs approximately 20.5 million bushels of corn, or approximately 56,000 bushels of corn per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. 
Since July 2016, we procured corn from CHS pursuant to a grain origination agreement (the "CHS Agreement"). In that agreement, we agreed to buy from CHS all of our requirements for feedstock grain meeting certain specifications. The CHS Agreement was for an initial five-year term which commenced on July 27, 2016. The CHS Agreement automatically renewed for successive one-year terms unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. The CHS Agreement could also be terminated in the event of a breach by either party after a thirty-day notice of the breach and opportunity to cure. Under the CHS Agreement, we notified CHS of our grain requirements, including volume and delivery dates, on or before the first and fifteenth day of each month. We then provide to CHS a daily bid sheet for grain to be sold to the Company and CHS purchased the grain by separate purchase contracts at the basis prices, quantities and guidelines identified in the bid sheet using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the lowest price available. All sales of grain by CHS were done by separate sales contracts requiring delivery of grain to the Company at the facility. We paid CHS the CBOT futures price less the weighted average of the basis prices plus a fixed fee per bushel of grain purchased. On January 3, 2019, we mutually agreed to terminate the CHS effective as of midnight January 31, 2019 (the "Termination Date"). We are obligated to purchase and pay the per bushel fee on bushels of grain currently contracted by CHS to be delivered following the Termination Date. In exchange for termination of the CHS Agreement, we agreed not to contract with another entity or company for grain procurement services until after July 26, 2021 and granted CHS a right of first refusal to serve as the Company's procurement agent until July 1, 2021. We intend to procure our own corn following termination of our arrangement with CHS. 
The price at which we purchase corn depends on prevailing market prices. Increases in the price of corn significantly increase our cost of goods sold. If these increases in cost of goods sold are not offset by corresponding increases in the prices we receive from the sale of our products, these increases in cost of goods sold can have a significant negative impact on our financial performance. 
On November 8, 2018, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") released a report estimating the 2018 corn crop at 14.6 billion bushels, up less than 1% from last year's production, with yields averaging 178.9 bushels per acre. The USDA 
6

forecasted area harvested for grain at 81.8 million acres, down 1% from 2017. As a result, management expects that corn prices will be steady to higher during the winter of 2018. However, weather, world supply and demand, current and anticipated stocks, agricultural policy and other factors can contribute to volatility in corn prices. 
Utilities
Natural Gas
Natural gas is an important input to our manufacturing process. We use natural gas to dry our distillers grains products to moisture contents at which they can be stored for longer periods. This allows the distillers grains we produce to be transported greater distances to serve broader livestock markets. 

We have access to an existing Northern Natural Gas Company interstate natural gas pipeline located approximately one half mile from our ethanol plant. On July 30, 2018, we entered into an Amendment to TFX Throughput Service Agreement with Northern Natural Gas Company. The amendment has an effective date of November 1, 2019 and extends the term through October 31, 2024. Under the amendment, we will pay NNG the tariff rate in effect from time to time for natural gas. NNG has allocated a minimum quantity of 5,000 dekatherms ("dth") of natural gas per day.
We entered into a natural gas service agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., d.b.a. CenterPoint Energy Minnesota Gas (“CenterPoint”) which will expire on October 31, 2019. CenterPoint constructed a pipeline for us from the Northern Natural Gas Company Town Border Station. We purchase all of our natural gas requirements from CenterPoint's pipeline. We have entered into a new agreement with CenterPoint which will become effective on November 1, 2019. Under the agreement, CenterPoint will continue to operate and maintain the pipeline to deliver natural gas to us under applicable tariffs.  In addition, for all natural gas volumes delivered, we will pay certain delivery charges per dth delivered during each contract year subject to annual adjustments as permitted by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to match actual costs with the value recovered in the rates. In the event we do not purchase the minimum volume of 1,400,000 dth during each contract year, we will pay the difference between the actual delivery volume for the period and the minimum volume multiplied by the applicable rate. The initial term of the agreement will continue until October 31, 2029 and will automatically renew for additional five year terms unless terminated by either party upon written notice given at least 12 months prior to the end of the term upon an occurrence of certain events of default as set forth therein.
We also have an energy management agreement with Kinect Energy Group f/k/a U.S. Energy Services, Inc. (“Kinect”) pursuant to which Kinect is providing us with the necessary natural gas management services. Some of their services may include an economic comparison of distribution service options, negotiation and minimization of interconnect costs, submission of the necessary pipeline “tap” request, supplying the plant with and/or negotiating the procurement of natural gas, development and implementation of a price risk management plan targeted at mitigating natural gas price volatility and maintaining profitability, providing consolidated monthly invoices that reflect all natural gas costs. In addition, Kinect is responsible for reviewing and reconciling all invoices. In exchange for these services, we pay Kinect a monthly retainer fee. 
We do not anticipate any problems securing the natural gas we need to operate our ethanol plant during our 2019 fiscal year. 
Electricity
On June 28, 2007, we entered into an agreement for electric service with Redwood Electric Cooperative, Inc., (the "Cooperative") for the purchase and delivery of electric power and energy necessary to operate our ethanol plant. Upon execution of the agreement, we became a member of the Cooperative and are bound by its articles of incorporation and bylaws. This agreement remained in effect until September 19, 2017, when our new agreement with the Cooperative to purchase all of the electric power that we require for our ethanol plant became effective. The new agreement remains in effect until January 1, 2023. The agreement automatically renews for additional five year periods unless we give at least one year's written notice of termination prior to the expiration of the then current term or if the agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. For the electric power provided, in addition to certain penalties and adjustments, we will pay the following rates: (i) a facility charge based on the then current net plant value; (ii) a per KWh energy charge at the then current wholesale rate including distribution losses and margin requirements; (iii) an additional demand charge for the entire monthly demand (kW) that is coincident to the peak demand; and (iv) an additional delivery charge for the entire monthly demand (kW) that is coincident to the peak demand. The rates are updated annually. The rates set forth in the agreement terminate in the event that our firm non-coincident peak demand is less that 2,000 kW for twelve consecutive months or our rolling twelve month non-coincident load factor is less than 60% for twelve consecutive months. Upon termination of the agreement by either party for any reason, we remain responsible for payment of the facility charge for what would have been the remaining portion of the term.

We do not anticipate any problems securing the electricity we need to operate our ethanol plant during our 2019 fiscal year. 
Water
We require a significant supply of water. We currently obtain water from a high capacity well and through a pipeline that pipes water from a nearby rock quarry. However, during our 2015 fiscal year, we commenced a project to install a water pipeline to add an additional water source for our plant. This project was completed during the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year. We acquired all of the necessary permits required for our water usage. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the process. There are, however, certain areas of production where fresh water is needed. Those areas include the boiler makeup water and cooling tower water. Boiler makeup water is treated on-site to minimize all elements that will harm the boiler and recycled water cannot be used for this process. Cooling tower water is deemed non-contact water because it does not come in contact with the mash, and, therefore, can be regenerated back into the cooling tower process. The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation. Because we recycle most of our water back into the process, the discharge water is minimized. This has the effect of lowering wastewater treatment costs. We have assessed our water needs and determined we have an adequate supply.    
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM, Inc. was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant. We were granted a license by Butamax Advanced Biofuels, LLC ("Butamax") to use certain corn oil separation technology in exchange for payment of certain license fees which are subject to being reduced under the terms of the agreements if the corn oil separation system does not meet certain performance goals.
Seasonality Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving and, as a result, increased gasoline demand. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. We also experience decreased distillers grains demand during the summer months due to natural depletion in the size of herds at cattle feed lots and when the animals are turned out to pasture or are slaughtered. Further, we expect some seasonality of demand for our corn oil since a major corn oil user is biodiesel plants which typically reduce production during the winter months. 
Working Capital
We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the ethanol plant. Our primary sources of working capital are cash generated by our operations and our Term Revolving Loan with Compeer Financial f/k/a AgStar Financial Services, PCA ("Compeer"). At October 31, 2018, we had approximately $16,000,000 available to draw on our Term Revolving Loan. 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
As discussed above, we have a marketing agreement with RPMG for the marketing, sale and distribution of our ethanol and corn oil and have engaged CHS for marketing, selling and distributing our distillers dried grains with solubles. We expect to rely on RPMG for the sale and distribution of our ethanol and corn oil and CHS for the sale and distribution of our distillers dried grains with solubles. Therefore, although there are other marketers in the industry, we are highly dependent on RPMG and CHS for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of RPMG or CHS as our marketing agents could have a significant negative impact on our revenues. We market and sell our own distillers modified wet grains.

Federal Ethanol Supports and Governmental Regulation
Federal Ethanol Supports 
The ethanol industry is dependent on economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is required by statute to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations. The statutory volumes and the EPA's volumes for 2014 through 2019 (in billion gallons) are as follows:

 | | Total Renewable Fuel Volume Requirement | Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol
2014 | Statutory | 18.15 | 14.40 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 16.28 | 13.61 
2015 | Statutory | 20.50 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 16.93 | 14.05 
2016 | Statutory | 22.25 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 18.11 | 14.50 
2017 | Statutory | 24.00 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/23/2016 | 19.28 | 15.00 
2018 | Statutory | 26.00 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/17 | 19.29 | 15.00 
2019 | Statutory | 28.00 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/18 | 19.92 | 15.00 

If the volume requirements under the RFS were to be reduced, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which could negatively impact our financial performance. 

In February 2010, the EPA issued additional regulations governing the RFS. These additional regulations have been called RFS2. The most controversial part of RFS2 involves what is commonly referred to as the lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% greenhouse gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. The scientific method of calculating these greenhouse gas reductions has been a contentious issue. Many in the ethanol industry were concerned that corn based ethanol would not meet the 20% greenhouse gas reduction requirement based on certain parts of the environmental impact model that many in the ethanol industry believed was scientifically suspect. However, RFS2 as adopted by the EPA provides that corn-based ethanol from modern ethanol production processes does meet the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions. Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may 
9

disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. 

Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. Estimates indicate that the 2018 gasoline demand in the United States will be approximately 143 billion gallons. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol is 14.3 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the “blending wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends such as E85 used in flex fuel vehicles. These higher percentage blends may lead to additional ethanol demand if they become more widely available and accepted by the market.
 In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although there have been significant steps towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which may prevent E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. Recently, President Trump announced plans to change this policy. However the EPA has not yet taken steps to enable the year-round sale of E15 and it is uncertain when this might occur.
A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50, and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at retail stations. The increased use of blender pumps may increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost-effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the market.
Effect of Governmental Regulation 
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. For example, changes in the environmental regulations regarding the required oxygen content of automobile emissions could have an adverse effect on the ethanol industry. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions effecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance. 
In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. However, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.

Competition
Ethanol
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of whom have greater resources than we do. Following the significant growth during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. As of September 20, 2018, the Renewable Fuels Association estimated that there are approximately 210 ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with capacity to produce approximately 16.4 billion gallons of ethanol and seven additional plants under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 362 million gallons. However, the Renewable Fuels Association estimated that approximately 3% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States was currently idled. 
Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. We have also experienced increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. The ethanol industry is continuing to consolidate where a few larger ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities and are controlling a larger portion of the United States ethanol production. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operation margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. 
The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Flint Hill Resources, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. The following table identifies the majority of the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities.
U.S. FUEL ETHANOL PRODUCTION CAPACITY 
BY TOP PRODUCERS
Producers of Approximately 750
million gallons per year (mmgy) or more

Company | Current Capacity(mmgy)
POET Biorefining | 1,716.0 
Archer Daniels Midland | 1,711.0 
Green Plains Renewable Energy | 1,475.0 
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,400.0 
Flint Hill Resources | 840.0 

Updated: September 20, 2018
We face competition from ethanol produced outside of the United States, particularly from Brazil. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years due to the increase by Brazil in 2013 of its domestic ethanol use requirement from 20% to 25% and the institution in 2017 of a quota and tariff on ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil which have likely decreased the amount of ethanol Brazil has available for export. However, increased competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries, could have a negative impact on demand for ethanol produced in the United States in the future which could result in lower operating margins.
We also anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock is cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice and straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Several companies and researchers have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and a few companies in the United States have produced on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance

than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
Our ethanol plant also competes with producers of other gasoline additives having similar octane and oxygenate values as ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and alternative ethanol production methods are also continually under development. The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to market other additives, to develop alternative products, and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. These companies also have sufficient resources to begin production of ethanol should they choose to do so.
 A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While in the past there were a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations which have made electric car technology more widely available. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.

Many ethanol producers are increasing production capacities through expansion projects. This may lead to an excess supply of ethanol in the market which could negatively impact ethanol prices. 
Distillers Grains 
Our ethanol plant competes with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Distillers grains are primarily used as animal feed which replaces corn and soybean meal. As a result, distillers grains prices are impacted by corn and soybean prices. In addition, increased exports of distillers grains have positively affected demand and distillers grains prices. If distillers grains exports decline, it could result in an oversupply in the market causing distillers grains prices in the United States to decrease. 
Corn Oil Competition
We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales and has resulted in lower market corn oil prices.
Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws
We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we were required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. Additionally, any changes that are made to the ethanol plant or its operations must be reviewed to determine if amended permits need to be obtained in order to implement these changes. 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $268,380 complying with environmental laws. 
Butamax Advanced Biofuels Letter of Intent
In November 2011, we signed a non-binding letter of intent with Butamax Advanced Biofuels, L.L.C. ("Butamax") for the purpose of exploring the possible implementation of biobutanol technology and commercial-scale production of biobutanol at our facility. We completed Phase 1 of the project in April 2014 with the installation of a corn oil separation system at our plant. Please refer to “ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.” However, Phase 2 of the project, the implementation of biobutanol technology, is dependent upon completion and execution of separate definitive agreements related to biobutanol production and negotiations related to Phase 2 of the project are currently on hold.  We may never enter into those definitive agreements with Butamax and, therefore, may never convert our ethanol facility to a biobutanol facility.

Employees 
As of October 31, 2018, we had 42 full-time employees. We do not expect the number of employees to materially change in the next twelve months.
