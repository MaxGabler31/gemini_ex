Recent Developments
 
Effective at the opening on August 23, 2018, shares of our common stock were approved for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the symbol “FTM”. We were approved for listing as a Tier 2 Oil and Gas Reserves Issuer.
 
On August 23, 2018, we appointed Konstantine Vatskalis, Sandra Perry, William Via and Brett Matich as directors of the Company and Robert DaCunha resigned as a director of the Company. The Company’s board of directors was comprised of Marc Bruner, Michael Caetano, Konstantine Vatskalis, Sandra Perry, William Via and Brett Matich.
 
On September 26, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with a major Canadian oil and gas company to purchase a 100% working interest in three heavy oil leases (the “Oil Leases”) covering a total of 20,719 hectares (51,200 acres) of heavy oil in north central Alberta (the “Transaction”). The rights to the Oil Leases, cover heavy oil of 12-16 API located near the top of the Viking formation to the base of the Woodbend Group.
 
The acquisition of the Oil Leases complements the Company’s existing land holdings of 12,800 acres directly adjacent to and to the south of the Oil Leases. Upon completion of the Transaction, we will own over 62,000 acres of which 48,000 is contiguous land containing extensive heavy oil deposits within the main producing horizon, the Wabiskaw formation, along with a secondary horizon, namely the McMurray formation.

As consideration for the Oil Leases, we agreed to pay a purchase price of CDN$3,000,000 plus applicable GST, CDN$200,000 of which was paid as an initial deposit upon the execution of the Agreement. The closing of the Transaction was expected to occur on November 15, 2018 with an option to extend the closing date 60 days upon payment of an additional deposit of CDN$100,000. In November 2018, the Company exercised the option and extended the closing of the Transaction to January 14, 2019 with a payment of CDN$100,000. In December 2018, March, June, and September 2019, the Company and the vendor entered into extension agreements whereby the closing date of the Transaction was extended to a date on or before November 19, 2019 and the deposit increased by an additional CDN$200,000 which was paid. We anticipate that the transaction will constitute an Exempt Transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange. The Agreement was entered into on September 26, 2018 but is effective as of August 1, 2018.
 
In addition to the Oil Leases, upon closing of the Transaction, we will also obtain all rights, titles and interests to certain wells and facilities (as set out in the Agreement) located on the Oil Leases. The expiry dates for the three Oil Leases are as follows:
 

● | September 29, 2028; 
--+--------------------------
● | January 26, 2029; and 
● | March 9, 2029 

 
On July 2, 2019, Sandra Perry resigned as a director of our Company.
 
On September 23, 2019, the Company entered into a non-binding term sheet with an arm’s length party (the “Farmee”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to farm-out a portion of the Rolling Rock Property, and to establish a joint venture, subject to the entry of a definitive transaction agreement. Pursuant to the term sheet, the Farmee will commit up to $15,000,000 (the “Commitment Amount”) in up to ten tranches (each, a “Tranche”) in exchange for a 100% operating interest in certain wells located on the Rolling Rock Property (the “Operating Interest”). Upon full payout of the Commitment Amount, the Company will be entitled to a 20% interest in the income generated from the Farmee’s activities, which interest shall be increased to 25% following a 2.0x return of capital of the Farmee’s investment (the “Carry Structure”). The Operating Interest will be conveyed to the Farmee upon the execution of the Definitive Agreement for the Obligation Tranche and upon affirmative election by the Farmee to proceed with any Subsequent Tranche.
 
A subsidiary of the Farmee, in collaboration with the Company and Rolling Rock, is anticipated to be the operator upon formation of the joint venture in regards to the participating wells. All costs related to the wellbores subsequent to re-entry, including plugging and abandonment costs, will be borne in proportion to the carry structure at the time of commencement of wellbore operations. No additional midstream fees are to be charged by the Company, Rolling Rock, any related party or affiliate thereof to the Farmee that are in excess of, or including a margin on top of the necessary operating expenses incurred to gather, compress, process, dehydrate, treat, and/or transport gas to sale. The joint venture and all gas produced as a direct result of the Farmee, the Company and Rolling Rock’s activities will have primary service that takes precedent over any third party gas produce from the subject wells.
 
The Oil Leases
 
We have commenced the consultation process with the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) and other Alberta government agencies, along with Bigstone Cree Nation, a First Nations band party to Treaty Eight and other interested stakeholders. Accordingly, participation in the consultation process is a pre-requisite to commencing operations on the Oil Leases. Assuming closing of the Transaction, we hope to commence initial drilling and work in the second quarter of 2019, once the consultation process has been completed.
Compeer Oil and Gas Operations
 
As of February 28, 2019, we have incurred $720,060 in exploration costs to drill, complete and equip the Test Well. We also recorded $29,272 in asset retirement obligations related to the future plugging and abandonment of the Test Well.
 
As at October 15, 2019, it is too early to provide stabilized production forecasts.
 
Future Development Costs for Compeer
 
During fiscal 2019/2020, we plan to focus on the exploration and drilling of the Farmout Lands, identify and complete additional asset acquisition(s), and pursue joint venture agreements with third parties to explore for oil and gas in Canada and the United States.

Colony Energy
 
On April 7, 2017, we entered into and closed two Membership Interest Purchase Agreements with three vendors to acquire all the membership interests of Colony Energy, LLC (“Colony Energy”), a Nevada limited liability company.

This change modified the original requirement to pay $900,000 on or before September 1, 2017, $900,000 on or before March 1, 2018 and $800,000 on or before September 1, 2018.

● | postponing payment of the remaining US$3.8 million owed under the Black Dragon PSA relating to the Moenkopi Formation until receipt of the proceeds of one or more financings by the Company, in which case the Company must pay 12.5% of the proceeds of each financing close until payment in full; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each vertical well drilled to 200 feet below the top of the Kaibab formation through completion (or plugging or abandonment) within a Federal Unit, the obligation deadline will be amended to the later of (i) the current obligation deadline or (ii) 6 months from the date the rig that drilled such vertical well to total depth has been removed from the wellsite.
 
Within 10 business days after the later of Black Dragon paying the cash consideration in full or Black Dragon meeting in full its carry obligation, the vendor will convey to Black Dragon an undivided 75% of the Vendor’s right, title and interest in and to the assets, at an 80% Net Revenue Interest in the assets as further described in the Black Dragon PSA.

Each share purchase warrant is exercisable for a term equal to the greater of two years from the closing of the Final Funding Tranche or 18 months from the issuance of the License at an exercise price of $0.51 for the first year and $1.02 for the second year. Asia Pacific utilized $500,000 of the initial three tranches towards an exploration program of the City of Gold Project. Asia Pacific is required to use all proceeds for the Final Funding Tranche towards exploration of the Project Subsidiary’s mining interests, including no less than $500,000 towards drilling the City of Gold Project (the “Drilling Program”). Upon the closing of the Final Funding Tranche, City of Gold, LLC will have earned the Option. We anticipate that the normal course of receiving the License will take longer than 12 months. As a result, we do not anticipate commencing the Drilling Program or incurring additional expenses related to the project within the next 12 month period. We anticipate holding our interest in the City of Gold Project for the long term. If circumstances warrant, we intend to exercise the Option by transferring the City of Gold Project into a subsidiary (“Spinco”) with the aim of completing a “spin-off” transaction of its anticipated 70% interest in Spinco under the plan of arrangement provisions in accordance with applicable securities and corporate laws in order to realize a benefit for our company and/or our stockholders.
 
Once City of Gold, LLC has earned the Option, it will have the right to exercise the Option for a period of 120 days from completion of the Drilling Program, which City of Gold, LLC can extend for an additional 120 days if it can demonstrate that all conditions to exercise of the Option are complete other than approval from the applicable stock exchange upon which the shares of Spinco are to be listed. To exercise the Option, Asia Pacific has agreed to transfer the Project Subsidiary to Spinco for an exercise price consisting of $7,000,000 in cash and 30% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Spinco (calculated on a fully diluted basis, excluding up to 10% in stock options, but including shares Spinco may have issued in order to raise the exercise price of $7,000,000 and an additional $5,000,000 in working capital). Half of the cash portion of the exercise price must be paid upon exercise of the Option; the balance is to be paid on the first anniversary of the exercise and is to be evidenced by a one-year secured term note. Although City of Gold, LLC has the right to select Spinco, Spinco must meet the following criteria: at exercise of the Option, Spinco must have less than $100,000 in liabilities and $5,000,000 or more in working capital and Asia Pacific will have the right to nominate 30% of its directors. Although we currently anticipate that the exercise of the Option will be structured as a “spin-off” transaction, we have the flexibility under the Option Agreement to structure the transaction in other ways provided the conditions to exercise are met. However, we anticipate that such a structure will result in the most efficient way to monetize our interest in the City of Gold Project at this time.
 
Competition
 
The petroleum and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Numerous independent oil and gas companies, oil and gas syndicates and major oil and gas companies actively seek out and bid for oil and gas properties as well as for the services of third party providers, such as drilling companies, upon which we rely. A substantial number of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do, and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles.
 
Some of our competitors not only explore for, produce and market petroleum and natural gas, but also carry out refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis which may provide them with additional sources of capital. Larger and better capitalized competitors may be in a position to outbid us for particular prospect rights. These competitors may also be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling. Larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
 
Petroleum and natural gas producers also compete with other suppliers of energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual customers. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and/or their agencies and other factors which are out of our control including, international political conditions, terrorism, overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas, and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources.
 
To better deal with the competition, we target high potential exploration properties which are too small for our largest competitors. We rely upon the technical experience of our officers and engineers to select those properties on which our exploration expertise provides a differentiating advantage.
 
Customers
 
There are no contracts obligating our company to provide a fixed quantity of oil and gas to any party.

Regulation
 
The exploration, production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental authorities. Applicable legislation is under constant review for amendment or expansion. These efforts frequently result in an increase in the regulatory burden on companies in our industry and consequently an increase in the cost of doing business and decrease in profitability. Numerous governmental departments and agencies are authorized to, and have, issued rules and regulations imposing additional burdens on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for non-compliance. Production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities.
 
Oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals, corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located. As a general rule, parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights. The terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development. Notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights, the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells.
 
Each province and the federal government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes, environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada and Alberta have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays, tax credits and drilling royalty credits. These incentives are for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally increase cash flow.
 
Effective January 1, 2009, oil sands royalties in Alberta are calculated using a sliding scale for royalty rates ranging from 1% to 9% pre-payout and 25% to 40% post-payout depending on the world oil price. Project “payout” refers to the point in which we earn sufficient revenues to recover all of the allowed costs for the project plus a return allowance. The base royalty starts at 1% and increases for every dollar the world oil price, as reflected by the WTI, is priced above $55 per barrel, to a maximum of 9% when oil is priced at $120 per barrel or greater. The net royalty starts at 25% and increases for every dollar oil is priced above $55 per barrel to 40% when oil is priced at $120 or higher.
 
The exploration and development of oil and gas properties is subject to various United States federal, state and local governmental regulations. Our company may, from time to time, be required to obtain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities in regards to the exploration of our property interests. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas.
 
Environmental Considerations
 
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental laws and regulations pursuant to United States and Canadian local, state, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury, clean-up costs and other environmental and property damages as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Accordingly, we could be liable or could be required to cease production on properties if environmental damage occurs. Although we maintain insurance coverage, the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business. Furthermore, future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur that result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We maintain commercial property and general liability insurance coverage on the properties we operate. We also maintain operators extra expense insurance which provides coverage for well control incidents specifically relating to regaining control of a well, seepage, pollution, clean-up and containment. No coverage is maintained with respect to any fine or penalty required to be paid due to a violation of the regulations set out by the federal and provincial regulatory authorities. We are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment.

Alberta’s new climate change regulation, effective July 1, 2007, requires Alberta facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year to reduce emissions intensity by 12 per cent. Companies have four choices to meet their reductions: (1) they can make operating improvements to their operations that will result in greenhouse gas emission reductions; (2) purchase Alberta based offset credits; (3) contribute to the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund; and (4) purchase or use emission performance credits, also called EPCs, these credits are generated by facilities that have gone beyond the 12% mandatory intensity reduction. EPCs can be banked for future use or sold to other facilities that need to meet the reduction target.
 
On June 18, 2009, the Canadian government passed the new Environmental Enforcement Act (“EEA”). The EEA was created to strengthen and amend nine existing Statutes that relate to the environment and to enact provisions respecting the enforcement of certain Statutes that relate to the environment. The EEA amends various enforcement, offence, penalty and sentencing provisions to deter offenders from committing offences under the EEA by setting minimum and maximum fines for serious offences. The EEA also gives enforcement officers new powers to investigate cases and grants courts new sentencing authorities that ensure penalties reflect the seriousness of the pollution and wildlife offences. The EEA also expands the authority to deal with environmental offenders by: (1) specifying aggravating factors such as causing damage to wildlife or wildlife habitat, or causing damage that is extensive, persistent or irreparable; (2) providing fine ranges that are higher for corporate offenders than for individuals; (3) doubling fine ranges for repeat offenders; (4) authorizing the suspension and cancellation of licenses, permits or other authorizations upon conviction; (5) requiring corporate offenders to report convictions to shareholders; and (6) mandating the reporting of corporate offences on a public registry.
 
The production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment. Additionally, we may incur expenditures related to compliance with such laws, and may incur costs in connection with the remediation of any environmental contamination. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.
