Item 1. Business
W&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico. W&T Offshore, Inc. is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988, and successor by merger to W&T Oil Properties, Inc., a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983.
Since our founding in 1983 by our Chairman and CEO, Tracy Krohn, we have continually grown our footprint in the Gulf of Mexico through acquisitions, exploration and development. We currently hold working interests in 43 offshore producing fields in federal and state waters. Our acreage, well, production and reserves information is described in more detail under Part I Item 2, Properties, in this Form 10-K. Our working interests in fields, leases, structures and equipment are primarily owned by W&T Offshore, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Aquasition LLC (“A-I LLC”), Aquasition II LLC (“A-II LLC”), and W&T Energy VI, LLC, Delaware limited liability companies and through our proportionately consolidated interest in Monza Energy, LLC (“Monza”), as described in more detail in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 – Joint Venture Drilling Program under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.
We have developed significant technical expertise in finding and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico with production rates which provide the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital. We have leveraged our experience in the conventional shelf to develop higher impact capital projects in the Gulf of Mexico in both the deepwater and the deep shelf. We have acquired rights to explore and develop new prospects and existing oil and natural gas properties in both the deepwater and the deep shelf, while at the same time continuing our focus on the conventional shelf. Our drilling efforts in recent years have included the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to pursue risk-adjusted, high rate of return projects and develop oil and natural gas resources that allow us to grow our production, reserves and cash flow in a capital efficient manner, thus enhancing the value of our assets. We intend to execute the following elements of our business strategy in order to achieve this goal:

● | Exploiting existing and acquired properties to add additional reserves and production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring for reserves on our extensive acreage holdings and in other areas of the Gulf of Mexico;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquiring reserves with substantial upside potential and additional leasehold acreage complementary to our existing acreage position at attractive prices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to manage our balance sheet in a prudent manner and continuing our track record of financial flexibility in any commodity price environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our focus is on making profitable investments while operating within cash flow, maintaining sufficient liquidity, achieving prudent cost reductions and fulfilling our contractual, legal and financial obligations. Over time, we expect to de-lever through free cash flow generated by our producing asset base, organic growth opportunities and acquisitions. We continually monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess if changes are needed to our plans.
Market Trends
In managing our business, we are focused on optimizing production and increasing reserves in a profitable and prudent manner, while managing cash flows to meet our obligations and investment needs. Our cash flows are materially impacted by the prices of commodities we produce (crude oil, natural gas and the natural gas liquids (“NGLs”)). In addition, the prices of goods and services used in our business can vary and impact our cash flows.

During 2021, commodity prices experienced significant improvement, particularly crude oil prices, due to a confluence of factors that have provided positive developments to the overall pricing environment when compared to 2020. With some exceptions, pandemic-related travel restrictions have gradually eased as governments continue to have increasing access to vaccines that help reduce the spread of COVID-19. As restrictions continue to abate, there is renewed emphasis on improving economic activity to pre-pandemic levels while managing the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19. Meanwhile, commodity prices demonstrated resiliency during the year. Producers continued to show restraint in increasing their capital expenditures even as prices increased, thereby causing a muted response in supply as demand for commodities increased. Additionally, OPEC Plus remained committed to modest increases in production during the year as the global economy recovered.‌
​
While the current outlook for commodity prices is favorable and our operations are no longer significantly impacted by confinement restrictions, the risk of disruption to our operations continues as the emergence of a new variant of COVID-19 could adversely impact our operations, or commodity prices could significantly decline from current levels. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve and, during the fourth quarter of 2021, a new variant emerged, the Omicron variant. It is difficult to assess if it will cause meaningful disruptions in economic activity across the world and if there will be any significant impacts in demand for energy. 
​
The recent invasion of parts of Ukraine by Russia, and the impact of world sanctions against Russia and the potential for retaliatory acts from Russia, are world events that can result in potential commodities and securities market disruptions that could affect world oil and natural gas markets and the volatility of oil and gas commodity prices and thus impact the Company’s business, stock trading price and availability of capital. Additionally, while OPEC Plus remained committed to steady and predictable production increases throughout 2021, it is difficult to determine whether it will change its production output policy or whether its members will remain committed to the production quotas set by the organization as a result of these events. 
​
Our margins in 2021 decreased from 2020 primarily due to realized derivative gains in 2020 compared to realized derivative losses in 2021, partially offset by higher average realized commodity prices in 2021 compared to 2020. We measure margins using net (loss) income before net interest expense; income tax (benefit) expense; depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion; unrealized commodity derivative gain or loss; amortization of derivative premiums; bad debt reserve; gain on debt transaction; release of restricted funds; litigation; and other (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as a percent of revenue, which is a not a financial measurement under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Our total production decreased 9.6% in 2021 from the prior year. Our proved reserves increased by 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) in 2021, primarily due to the significant increase in commodity prices in 2021 as compared to 2020. 
We continually monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess what changes, if any, should be made to our 2022 plans. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We also face increasing indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar, and electric power. We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and lease sales primarily on the basis of price for such properties. We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. Many of these competitors are large, well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties. Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties, acquire additional leases and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties, finance investments and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.

Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments
We sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party customers. We are not dependent upon, or contractually limited to, any one customer or small group of customers. However, in 2021, approximately 34% of our revenues were received from BP Products North America, 14% from Chevron-Texaco and 11% from Williams Field Services, with no other customer comprising greater than 10% of our 2021 revenues. Given the commoditized nature of the products we produce and market and the location of our production in the Gulf of Mexico, we believe the loss of any of the customers above would not result in a material adverse effect on our ability to market future oil and natural gas, as replacement customers could be obtained in a relatively short period of time on terms, conditions, and pricing substantially similar to those currently existing. We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver a fixed volume of physical products to customers.
Compliance with Government Regulations
Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), both agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”), have adopted regulations pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) that apply to our operations on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”). In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993. Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices. The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and NGLs, under various statutes.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. We are required to observe the market related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake. Any violation of the FTC, FERC, and CFTC prohibitions on market manipulation can result in substantial civil penalties amounting to over $1.0 million per violation per day.
These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations, and to levy substantial penalties for non-compliance. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Federal leases. Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases in the OCS waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The DOI has delegated its authority to issue federal leases granted under the OCSLA to the BOEM, which has adopted and implemented regulations relating to the issuance and operation of oil and natural gas leases on the OCS. These leases are awarded by the BOEM based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms. These leases require compliance with the BOEM, the BSEE, and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change. The BSEE also regulates the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and, following cessation of operations, the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities, structures and pipelines on the OCS (collectively, these activities are referred to as “decommissioning”), while the BOEM governs financial assurance requirements associated with those decommissioning obligations.

President Biden has made tackling climate change, including the restriction or elimination of future greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), a priority in his administration. The Biden Administration has already adopted several executive orders and is expected to pursue additional orders and pursue legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives in support of this regulatory agenda. Notably, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 suspending new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on federal lands and offshore waters pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. The suspension of these federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district court in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. Subsequent federal litigation, however has impeded the most recent federal oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico requiring the DOI to conduct a new environmental analysis that takes into consideration such climate effects before holding another sale. In November 2021, the DOI released its report on federal oil and gas leasing and permitting practices. The report includes recommendations in respect to offshore sector, including adjusting royalty rates to ensure that the full value of the tracts being leased are captured, strengthening financial assurance coverage amounts that are required by operators, establishing a “fitness to operate” criteria that companies would need to meet in respect of safety, environmental and financial responsibilities in order to operate on the OCS. Several of the report recommendations require action by the Congress and cannot be implemented unilaterally by the Biden Administration. We continue to conduct our operations on our existing leases in the OCS; however, uncertainty on future Biden Administration actions with regard to offshore oil and gas activities on the OCS together with the issuance of any future executive orders or adoption and implementation of laws, rules or initiatives that further restrict, delay or result in cancellation of existing oil and gas activities on the OCS could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements. The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS. In 2016, the BOEM under the Obama Administration issued Notice to Lessees and Operators 2016-N01 (the “2016 NTL”) to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, rights of way (“ROWs”) and rights of use and easement (“RUEs”). The 2016 NTL was not fully implemented as the BOEM under the Trump Administration rescinded the 2016 NTL in 2020. In October 2020, BOEM published jointly with BSEE a proposed rule that sought to clarify and provide greater transparency to decommissioning and related financial assurance requirements imposed on record title owners and operating rights owners of interests in federal OCS leases and RUE and ROW grant holders conducting operations on the federal OCS. 
Consistent with the November 2021 DOI leasing report recommendations and in response to President Biden’s January 2021 executive order, the Biden Administration could pursue more stringent decommissioning and financial assurance requirements that could increase our operating costs. In the federal government’s most recent list of potential regulatory actions for 2022, the BSEE lists its plans to propose rules finalizing the policies and procedures concerning compliance with OCS oil and gas decommissioning obligations originally proposed under the Trump Administration. In addition, BOEM lists its plans to propose a new rule in respect of financial assurance. The BOEM has the authority to issue liability orders in the future, including if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning liabilities. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.
Reporting of decommissioning expenditures. Under applicable BSEE regulations, lessees operating on the OCS and conducting decommissioning activities are required to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of subject wells, platforms, and other facilities. The BSEE has reported that it uses this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning costs, and the BOEM typically relies upon the BSEE’s estimates to set the amount of required bonds or other forms of financial security in order to minimize the government’s perceived risk of potential decommissioning liability.

Regulation and transportation of natural gas. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry. As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers. The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies. In many instances, the effect of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services. The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority, and FERC exercises its authority either by applying cost-of-service principles or granting market based rates. Similarly, the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time.
The OCSLA, which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service. One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out OCSLA’s mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market, to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS, and to provide non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines. The BOEM issued a final rule, effective August 2008, which implements a hotline, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS.
In 2007, the FERC issued rules (“Order 704”) requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state legislatures, state commissions and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. As a result, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and the states will continue. 
While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly, they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets. We cannot predict what further action the FERC, the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters. However, we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently, in any material way, than other natural gas producers with which we compete.
Oil and NGLs transportation rates. Other than as described above, our sales of liquids, which include crude oil, condensate and NGLs, are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction. The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC. In general, interstate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase.

5



In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations. As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines. State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally. We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers.
Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production. Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells.
Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS. The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs. Damage can occur both above the water line and to subsea infrastructure. The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms. In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
General. We are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws. These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment and the discharge and disposal of waste materials and, to the extent waste materials are transported and disposed of in onshore facilities, remediation of any releases of those waste materials from such facilities. Numerous governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often costly to comply with, and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, or development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. Certain environmental laws, such as the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”) impose strict joint and several liability for environmental contamination, such as may arise in the event of an accidental spill on the OCS, rendering a person liable for environmental damage and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. The cost of remediation, reclamation and decommissioning, including abandonment of wells, platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant. These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations. Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, (“CERCLA”) imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to strict joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies.

The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites. RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste”, and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is regulated under less onerous non-hazardous waste requirements, usually under state law.
Standards have been developed under RCRA and/or state laws for worker protection from exposure to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”), treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste, and management of NORM-contaminated piping valves, containers and tanks. Historically, we have not incurred any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with the existing RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste.
Air Emissions and Climate Change. Air emissions from our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state and local requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Since that time, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and, in December 2020, published notice of a final action to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed litigation over this December 2020 final action, and the Biden Administration has announced plans to reconsider the December 2020 final action in favor of a more stringent ground-level ozone NAAQS.
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHG as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. Under the Biden Administration, however, the EPA has adopted regulations under the existing CAA that, among other things, impose preconstruction and operating permit requirements on certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector. Compliance with these rules or other similar rules implemented in the future could result in increased compliance costs on our operations. In November 2021, the EPA also issued a proposed rule that would more stringently regulate methane emissions from crude oil and natural gas sources. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022 with the goal of issuing a final rule by the end of 2022. Additionally, state implementation of revised air emission standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delaying, limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
At the international level, there exists numerous conventions and non-binding commitments of participating nations with goals of limiting their GHG emissions and fossil fuel subsidies. These include the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” to which President Biden recommitted the Unites States, thereby requiring the United States to determine its emissions reduction goals every five years after 2020. The international community also gathered in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”), at which the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 counties joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States’ commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.

Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing federal political risk regarding climate change. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. We are not currently a defendant in any of these lawsuits but could be named in actions making similar allegations. 
Additionally, our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies such as ours but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices that favor “clean” power sources, such as wind and solar, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and are taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders and investors restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies.
The OCSLA authorized the DOI to regulate activities authorized by the BOEM in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The EPA has air quality jurisdiction over all other parts of the OCS. Under the OCSLA, DOI is limited to regulating offshore emissions of criteria and their precursor – pollutants to the extent they significantly affect the air quality of any state. BSEE conducts field inspections of emission sources installed on offshore platforms that have the potential to emit regulated air pollutants. The agency also reviews BOEM-mandated monitoring and reporting of air emission sources for compliance with approved plan emission limits. BSEE may initiate measures to control and bring into compliance those operations determined to be in violation of applicable regulations or plan conditions by issuing Incidents of Noncompliance (“INC”) or recommending further enforcement action against potential violators.
Water Discharges. The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the OPA which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”). OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters, including the OCS or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several, strict liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to oil and natural resource release related damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In January 2018, the BOEM raised OPA’s damages liability cap to $137.7 million; however, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party failed to report a spill or cooperate fully in the cleanup. OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans. These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill. In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35.0 million and $150.0 million for companies operating on the OCS. We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $35.0 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS.

The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant have compliance costs. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. Our Board of Directors reviews our Clean Water Act compliance metrics on a quarterly basis.
Marine Protected Areas and Endangered and Threatened Species. Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs. The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable. It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment. In addition, Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of lives of protected marine species (sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species).
Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as “threatened” or “endangered” are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”). This law prohibits any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) under former President Trump issued a final rule in January 2021, which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”) will apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs; however, in October 2021, the USFWS under the Biden Administration revoked the Trump Administration’s rule on incidental take and published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to codify a general prohibition on incidental take while establishing a process to regulate or permit exceptions to such a prohibition. Additionally, the USFWS may make determinations on the listing of species as threatened or endangered under the ESA and litigation with respect to the listing or non-listing of certain species may result in more fulsome protections for non-protected or lesser-protected species. We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist.
Other federal statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. These laws and related implementing regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands. These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife, and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.
The leases and permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Moreover, applicable leasing and permitting programs may be subject to legislative, regulatory or executive actions to delay or suspend the issuance of leases and permits.

Seasonality and Inflation
Seasonality. Generally, the demand for and price of natural gas increases during the winter months and decreases during the summer months. However, these seasonal fluctuations are somewhat reduced because during the summer, pipeline companies, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users purchase and place into storage facilities a portion of their anticipated winter requirements of natural gas. As utilities continue to switch from coal to natural gas, some of this seasonality has been reduced as natural gas is used for both heating and cooling. In addition, the demand for oil is higher in the winter months, but does not fluctuate seasonally as much as natural gas. Seasonal weather changes affect our operations. Tropical storms and hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall, which can require us to evacuate personnel and shut in production until a storm subsides. Also, periodic storms during the winter often impede our ability to safely load, unload and transport personnel and equipment, which delays the installation of production facilities, thereby delaying production and sales of our oil and natural gas.
Inflation. Although inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years, it rose significantly in the second half of 2021. This is believed to be the result of the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the global supply chain disruptions, among other factors. For 2021, our realized prices for crude oil increased 71.5%, NGLs increased 171.6% and natural gas increased 89.0% from 2020. Historically, our operating costs have moved directionally with the price of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as these commodities affect the demand for these goods and services, but the timing of such increases and decreases may lag behind changes in commodity prices. However, global, industry-wide supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have also resulted in shortages in labor, materials and services which have resulted in inflationary cost increases for labor, materials and services and could continue to cause costs to increase as well as scarcity of certain products and raw materials. We are experiencing some inflationary pressure for certain costs, including employees and vendors, although such cost increases did not materially impact our 2021 financial condition or results of operations, and we currently do not expect them to materially impact our 2022 financial results or operations. However, to the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience further cost increases for our operations, including natural gas purchases and oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations, as well as increased labor costs. An increase in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may cause the costs of materials and services to rise. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation and a significant increase in inflation, to the extent we are unable to recover higher costs through higher commodity prices and revenues, would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Human Capital Resources
People are our most valuable asset, and we strive to provide a work environment that attracts and retains the top talent in the industry, reflects our core values and demonstrates our core values to the communities in which we operate.
As of December 31, 2021, our personnel base consisted of 323 of our employees and over 330 individuals who are employees of third parties that provide skilled labor in support of our field operations. This combined workforce conducts our business in Texas, Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico. Our workforce in Texas is primarily composed of our corporate employees, including our executive officers, drilling and production managers, technical engineers and administrative and support staff. Our employees in Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily composed of skilled labor who conduct our field operations and manage third party personnel used in support of our field operations. We focus on certain measures and objectives when managing our workforce that are material in understanding our business, which are summarized below:
Health and Safety. Our highest priorities are the safety of all personnel and protection of the environment. To drive a culture of personnel safety in our operations, we operate under a comprehensive Safety and Environmental Management System (“SEMS”). Our 2021 total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) for employees was 0.32, which is far below the industry average for the Gulf of Mexico of 1.01. Our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HS&E”) group is comprised of a Vice President, and Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Managers and 9 staff personnel. The Department works with field personnel to create and regularly review safety policies and procedures, in an effort to support continuous improvement of our SEMS .Our Board of Directors reviews our material safety metrics on a quarterly basis.

As a company identified by the Federal Government as essential to the critical infrastructure of the United States, we have continuously operated during the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide our personnel with a physically safer work environment and mitigate the risks associated with the transmission of COVID-19, we implement policies requiring mandatory face masks and social distancing in all work environments, conduct daily temperature screening at all locations and COVID-19 testing for field project crews.
Recruitment and Compensation. We pride ourselves on providing an attractive compensation and benefits program that allows our employees to view working at W&T as more than where they work, but a place where they may grow and develop. Our ability to succeed depends on recruiting and retaining top talent in the industry. We believe employees choose W&T in part due to our professional advancement opportunities, on the job training, engaging culture and competitive compensation and benefits.
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness. We believe these solutions help the overall health and wellness of our employees and help us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population. Global, industry-wide supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in shortages in labor, which have resulted in inflationary cost increases for labor and could continue to cause costs to increase. If these conditions continue, it could result in increased wages to retain existing employees and impact what we offer prospective employees in the future in order to remain competitive.
Diversity and Inclusion. The key to our past and future successes is promoting a workforce culture that embraces integrity, honesty and transparency to those with whom we interact, and fosters a trusting and respectful work environment that embraces changes and moves us forward in an innovative and positive way.
Our policies and practices support diversity of thought, perspective, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture and professional experience. From recent graduates to experienced hires, we seek to attract and develop top talent to continue building a unique blend of cultures, backgrounds, skills and beliefs that mirrors the world we live in. The tables below present, by category of employee, the gender and ethnicity composition of our employees as of December 31, 2021:
