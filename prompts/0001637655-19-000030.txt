Item 1.    Business
Overview
Horizon Global Corporation, which we refer to herein as “Horizon,” “Horizon Global,” “we” or the “Company,” became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a tax-free spin-off (the “Spin-off”) from TriMas Corporation, or “TriMas,” on June 30, 2015. To affect the Spin-off, each TriMas shareholder of record as of the close of business on June 25, 2015 (the “Record Date”) received two Horizon Global common shares for every five TriMas common shares held as of the Record Date. On July 1, 2015, the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “HZN”. 
We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of high-quality, custom-engineered towing, trailering, cargo management and other related accessory products on a global basis, serving the automotive aftermarket, retail and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and servicers (“OESs”) (collectively “OEs”) channels. 
The Company is organized into three operating segments: Horizon Americas, Horizon Asia-Pacific, and Horizon Europe-Africa. Horizon Americas has operations in North and South America and is generally a leader in towing and trailering-related products sold through retail, aftermarket, OE, e-commerce and industrial channels, especially in North America. Horizon Asia‑Pacific and Horizon Europe‑Africa focus their sales and manufacturing efforts outside of North and South America. Horizon Asia‑Pacific operates primarily in Australia, Thailand, and New Zealand, while Horizon Europe‑Africa operates primarily in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Romania, and South Africa. We believe Horizon Asia‑Pacific and Horizon Europe‑Africa have been leaders in towing related products sold through the OE and aftermarket channels in their regions. 
Our products are used in two primary categories across the world: commercial applications, or “Work,” and recreational activities, or “Play.” Some of the markets in our Work category include agricultural, automotive, construction, fleet, industrial, marine, military, mining and municipalities. Some of the markets in our Play category include equestrian, power sports, recreational vehicle, specialty automotive, truck accessory and other specialty towing applications. We believe that the primary brands we offer are among the most recognized in the markets we serve and are known for quality, safety and performance. Our products reach end consumers through many avenues, including independent installers, warehouse distributors, dealers, OE, retail stores and online retailers.
We believe no individual competitor serving the channels we participate in can match our broad product portfolio, which we categorize into the following four groups:

▪ | Towing: This product category includes devices and accessories installed on a tow-vehicle for the purpose of attaching a trailer, camper, etc. such as hitches, fifth wheels, gooseneck hitches, weight distribution systems, wiring harnesses, draw bars, ball mounts, crossbars, tow bars, security and other towing accessories; 


▪ | Trailering: This product category includes control devices and components of the trailer itself such as brake controls, jacks, winches, couplers, interior and exterior vehicle lighting and brake replacement parts; 


▪ | Cargo Management: This product category includes a wide variety of products used to facilitate the transportation of various forms of cargo, to secure that cargo or to organize items. Examples of these products are bike racks, roof cross bar systems, cargo carriers, luggage boxes, car interior protective products, rope, tie-downs, tarps, tarp straps, bungee cords, loading ramps and interior travel organizers; and 


▪ | Other: This product category includes a diverse range of items in our portfolio that do not fit into any of the previous three main categories. Items in this category include tubular push bars, side steps, sports bars, skid plates, and oil pans. 

We have positioned our product portfolio to create a variety of options based on price-point, ranging from entry-level to premium-level products across most of our markets. We believe the brands we offer in our aftermarket channel have significant customer recognition, with the four most significant being Reese®, Hayman-Reese™, Draw-Tite® and Westfalia®. We believe all four have substantial market share and have been leading brands in the towing market for over 50 years. These brands provide the foundation of our market position based on worldwide commercial and consumer acceptance. We also maintain a collection of regionally recognized brands that include Aqua Clear™, Bulldog®, BTM, DHF, Engetran, Fulton®, Kovil, Parkside®, Reese Secure™, Reese Explorer™, Reese Power Sports, Reese Towpower™, ROLA®, Tekonsha®, Trojan®, WesBarg®, Witter Towbar

Systems and Best Bars®. In addition to these product brands, we historically marketed our products to our OE customers in the Asia-Pacific segment, and more recently in the Americas, under the name TriMotive.
Our Industry
Our products are sold into a diverse set of end-markets; the primary applications relate to automotive accessories for light and recreational vehicles. Purchases of automotive accessory parts are discretionary, and we believe demand is driven by macro-economic factors including (i) employment trends, (ii) consumer sentiment and (iii) fuel prices, among others.
We believe all of these metrics impact both our Work- and Play-related sales. In addition, we believe the Play-related sales are more sensitive to changes in these indices, given the Play-related sales tend to be more directly related to disposable income levels. In general, recent decreases in unemployment and fuel prices, coupled with increases in consumer sentiment, are positive trends for our businesses.
Aftermarket and Retail Channels
We sell our products in the aftermarket and retail channels to a wide range of customers, including national and regional distributors, installers, and both traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants, including automotive, home hardware, farm and fleet, and mass merchants. More recent trends in the aftermarket and retail channels include:

▪ | Channel Consolidation: In the more mature market of the United States, there has been increasing consolidation in distribution networks with larger, more sophisticated aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. In kind, these distributors generally require larger, more sophisticated suppliers with product expertise, category management and supply chain services and capabilities, as well as a global manufacturing and services footprint. We provide customers in this category the opportunity to rationalize their supply base of vendors in our product lines by virtue of our broad offering and product expertise; and


▪ | Growth of Online Capabilities: Reaching consumers directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is having an increasing impact on the global automotive aftermarket and retail channels. Establishment of a robust online presence is critical for suppliers regardless of whether or not they participate directly in e-commerce. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of this continuing trend, given our established online presence. We support consumers by offering a wide range of information on our products and services, including installation videos, custom-fit guides and links to authorized dealers and both brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants. 

OE Channels
The OE channel is comprised of automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks, referred to collectively as automotive OE, as well as non-automotive manufacturers of agricultural equipment, trailers, and other custom assemblies, collectively referred to as industrial OE. The two main components of this channel are OEMs and OESs. While OE demand is typically driven by planned production, suppliers also grow by increasing their product content on each unit produced through sales of existing product lines or expansion into new product line offerings. Given the consolidation and globalization throughout the automotive industry, suppliers combining a global presence with strong engineering, technology, manufacturing, supply chain and customer support will be best positioned to take advantage of automotive OE business opportunities. 
More recent trends in the global OE supplier market include:

▪ | Global Platform/Supplier Consolidation: Automotive OEs are adopting global vehicle platforms to decrease product development costs and increase manufacturing efficiency and profitability. As a result, automotive OEs are selecting

suppliers that have the capacity to manufacture and deliver products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt products to local variations. Suppliers with a global supply chain and efficient manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend as a result of our global manufacturing footprint, highly developed supply chain relationships and track record of success in solving application challenges in our product lines;

▪ | Outsourcing of Design and Manufacturing of Vehicle Parts and Systems: Automotive OEs continually strive to simplify their assembly processes, lower costs and reduce development times. As a result, they have increasingly relied on suppliers to perform many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by automotive OEs. Suppliers with extensive design and engineering capabilities are in the best position to benefit from this trend as they are able to offer value-added solutions with superior features and convenience. We believe certain automotive OEs have sought us out to assist with their engineering challenges to increase towing capacity and for the many solutions provided by our existing products; and


▪ | Shorter Product Development Cycles: Due to frequent shifts in government regulations and customer preferences, OEs are requiring suppliers to continue to provide new designs and product innovations. These trends are prevalent in mature markets as well as, emerging markets, which are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust engineering and development capabilities are best positioned to meet OE demands for rapid innovation. Our broad product offerings, product expertise, and global engineering footprint enables us to rapidly deploy solutions meeting the changing customer needs.

Competitive Strengths
We believe our operating segments share and benefit from the following competitive strengths:

▪ | Diverse Product Portfolio of Market Leading Brands. We believe we benefit from a diverse portfolio of high-quality and highly-engineered products sold under globally recognized and market leading brand names. By offering a wide range of products, we are able to provide a complete solution to satisfy our customers’ towing, trailering and cargo management needs, as well as serve diverse channels through effective brand management. Our brands are well-known in their respective product areas and channels. We believe that we are the leading supplier of towing products and among the leading suppliers of trailering products globally.


▪ | Global Scale with Flexible Manufacturing Footprint and Supply Chain. We were built through internal growth and a series of acquisitions to become the only truly global automotive accessories company with the products we offer. We have the ability to produce low-volume, customized, quick-turn products in our global manufacturing facilities, while our sourcing arrangements with third-party suppliers provides us with the flexibility to manufacture or source high-volume products as end-market demand fluctuates. Our flexible manufacturing capability, low-cost manufacturing facilities and established supply chain allow us to quickly and efficiently respond to changes in end-market demand.


▪ | Long-Term Relationships with a Diverse Customer Base. Our customers encompass a broad range of OEs, mass merchants, e-commerce websites, distributors, dealers, and independent installers, representing multiple channels to reaching the end consumer. Blue chip customers include Ford Motor Company, FCA, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, AutoZone, Amazon, Toyota, Canadian Tire, LKQ, U-Haul, Home Depot and Etrailer, among others. Our customer relationships are well established, with many exceeding 20 years. These strong partnerships can provide stability to our revenue base through economic cycles. We believe Horizon’s diverse product portfolio, global scale and flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to provide a unique value proposition to customers. 


▪ | Globally Competitive Cost Structure. Since becoming an independent public company, we have focused on margin improvement activities, identifying and acting on projects to reduce our cost structure. With focused, identifiable projects under way or complete, we believe we should benefit from improved operating margins and cash flow that can then be deployed to high-value creation activities. The combination of our strong brand names, leading market position, flexible manufacturing and sourcing operations have historically resulted in significant cash flow generation. 


▪ | Experienced Management Team. Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Carl Bizon, who has over 23 years of experience, most recently as the President of Horizon Americas. Prior to the Spin-off, he led TriMas’s international business, including both Europe-Africa and Asia-Pacific, as well as previously serving as Chief Executive Officer of Jayco Corporation. Brian Whittman, a Managing Director with Alvarez & Marsal North Americas, LLC, serves as our interim Chief Financial Officer since joining Horizon in October 2018. He brings more than 20 years of financial,

operational and leadership experience to the role. James Tindell, interim President of Horizon Americas, has over 24 years of financial, operational, and business leadership experience with companies such as Black & Decker and Newell Rubbermaid. Jason Kieseker, President of Horizon Asia‑Pacific and Horizon Europe-Africa, joined the Horizon business in 2001 and has held various leadership roles primarily within our Horizon Asia‑Pacific business. 
Key Business Priorities
Horizon Global established the following strategic platforms for value creation focused on business improvement and transformation, supported by a company culture of continuous improvement.

▪ | Margin Expansion. Our first priority is to drive the organization to a 10% operating margin level. We believe the investments made in our facilities and equipment over the past few years, along with our efforts to realign our operations, should provide the foundation for additional margin expansion. We are developing an organization in which all team members are focused on constantly improving the efficiency of all operations through the adoption of lean and continuous improvement practices. 


▪ | Capital Structure. Our second priority is to improve our capital structure. Our goal is to gradually reduce leverage over time. We aim to accomplish this goal through both margin improvement as well as paying down our fixed obligations, and should we decide to do so, we have a structure in place that allows us to prepay debt in addition to the amortization required under our term debt. 


▪ | Operational Stabilization. Our third priority is to stabilize existing operations after significant management changes and changes in distribution footprint in the Americas and in manufacturing footprint in Europe-Africa during the year. We aim to have our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities operating efficiently and effectively to meet peak demand during our traditional summer selling season in 2019.


▪ | Organic Growth. Our fourth priority is to grow the business 3% to 5% on an organic basis, annually. We have identified five broad areas of focused growth activities, involving geographic markets and sales channels, which we believe are particularly aligned with our competitive strengths. 

Growth Strategies
Prior to becoming an independent public company, Horizon operated on a regional basis under separate management teams, with independent business decisions and resource allocations made by the Horizon Americas, Horizon Asia‑Pacific and Horizon Europe‑Africa leaders. As a public company, we continue to reorganize our global operations to operate as a single combined entity. As a result, we believe that we have multiple opportunities to integrate, improve and grow our business, whether via organic initiatives or via acquisitions of new products or in new geographies, through the following strategies:

▪ | Balanced Original Equipment and Aftermarket growth. The global market for accessories and vehicle personalization is increasing across channels. Automotive manufacturers are looking for suppliers to partner with to create genuine accessories to meet this need. Historically, this has been undertaken as a regional effort, but the growth of global automotive OE has increased the need for global suppliers. Our geographic footprint, existing customer relationships and the increase in global vehicle platforms align to present us with unique opportunities to grow with our automotive OE customers. The Company is positioned to balance and leverage the OE growth with growth in the aftermarket as we have significant brand recognition and strategic distributor and customer relationships. 


▪ | E-commerce. We intend to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and global manufacturing footprint to expand our presence in the high growth e-commerce channel. This strategy is applicable in our developed markets where a focus on content delivery and customer support drive growth. It is also a powerful tool as we look at developing new, less mature markets around the world, enabling a direct connection with the users of our product set. 


▪ | Low Cost Countries. We believe our manufacturing presence in Mexico, Romania and Thailand, provide opportunities for growth, while supporting both new and existing global customers in a cost-effective manner.

 7


▪ | Chinese Market. China is in the early stages of adoption for towing and trailering products. As this adoption rate increases, there is an opportunity for us to bring our experience in the safe use of these products into the market in a meaningful capacity. The rapidly growing middle class, in concert with a developing interest in an outdoor recreational lifestyle, is expected to result in incremental demand for our automotive aftermarket products and accessories. We intend to leverage our existing relationships with global automotive OEs and our global manufacturing and distribution network to expand our sales as the economy continues to develop and expand. 


▪ | Product Innovation. Our presence in the OE channel and multiple geographic markets allows us to leverage development costs and product innovation tied to new vehicles across our entire global footprint. 

Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Horizon employs a dedicated sales force in each of our primary channels. In serving our customers globally, we rely upon our strong historical customer relationships, custom engineering capability, brand recognition, broad product offerings, our established distribution network and varied merchandising strategies to bolster our towing, trailering, cargo management and accessory product sales. Significant Horizon customers include Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors/Holden in the OE channel; Tractor Supply Company and Super Retail Group in the retail channel; and LKQ, U-Haul and Redneck Trailer Supplies in the aftermarket channel. No customer represented greater than 10% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Competition
The competitive environment for automotive accessory products is highly fragmented and is characterized by numerous smaller suppliers, even the largest of which tend to focus in narrow product categories. We believe there is no individual competitor that has the breadth of product portfolio on a global basis in the markets we serve. Significant towing competitors include Curt Manufacturing, B&W Trailer Hitches, The Bosal Group, Brink Group, Buyers Products Company, Demco Products, PullRite, Westin Automotive Products and Camco. Significant trailering competitors include Pacific Rim, Dutton-Lainson, Shelby, Ultra-Fab, Sea-Sense and Atwood. In addition, competition in the cargo management product category primarily comes from Thule, Yakima, Bell, Masterlock and Saris.
Acquisition Strategy
We believe that our businesses have opportunity to grow through disciplined strategic acquisitions. We typically seek bolt-on acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that enhance the strengths of our core businesses. When evaluating acquisition targets, we look for opportunities to expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers and end markets, add new early life cycle technologies, as well as add additional distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
We procure a variety of materials from a global supplier base from around the world. We are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, copper, and aluminum. We also consume a significant amount of energy via utilities in our facilities. Historically, when we have experienced increasing costs of steel, we have successfully passed those through to our customers, although sometimes with a delay due to competitive pressure.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,200 people, of which approximately 11% were located in the United States. In the United States, we have no collective bargaining agreements. Employee relations have generally been satisfactory.
Seasonality and Backlog
We experience some seasonality in our business. Sales of towing and trailering products in the northern hemisphere, where we generate the majority of our sales, are generally stronger in the second and third calendar quarters, as trailer OEs, distributors and retailers acquire product for the spring and summer selling seasons. The Company’s businesses in the southern hemisphere are stronger in the first and fourth calendar quarters. In addition, within the OE channels, there is moderate seasonality due to production schedules and the launch of component production for new vehicle models, which generally occurs in the third calendar quarter of the year. Accordingly, our results reflect any seasonality we may experience. We normally do not consider order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses.

Environmental Matters
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. international increasingly stringent environmental and safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
While we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords, current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.
International Operations
Approximately 55.2% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were derived outside of the United States. We may significantly expand our international operations through organic growth and acquisitions. In addition, approximately 74.0% of our consolidated property and equipment, net as of December 31, 2018 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Romania, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and Thailand.
