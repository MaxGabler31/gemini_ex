Item 1. Business.
Overview:

Throughout this document, references to “Cantel,” “us,” “we,” “our” and the “Company” are references to Cantel Medical Corp. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear the reference is to Cantel Medical Corp. itself and not its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Form 10-K to 2019, 2018, 2017 or “fiscal” 2019, 2018, 2017 or other years refer to our fiscal year ended July 31, of that respective year, and references to “fiscal” 2020 refer to our fiscal year ending July 31, 2020.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we changed the names of our reportable segments to better align with our key customers and the markets we serve. This decision resulted in a change from a financial reporting perspective as the industrial biological and chemical indicator business has moved from the Dental segment to the Life Sciences segment. Prior year segment disclosures have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. 

Cantel is a leading provider of infection prevention products and services in the healthcare market, specializing in the following reportable segments: Medical, Life Sciences, Dental and Dialysis. Most of our equipment, consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections. We operate our four segments through wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States and internationally.
Information Related to Reportable Segments:

Cantel Medical Corp. 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Sales, Marketing and Distribution. We sell and service our full line of endoscopy products through our direct field sales and clinical support service organizations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and Dubai. Elsewhere in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, we sell primarily through independent distribution partners. In China, we sell both directly and through distributors, based on regional market demands.
Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios, market share and global reach, which enable them to offer wide-ranging product bundles to larger customers, such as Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”) and Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”). This competition has the potential to impact our net sales, market share and profit margin. We also compete with a number of small companies with very limited product offerings and operations in one or a limited number of countries. On a product basis, our principal competitors are Steris, Olympus, Boston Scientific, ASP (a division of Fortiv), Metrex, Ruhof, Ecolab, ERBE, Getinge, SteelCo and Wassenburg. We believe that our principal competitive advantages include the strength of our dedicated sales teams, our comprehensive product line of differentiated automated endoscope reprocessors, disposable procedure products and proprietary chemistries, and our reputation for providing high-quality and reliable products supported by our highly responsive clinical support and service teams.
Acquisitions. On March 21, 2018, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Aexis Medical BVBA (“Aexis Medical”), which is based in Belgium. Aexis Medical specializes in advanced software solutions focused on the tracking and monitoring of instrument reprocessing for hospitals and healthcare professionals.
On August 23, 2017, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of BHT Hygienetechnik Holding GmbH (“BHT Group”), a leader in the German market in automated endoscope reprocessing and related equipment and services. BHT Group consists of a portfolio of high-quality automatic endoscope reprocessors, advanced endoscope storage and drying cabinets (products globally distributed by our Company prior to the acquisition under an agreement with BHT Group), washer-disinfectors for central sterile applications, associated technical service and parts as well as flexible endoscope repair services.
Life Sciences
General. Our Life Sciences segment designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and installs water purification systems for medical and other bacteria controlled applications. We also provide filtration/separation and disinfectant technologies to the medical and life science markets through a worldwide distributor network. Our products and services include:

• | central dialysis water purification systems,


• | portable dialysis water purification systems,


• | bicarbonate mixing systems,


• | hollow fiber filters and other filtration and separation products,


• | liquid disinfectants and cold sterilization products,


• | “dry fog” products,


• | room temperature sterilization equipment and services, and


• | clean-room certification and decontamination services.

Our products are generally designed for dialysis and other specific healthcare applications, research laboratories, food and beverage, and commercial industrial customers. Our water systems provide biologically pure water specific to our customers’ needs and site conditions, ranging from low-volume, reverse osmosis (“RO”) and deionization systems, to high-volume, complete turnkey purification systems. We provide service and maintenance for water purification systems through an extensive network of regional offices in the United States and, to a smaller degree, in Canada.
Our expertise includes designing systems capable of delivering water for hemodialysis that meets the water quality standards and good manufacturing standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (“AAMI”) and all grades of U.S. Pharmacopeia (“USP”) water (i.e., water meeting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) enforced standards of the USP including “USP Purified Water,” which is a FDA requirement for the labeling of “purified” bottled water). We also package these same technologies and expertise in industrial designs to meet the commercial industrial market requirements.
We also offer a full line of proprietary and third party filters utilizing hollow fiber membrane technology to remove impurities from liquid streams for a wide range of applications. Such applications include the filtering of ultrapure water to remove endotoxins, bacteria and other contaminants in medical environments to provide protection for patients undergoing treatments that use ultrapure water. Our therapeutic filtration products include hemoconcentrators, hemofilters and specialty filters utilized for therapeutic medical applications.

Cantel Medical Corp. 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Our liquid disinfectant and cold sterilant products are used in the dialysis, medical, pharmaceutical and other industries. These products include surface disinfectants as well as chemistries used to disinfect ultrapure water systems as part of overall procedures to control the contamination of systems by microorganisms and spores. Our “Dry Fog” equipment dispenses our cold sterilant products in a mist form into rooms and certain structures with complex geometries in order to achieve validated surface disinfection.
Our REVOX® Sterilization Systems and Services business provides an innovative room-temperature vapor sterilization method for the medical device, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. It provides customers the capability to sterilize their products at room temperature, through either contract service or on-site agreements, while reducing overall processing times and inventory and capital requirements associated with other industrial sterilization methods.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution. We generally sell our equipment on a direct basis in the United States and Canada and through third-party distributors in other international markets. We are a leading supplier of FDA 510(k) cleared water purification systems to the dialysis industry in North America. A significant portion of our sales in this segment are derived from sales of products and service to dialysis clinics and hospitals in North America.
Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with very limited product offerings and operations in one or a limited number of countries. On a product basis, competitors include Evoqua, IsoPure, Baxter and Steris. We believe that the ability of our Life Sciences segment to successfully compete in the water purification, filtration and disinfectant market derives from our expertise in a FDA regulated environment, our broad product offerings and the high value and quality of our products and our national service coverage.
We have observed a continued trend toward formal or informal bundling partnerships and arrangements between kidney dialysis machine suppliers and companies offering medical water purification systems that compete with our systems. The ability to bundle these products offers a competitive advantage to such suppliers, which include Baxter (dialysis machine)/Gambro (water system), B. Braun (dialysis machine)/Lauer (water system), and Fresenius (dialysis machine)/Vivonic (water system). The bundling approach being used in the United States by B. Braun/Lauer represents a competitive threat to our dialysis water business, as does the business combination of Fresenius and Vivonic. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Acquisitions. On August 1, 2018, we acquired certain net assets of Stericycle Inc. related to its controlled environmental solutions business (“CES Business”). The CES Business is a leading provider of testing and certification, environmental monitoring and decontamination services for clean rooms and other controlled environments to ensure safety, regulatory compliance and quality control.
Dental
General. We design, manufacture, sell, supply and distribute a broad selection of infection prevention healthcare products, the majority of which are single-use products used by dental practitioners. Our products include the following:

• | sterility assurance products such as biological indicators, chemical integrators and sterilization pouches,


• | consumables such as towels, bibs, tray liners and sponges,


• | nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation equipment and related single-use disposable nasal masks,


• | personal barrier products such as face masks, shields, and hand protection products such as hand sanitizers and germicidal wipes,


• | cleaning solutions, high level disinfectants and surface disinfectants,


• | waterline treatment products for maintaining safe dental unit waterlines,


• | amalgam separators,


• | treatment accessories such as saliva ejectors, evacuator tips and plastic cups, and


• | preventatives such as prophy angles and prophy paste.

Significant brand names for our healthcare disposable products include SECURE FIT® Masks, ISOFLUID® Masks, RAPICIDE® Disinfectant and DentaPure® Cartridges.
Our most significant business in this segment derives from our sterility assurance business. We offer both mail-in services and in-office biological monitoring (spore test) systems enabling healthcare professionals to verify the performance of their sterilizers in accordance with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and industry guidelines for daily or weekly testing. Our expanded portfolio in the dental wastewater management market now includes amalgam separator technology which will help dental practitioners meet a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) ruling on wastewater management compliance. Our products also include a wide-array of biological indicators, chemical integrators and related products and services that enable 
(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 5

Cantel Medical Corp. 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K

hospitals, surgical centers, office-based practitioners and dental facilities to safely and accurately monitor and verify their sterilization practices and protocols.
We maintain a leading market position in the United States for face masks and dental unit waterline treatments as well as several of our other products used in the dental market.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution. Our dental products are sold globally to approximately 350 wholesale customers in over 100 countries, with a significant majority located in the United States. Our distribution partners generally include major healthcare distributors, group purchasing organizations and buying co-operatives that sell our products to dental practices, medical facilities, veterinary clinics, and government and educational institutions. The majority of our dental products are sold under the Crosstex brand name. We also produce private label products for several of our distribution partners. 
Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with very limited product offerings. On a product basis, competitors include Halyard Health, 3M, ASP, Steris, Danaher/Sybron, Dentsply/Sultan Healthcare, Amcor, Porter Instrument, Sterisil, ProEdge and less expensive imported generic products from Asia and other lower cost manufacturing locations. We believe that our long-standing brands, product quality, superior customer service and breadth of portfolio are competitive advantages and are the basis for our success in this segment.
Acquisitions. On February 1, 2019, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Omnia S.p.A. (“Omnia”), an Italian-based leader in dental surgical consumables solutions. Omnia’s business consists of a wide-ranging portfolio of sutures, irrigation tubing and customized dental surgical procedure kits, with a focus on procedure room set-up and cross-contamination prevention.
On July 30, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co., LLC (“Hu-Friedy”), a leading global manufacturer of instruments and instrument reprocessing workflow systems serving the dental industry. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close during our first quarter fiscal 2020.
Dialysis
General. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and service reprocessing systems and sterilants for dialyzers (a device serving as an artificial kidney), as well as dialysate concentrates and supplies utilized for renal dialysis. Our renal dialysis products include:

• | hemodialysis concentrates and other ancillary supplies,


• | medical device reprocessing systems, and


• | sterilants and disinfectants.

Our renal dialysis treatment products include a line of acid and bicarbonate concentrates, referred to as dialysate concentrates, used by kidney dialysis centers to prepare dialysate, a chemical solution that draws waste products from the patient’s blood through a dialyzer membrane during the hemodialysis treatment. Dialysate concentrates are used in the dialysis process, whether single-use or reuse dialyzers (described below) are being utilized.
Our dialyzer reprocessing products are limited to use by centers that choose to clean, disinfect and reuse dialyzers for the same patient, known as “dialyzer reuse,” rather than discard the dialyzers after a single use. There has been a significant downward trend in dialyzer reuse since 2001, which has significantly decreased sales of our dialysis products tied to reuse during that period. We are exploring dialysis-related opportunities with the potential to mitigate the loss of such business. Likewise, we are expanding marketing efforts of reuse products in emerging markets in Asia, South America and elsewhere. However, no assurance can be given that such opportunities and efforts will prove successful. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution. Our products are sold in the United States and, to a significantly lesser extent, throughout the world. Our customer base is comprised of large and small dialysis chains as well as independent dialysis clinics. We sell products in the United States primarily through our own direct distribution network, and in many international markets either directly or under various third-party distribution agreements.
Competition. In our Dialysis segment, our most significant competition comes from manufacturers of single-use dialyzers, particularly Fresenius, the largest dialysis chain in the United States and a manufacturer of single-use dialyzers. All or substantially all Fresenius dialysis clinics exclusively use single-use dialyzers and therefore have no need for dialyzer reprocessing equipment.

Information with Respect to Our Business Generally:
Government Regulation
Our business and products are subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the FDA, EPA and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, labeling, sale, storage and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Compliance with applicable government regulations is a significant expense for us. 
Numerous aspects of our business are subject to government regulations including, among other things, research and development, product approvals, product manufacturing, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, record-keeping, storage and disposal practices. For example, the FDA inspects medical device manufacturers for compliance with the current Quality Systems Regulations (“QSRs”), which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, introductions of new medical devices are generally subject to regulatory clearance or approval. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, such clearance or approvals may hurt our competitiveness and have other material adverse consequences on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulations or the interpretation or application of these regulations. However, such governmental regulations could prevent, delay, or result in the revocation or rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. In addition, if we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, fines, sanctions, regulatory actions and other penalties could be imposed on us.
We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse effect on us or on our performance, results, or financial condition. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components and other supplies from numerous suppliers in the United States and abroad. The principal raw materials and supplies that we use to conduct operations include chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components. These raw materials are generally obtainable from several sources and in sufficient quantities within the lead times specified to vendors.
Intellectual Property
We protect our technology and products by, among other means, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of July 31, 2019, we held 68 U.S. patents and 312 foreign patents, with 72 U.S. patents pending and 106 foreign patents pending. The majority of our U.S. and foreign patents, for individual products, are effective for twenty years from the initial filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. In addition, we license from independent third parties under patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, the right to manufacture and sell certain of our products. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses (each of which is long-term) are of material importance to our business.
Our products and services are sold around the world under various trade names, trademarks and brand names. We consider our trade names, trademarks and brand names to be valuable in the marketing of our products in each segment. As of July 31, 2019, we had 2,084 trademark registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries in which we conduct business, as well as 38 trademark applications pending worldwide.
Seasonality
Our businesses generally are not seasonal in nature.

Principal Customers
None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. As described below, none of our segments are reliant upon a single customer, but some of our segments are currently reliant on a few customers. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our Life Sciences segment is reliant on two customers, who collectively accounted for approximately 40.2%, 48.0% and 50.2% of segment net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Our Dental segment is reliant on three customers, who collectively accounted for approximately 47.6%, 45.1% and 43.4% of segment net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to have a similar customer profile after the completion of our pending acquisition of Hu-Friedy, further described in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Our Dialysis segment is reliant on two customers (which are the same two customers noted above under our Life Sciences segment), who collectively accounted for approximately 41.0%, 40.6% and 44.2% of our Dialysis segment net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Backlog
As of July 31, 2019, our consolidated backlog was approximately $102,925 compared with approximately $91,687 as of July 31, 2018. The majority of the backlog was in our Life Sciences segment which had backlog of $50,272 and $58,556 as of July 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, respectively. The majority of our backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of such date.
Competition
The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Important competitive factors generally include breadth of product offering, product design and quality, safety, ease of use, brand, product service and support, and price. We expect to face continued intense competition and believe that the long-term competitive position for all of our segments depends principally on our success in developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services.
Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do, are well-established with reputations for success in the sale and service of their products, and may have certain other competitive advantages over us. However, we believe that the worldwide reputation for the quality and innovation of our products among customers and our reputation for providing quality product service give us a competitive advantage with respect to many of our products.
In addition, certain companies have developed, or may be expected to develop, new technologies or products that directly or indirectly compete with our products. We anticipate that we may face increased competition in the future as new infection prevention products and services enter the market. Numerous organizations are believed to be working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. In addition, a number of companies have developed or are developing disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risks of infection and contamination. There can be no assurance that new products or services developed by our competitors will not be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by us in the future.
For further discussion of competition-related and other risk factors, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Quality Assurance
We manufacture, assemble and package most of our products in the United States and, to a significantly lesser extent, in Italy, Germany and elsewhere. Each of our production facilities is dedicated to particular processes and products. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of our production processes.
Environmental Matters
We anticipate that our compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations, relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

None of our employees are represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Sales to Iran
We ship certain of our products to Iran, and conduct related activities, in accordance with licenses issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Iranian sales were generally conducted through distributors, some of whose customers may include public hospitals owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian government.
