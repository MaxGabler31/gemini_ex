ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
Asure Software, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, headquartered in Austin, Texas, is a leading provider of Human Capital Management (“HCM”) and Workplace Management, offering intuitive and innovative cloud-based solutions designed to help organizations of all sizes and complexities build companies of the future. Our cloud platforms enable more than 100,000 clients worldwide to better manage their people and space in a mobile, digital, multi-generational, and global landscape. Asure’s offerings include a fully-integrated HCM platform, flexible benefits and compliance administration, HR consulting, and time and labor management as well as a full suite of workspace management solutions for conference room scheduling, desk sharing programs, and real estate optimization.
 
Asure’s platform vision is to help clients proactively manage costs associated with their three most expensive assets, real estate, labor and technology, while creating an employee experience that fosters efficiency, productivity and engagement.  Asure serves approximately 10,000 direct clients in 80 countries, ranging from global Fortune 500 clients to small and mid-sized businesses. Some of our current clients include Aetna, Apple Inc., Baker & McKenzie, Fannie Mae, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, KPMG UK, La Trobe University, Merck and Co., Inc., Mondelez, Pfizer, Inc., Pearson, PSSI, Salesforce.com, Inc., State Street and Thomson Reuters. Our mission guides the work we do each day; it is “To deliver innovative technology with the passion to empower every client’s workplace and the commitment to make their workdays easier.”
 
The Asure product strategy is driven by three primary trends in the market:  mobilization, globalization and technology.  Asure offers two product line products:  AsureSpace™ and AsureForce®. Within AsureForce®, we offer AsureHCM, AsureBenefits and AsureConsulting.  AsureSpace™ workplace management solutions enable organizations to optimize their real estate investment and create a digital workplace that empowers mobile and virtual employees, while streamlining internal operations. AsureForce® Time and Labor Management helps organizations optimize their workforce while controlling labor administration costs and activities. The acquisitions of Mangrove Employer Services, Inc. and the assets of Mangrove COBRAsource Inc. in March of 2016 expanded the Asure vision and strategy with the addition of a comprehensive suite for human capital management, including payroll processing and benefits administration services.  In 2017, the Mangrove products, now called AsureHCM, were fully integrated with AsureForce Time creating a seamless offering to manage the complete employee experience.

In January 2017, we completed three strategic acquisitions: Personnel Management Systems, Inc. (“PMSI”), Corporate Payroll, Inc. (Payroll Division) and Payroll Specialties NW, Inc. PMSI, based in Bellevue, Washington, is a provider of outsourced HR solutions. PMSI has been re-branded AsureConsulting and continues to offer full-service HR Outsourcing in the Pacific Northwest region.  Their solution has been expanded to include a national offering, AsureHR Help, a subscription-based offering for HR professionals seeking guidance on common HR related issues.  Corporate Payroll, Inc. (Payroll Division) and Payroll Specialties NW, Inc., are both providers of payroll services and were licensees of the Mangrove payroll system.  These payroll provider acquisitions marked the beginning of a formulaic strategy to acquire businesses already leveraging Asure technologies.
  
In May 2017, we completed two strategic acquisitions: iSystems Intermediate Holdco, Inc. (“iSystems”)  and Compass HRM. iSystems, through its flagship product, Evolution HCM, offers payroll, tax management and HR software combined with comprehensive back-end service bureau tools to service bureau organizations across the United States. Tampa-based Compass HRM is a current reseller of AsureHCM (formerly Mangrove), providing cloud-based human resource management software, including payroll, benefits, time and attendance, and performance management. The acquisition of Compass HRM expands our reach in the Southeast, particularly Florida.
 
In October 2017, we completed the strategic acquisition of Associated Data Services, Inc., a leading regional human resources and payroll services bureau in the Southeast and a current reseller of the Evolution HCM platform.
 
In January 2018, we completed three strategic acquisitions: TelePayroll Inc., a Southern California-based provider of HR, payroll and employee benefits services; Pay Systems of America, Inc., a provider of HR, payroll and employee benefits services based in Tennessee and Iowa; and Savers Administrative Services, Inc., a North Carolina-based certified third-party administrator of payroll and HR services. All three companies are current resellers of Asure’s Evolution HCM platform furthering our strategy of seeking out our own technology and creating an enticing option for service bureau owners with our Partner-For-Life messaging. These new acquisitions provide us with significant customer, product and financial synergies and expand our footprint in the United States in the payroll processing space.

In addition to state-of-the-art hosting platforms and regular software upgrades and releases, Asure gives our clients easy access to our expert support team.

Our sales and marketing strategy targets a wide range of audiences, from small and medium-sized businesses to enterprise organizations throughout the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific.

In May 2017, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Compass HRM, Inc.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
Asure’s SaaS solutions are uniquely designed to help companies bring people, space and assets together to more effectively manage their global, mobile workforces. As companies recruit, hire and work to retain mobile employees, executives use Asure’s solutions to create a fluid employee experience while optimizing their three most expensive assets:  people, real estate and technology.  With five unique product lines, Asure is well-positioned to deliver innovative, scalable solutions across industries and around the world.  With an emphasis on employee engagement, the Asure product team aims to create and deliver easy-to-use solutions that streamline the operational necessities of the workday.  From benefits self-service to reserving a workspace for the day, the Asure product team believes that simplifying required work processes results in an employee experience that is both engaging and productive. Asure product groupings include cloud revenue, hardware revenue, maintenance and support revenue, on premises software license revenue and professional services revenue.
 
AsureSpace™ workspace management solutions offer clients significant costs savings and Return on Investment (“ROI”) gains by maximizing their real estate with a full portfolio of innovative and intuitive SaaS solutions. The AsureSpace platform offers three core products, each of which can stand alone or be bundled together for a comprehensive solution. SmartView® occupancy sensors and analytics platform offers unique insights into how space is being used, allowing companies to make proactive, strategic decisions about real estate investments and workplace design. SmartMove® move management software helps companies design floorplans and track permanent seat assignments as well as manage assets such as telephones, laptops, desks, chairs, and virtually any item assigned to an employee. AsureSpace™ Resource Scheduler is the foundation of the AsureSpace platform with a sophisticated yet intuitive approach to workspace management. Featuring conference room and desk reservations, service management, interactive floorplans, visitor management, calendar and web conference integrations and robust reporting, Resource Scheduler is a comprehensive solution for the digital workplace.  NowSpace®, a mobile app for Apple and Android devices empowers mobile workers to find and reserve desks and conference rooms directly from their smart phones. AsureSpace™ touch panels and kiosks are placed outside busy areas for on-the-fly desk and space reservations, while lending a high-tech presence to a standard office and enhancing the visitor experience.

AsureHCM is an integrated cloud-based solution that provides a foundation for our clients’ digital HR strategy.  From traditional human resource (“HR”) management and payroll to benefits, talent acquisition and performance management, AsureHCM provides an easy-to-use platform for HR professionals and employees alike.  Our emphasis on employee self-service and automated processes reflects the growing trend of workforce mobilization while empowering HR teams to focus on more strategic initiatives. Our HCM suite of solutions are easy-to-use with fully integrated HR/payroll applications uniquely designed to help companies recruit, manage, pay, and analyze their workforce more effectively.  Combined with the AsureBenefits offering of COBRA administration and consumer spending accounts, and AsureHR Help for professional guidance on HR challenges, AsureHCM is a comprehensive platform that delivers a cohesive and engaging experience throughout the employee life cycle.
 
Asure’s SMB HCM Channel product, Evolution HCM, was developed with the channel market in mind.  Its fully integrated Payroll, HR, and Tax Management suite offers service providers a path to growth and success with unparalleled accuracy, productivity, and financial control. Evolution HCM provides its users the flexibility and best practices to handle clients of all size and complexity levels, as well as meet the ever-evolving needs of the industry.
 
AsureConsulting allows our SMB clients to run their businesses because we take on the responsibility for all the traditional Human Resource functions. Our suite of services assists organizations through the entire employee lifecycle – from finding the right people, to on-boarding, to development and performance management and finally, to exit strategies and separation. Everything for the SMB market, seamlessly integrated.
 
Cost savings and additional ROI gains come in the form of a more strategic use of labor dollars and the elimination of time theft with AsureForce® workforce management solutions.  Mobile time tracking with AsureForce Mobile helps executives better understand where and when their employees are working, providing insight into labor schedules and labor costs. With AsureForce Mobile, employees can punch in and out from remote locations, and geo-positioning verifies the physical coordinates.  Biometric time clocks, including facial recognition, reduce time theft and help combat buddy punching, which can cost companies millions of dollars per year. Automated system notifications, real-time dashboards, and flexible configuration options all work to streamline operations.  Finally, employees, supervisors and executives have real-time access to data and business intelligence to optimize labor costing, improve labor scheduling, and ultimately control labor costs.
 
Our acquisitions have enabled us to disrupt the HCM market by offering a comprehensive solution that brings workforce and workspace management together. Empowering HR professionals to partner with real estate management teams and take a more strategic role in company initiatives ultimately results in a work environment that is productive, efficient and most importantly, engaging for employees.  An optimized employee experience delivered through a unified, cloud-based management platform increases company bottom-line performance and gives executives new insight into their most costly assets: people and real estate.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
Asure strives to quickly bring to market innovative, cloud-based solutions that reflect the workstyle of the modern, mobile workforce. First-to-market mobile applications are a testament to our success in innovation. Additionally, Asure is committed to co-innovation, working in partnership with industry leaders, partners and clients around the globe to develop technology solutions that meet the needs of a rapidly shifting workplace.
 
Our industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology, resulting in the frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, changes in customer needs and continual improvement in product performance characteristics.   Asure strives to be cost-effective and timely in enhancing our software applications, developing new innovative software solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of an evolving range of customers, and anticipating technological advances while adhering to industry standards.
 
Asure development teams – located in Traverse City, Michigan; Tampa, Florida; Burlington, Vermont; as well as the United Kingdom – are staffed with software developers, quality assurance engineers and support specialists who work closely with our customers and sales and marketing teams to build products and services based on market requirements and customer feedback.  We develop our new product and service roadmaps based on inputs from customers, competitive comparisons and relevant technology innovations. 
 
Our research and development strategy is rooted in innovation and flexibility. The development team enhances the functionality of our software and hardware products through new releases and new feature developments, with a particular focus on SaaS solutions and products for the mobile workforce and the digital workplace.  Asure will continue to evaluate opportunities for developing new software so that organizations can further streamline and automate the tasks associated with administering their businesses.  We seek to simultaneously allow organizations to improve their productivity while reducing the costs associated with those business tasks.

We also actively search for potential product, service or business acquisitions that we believe will complement our existing and planned product and service offerings, such as our 2017 acquisition of iSystem’s Evolution HCM product suite for small and midsize (“SMB”) and channel markets.  We cannot guarantee that we will make future acquisitions or that we can successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses profitably into Asure.
 
Despite our efforts, we also cannot guarantee that we will complete our existing and future development efforts or that our new and enhanced software products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance.  Additionally, Asure may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development or introduction of new or enhanced software products.  In the case of acquiring new or complementary software products or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquisitions into our current product lines.  Furthermore, despite extensive testing, errors may be found in new software products or releases after shipment, resulting in a diversion of development resources, increased service costs, loss of revenue and/or delay in market acceptance.
 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Asure sells its software products and services through both a direct and channel (partner) model, which enables us to sell our software solutions in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Prospective customers learn about Asure through a variety of ways, including advertising, web site searches, sales calls, public relations, direct marketing and social media.  When prospective customers show an interest in Asure, we connect them with a sales representative via our web site, phone or a face-to-face meeting to discuss their needs and the solutions they are interested in and make the sale.  We track our marketing and sales activities to provide immediate preview into activities, leads and pipeline opportunities. Asure account management teams also work with existing customers to promote and sell additional solutions that are relevant for each customer. In addition to this direct sales model, we supplement these efforts with our partner programs described below.  By working with our partners, we expand the reach of our direct sales force and gain access to key opportunities in major market segments worldwide.  Asure has two distinct levels of partners in our Partner Program: Reseller Partners and Referral Partners.
Reseller Partners. Reseller Partners are companies that represent us globally, as well as before the Federal government, and often offer complementary products to either the workspace management product line or the workforce product line.  Reseller Partners commit to a minimum level of business per year with us and receive a channel discount for that commitment.  Our Reseller Partners outside the United States include JLL, Red River Technology and Kathea, which represent the workspace product line.  We also have several Reseller Partners that represent our software in the Federal government space.  Resellers of our workforce product line in the United States include Oasis Outsourcing, a large provider of human resource outsourcing solutions. 
Referral Partners.  Referral Partners provide us with the name and particular information about a prospective customer and its needs as a sales lead.  If we accept the sales lead, we register it for the Referral Partner.  If we make a sale as a direct result of such a lead, we will pay the Referral Partner a sales lead referral fee.  Currently, we have a number of Referral Partners, including Atmosphere Interiors PPI, BuildingI, Martek and SHI for the workspace management product and our workforce product line.
COMPETITION
 
We believe we have a unique position in the market place as the only technology provider in the world that offers cloud-based workspace and workforce management solutions from a single partner. Additionally, Asure has been first-to-market with mobile apps in the workspace management industry, and we are the only known company to have both geospatial and facial recognition technology working together for mobile time tracking.
 
Specific to the AsureSpace™ line of workspace management software solutions, we have a competitive advantage in the breadth of our complementary workspace management solutions and the scope of our analytics as well as our resources available for product development, client services, and client support.  The primary competitors to AsureSpace™ include Dean Evans & Associates, Inc., AgilQuest Corporation and Condeco Ltd. (UK).  In addition to our features and available services, we believe the principal competitive advantages of AsureSpace™ include its cloud-based service model, extensive product integration options and partner channel, scalable deployments, configurable interfaces, mobile access and price.  Our expert services team, proven implementation methodology and “partner v. vendor” approach have also shown to be critical differentiators.
 
The AsureForce® line of workforce management software solutions has a competitive advantage in the marketplace in serving organizations seeking specific point-solutions as well as organizations desiring an integrated suite of solutions, particularly in the area of mobile time collection. The AsureForce Mobile and AirClock™ products are first-to-market technology solutions with significant market demand. By competing tactically with point-solutions and strategically with an integrated suite of solutions, Asure can serve the needs of a broad spectrum of companies. Primary competitors to AsureForce® include Kronos, Replicon, and Time Simplicity.

Our key competitive advantage in the HCM product line is our single database architecture.  Many HCM providers offer ‘integrated’ solutions meaning multiple databases and redundant data entry.  AsureHCM offers a single employee record throughout the entire employee life cycle, starting with an online job application.  Other differentiating factors include our intuitive user interface with mobile accessibility, an integrated time and labor solution, and   streamlined workflows with automated notifications and self-service options throughout.  With a complementary suite of HR products such as consumer spending accounts and HR Help, AsureHCM offers a comprehensive platform to advance an organization’s HR strategy.   Within the Evolution SBO channel, differentiators include a robust back-end solution for payroll and tax management and with the Asure acquisition, access to a full suite of ancillary products and the long-term advantage of our Partner-For-Life mentality.  SBOs can continue as an Asure licensee with the opportunity to expand their available offerings, or they can come under the Asure umbrella and experience the full benefit of a forward-thinking technology company.
 
 Competitors in the HCM market tend to fluctuate, however, our main competitors are ADP, Kronos, Paylocity, Ultimate Software, Ceridian, Ascentis and Infinisource.


While Asure has the advantage of a flexible, easy to use, cloud-based, SaaS-delivered software model, affordability and proven deployment methodology, we face several categories of competitive challenges:
 
 
· | Vendors with face-to-face sales contact. In this highly relationship-based sales process, vendors with large, dispersed field-based sales teams who meet and consult with prospects have an advantage. Key U.S. vendors who approach the market in this manner include ADP, Kronos, PeopleSoft and Condeco. Asure has recently launched a field-based approach to sales and also focuses on high-touch marketing campaigns and leveraging relationships with channel partners to build relationships with prospects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | National payroll processors with loss-leader products. Large brand and market share payroll processing vendors (such as ADP, Inc.) offer equivalent point solutions at little or no cost to prospects when in a competitive engagement because these loss leader products become inconsequential next to their core business offerings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Single application vendors. Vendors that offer similar point-solutions, such as room scheduling, office hoteling management, time and attendance, employee/manager self-service and paystub management, can be perceived as better meeting an immediate and specific need.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Because the market for our products and services is subject to rapid technological change and there are relatively low barriers to entry in the workplace management software market, we routinely encounter new entrants or competition from vendors in some or all aspects of our product lines. Competition from these potential market entrants may take many forms. Some of our competitors, both current and future, may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.  As a result, they may compete more effectively on price and other terms.  Additionally, those competitors may devote greater resources in developing products or in promoting and selling their products to achieve greater market acceptance.  Asure is actively taking measures designed to address our competitive challenges, and clients tend to recognize the benefits of working with an established and publicly-traded partner versus a start-up or transitional vendor.  However, we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve or maintain a competitive advantage with respect to any of the competitive factors.
 
MARKETING
 
Asure’s marketing strategy relies on a comprehensive integrated plan rooted in our business objectives.  Our marketing plan includes four primary objectives: 1) build brand awareness, 2) develop lead generation programs that drive revenue, 3) launch products in a meaningful way and 4) develop an infrastructure that supports and measures marketing activities. We deploy multi-faceted, multi-series direct marketing programs to drive awareness, interest and revenue. Marketing vehicles include our web site, organic and paid search, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, events, social media, content marketing and eMarketing.  In 2018, we are expanding our strategy to include Account Based Marketing and vertical-specific marketing.   Our marketing plan addresses growth and retention goals for all target audiences, from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies and divisions of enterprise organizations throughout the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific.  
SALES ENABLEMENT
 
In 2017, Asure developed a comprehensive Sales Enablement plan to drive revenue through the education and development of direct and channel sales teams.  With an emphasis on social selling, sales enablement tools DiscoverOrg and LinkedIn Navigator are elevating prospecting and top of funnel sales activity with meaningful connections, targeted research and the distribution of relevant content.  Sales teams also have access to a sophisticated ROI calculator that enhances the discovery process and creates a demonstrable ROI with interactive components that allow prospect champions to build a case internally, expediting the sales cycle.  In conjunction with our marketing and product management team, our sales enablement team is promoting a consultative sales approach that demonstrates our commitment as a partner with a focus on in-depth understanding of products, use cases and industries.

INDUSTRY REGULATION
 
Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.
 
As a provider of HR outsourcing solutions, we process personal and sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and data security-related laws. For instance, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our COBRA, flexible spending account, and health savings account benefits administration services businesses. We are also subject to federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.
 
Some of our solutions assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them.  For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services in the United States are designed to help our clients comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers’ benefits continuation obligations and certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to us, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.
 
Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, Canada, the European Union and elsewhere may impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. For example, the European Union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation (the “GDPR”) in May 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation.  The GDPR becomes fully effective in May 2018. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. Failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences
 
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business.
