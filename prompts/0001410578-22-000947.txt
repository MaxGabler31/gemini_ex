Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing transformational therapeutics for serious diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our mission is to improve patient outcomes and save lives. We have been focusing our development efforts on our immuno-oncology programs. In September 2021, we announced the launch of Duet BioTherapeutics (“Duet”). Duet integrates the management and clinical development of the immunotherapy assets of Scopus and Olimmune Inc. (the “Duet Platform”). Duet BioTherapeutics, formerly Olimmune, was acquired by Scopus in June 2021.
The Duet Platform relies on a novel approach to immuno-oncology with a suite of bifunctional oligonucleotides that activate antigen-presenting cells (“APCs”) within the tumor microenvironment, while alleviating tumor immunosuppression to jump-start T cell-mediated immune responses. The unique mechanism-of-action of these synthetic oligonucleotides comes from simultaneously targeting two intracellular immune pathways – signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (“STAT3”), a master immune checkpoint inhibitor, and toll-like receptor 9 (“TLR9”). The targeted inhibition of STAT3 reawakens immune cells and allows for the full potential of TLR9-driven innate and adaptive immune responses.
The Duet Platform is comprised of three distinctive, complementary CpG-STAT3 inhibitors:

· | RNA silencing | CpG-STAT3siRNA | (“DUET-01”)
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
· | Antisense | CpG-STAT3ASO | (“DUET-02”)
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
· | DNA-binding inhibitor | CpG-STAT3decoy | (“DUET-03”)

​
DUET-01 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial, as a monotherapy, for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). On March 2, 2022, the clinical trial sponsor publicly updated to May 2022 the possible start date for enrollment. The design of the existing investigator-sponsored clinical protocol for DUET-01, including the number of study visits, together with constraints on mobility and travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused delays in enrollment. The company has been engaged in ongoing discussions with the sponsor, who has been evaluating the applicable protocol with a view to reducing and/or more closely concentrating subject visits. As a small interfering RNA (“siRNA”)-based technology, DUET-01 is delivered intratumorally. Pursuant to a sponsored research agreement, research is being initiated to evaluate increasing the stability of novel siRNA-based molecules to enable systemic delivery. DUET-02 is being developed for systemic delivery. We are, through Duet, developing DUET-02, which has a similar mechanism of action to DUET-01, except the STAT3 inhibitor is an antisense (“ASO”) RNA molecule rather than a small interfering RNA (“siRNA”). The STAT3ASO molecule binds directly to the STAT3 mRNA, recruiting ribonuclease H1 (“RNase H1”) to degrade the STAT3 mRNA. The use of ASO permits other chemical modifications resulting in greater stability in human blood. This allows for systemic treatment of harder-to-reach solid tumors such as prostate or kidney cancers. Dose-range finding studies, good laboratory practice (“GLP”) toxicology studies, and good manufacturing process (“GMP”) manufacturing of the drug substance and product are all currently in process. Duet expects to file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for DUET-02 in Q4 2022 in advanced solid malignancies, with Phase 1 clinical trials anticipated to begin in Q1 2023 in the United States. DUET-03 uses an alternative to the destruction of mRNA to silence STAT3 activity, such as with DUET-01 and DUET-02, instead targeting the actual STAT3 transcription factor protein. Duet is also evaluating combination therapies with checkpoint inhibitors. On an ongoing basis, the company continues to refine, update and enhance its immuno-oncology pipeline and target indications, including prioritizing solid tumor indications. The company also continually evaluates the possibilities of additional studies with a view to enhancing, among other things, the effectiveness and method of delivery of our drug candidates and identifying additional protections for our intellectual property.
The company has licenses for additional drug candidates, including drug candidates targeting systemic sclerosis (“SSc”) and other fibrotic conditions and opioid-sparing pain treatments. As a result of the company’s increased emphasis on its immuno-oncology programs and other considerations, we have been continuing to reduce allocations of resources to other programs.

Recent Developments
Sponsored Research Agreement with Dr. Kortylewski
On April 7, 2022, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with City of Hope (“COH”) for research to be conducted by Marcin Kortylewski, Ph.D., a Co-Founder and Senior Advisor of Duet and Professor in the Department of Immuno-Oncology at COH (the “Kortylewski SRA”). Pursuant to the Kortylewski SRA, Dr. Kortylewski and his lab will be evaluating novel chemical structures and formulations to increase the stability of siRNA-based molecules to enable systemic delivery.
Litigation and Proxy Contest
The company is involved in litigation initiated by or against certain current and former officers and/or directors and, as the case may be, certain family members (the “Adverse Parties”). In connection with the issues in dispute in such litigation and certain related matters, including disputes relating to ownership and transferability of shares of our common stock (the “Delaware Litigation”), the company was subject to a proxy contest (the “Proxy Contest”) relating to its 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (“2021 Annual Meeting”). The outcome of the 2021 Annual Meeting is currently subject to an action pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General Corporation Law challenging the election results (the “Section 225 Action”). The Section 225 Action and certain of the other pending litigations have been consolidated into a single action in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Chancery Court”). Separately, the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), with the assistance of outside counsel, conducted an internal review of the actions of two Board members, one of whom is the company’s former president. As a result of the review, the company terminated the employment of its former president in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, pursuant to which the company has no further financial obligations, and the Audit and Executive Committees requested the resignation from the Board of both directors. Such directors have refused to resign. In addition, our former president filed a lawsuit claiming, among other things, that he was wrongfully terminated by the company. Further, counsel for one of these directors sent a letter to the Board in which he claims that the company had made defamatory statements against such director.
On October 26, 2021, the Adverse Parties jointly filed a stockholder derivative lawsuit (the “Derivative Complaint”), purportedly on behalf of the company, against all of the other members of the Board and certain affiliates in the Chancery Court. On November 12, 2021, the company filed a motion to dismiss the Derivative Complaint. On March 11, 2022, the Chancery Court dismissed the Derivative Complaint.
The Adverse Parties litigation and Proxy Contest have and continue to disrupt the functioning of the company and have had a material adverse effect on the company, including its financial condition, management of day-to-day operations and functioning of its Board. The company has been compelled to commit significant resources to defend against the Adverse Parties litigation and Proxy Contest. The company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes significant fees, costs and/or expenses relating to the Delaware Litigation and the Proxy Contest, which account for a material portion of the year-over-year increase in such net loss. The company is currently unable to determine the impact and cost of the continuing Delaware Litigation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and, although the company has prevailed in the Derivative Complaint and believes it has meritorious defenses in the remaining Delaware Litigation, there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any future litigation. The company will require significant additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Capitalization and Stock Price Matters
Our ability to issue shares of common stock is currently impeded due to a lack of a sufficient number of authorized shares of common stock, which constrains our ability to raise capital. Increasing the authorized number of shares requires stockholder approval. Due to disagreements with the Adverse Parties and affiliated and/or related stockholders, including certain family members (collectively, the “Adverse Stockholders”), the company may continue to be unable to obtain stockholder approval on a timely basis, or at all.

The trading price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq (“Trading Price”) has declined precipitously. The closing trading prices on March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 were approximately $8.45 and $0.69, respectively. Such decline has likely resulted from a confluence of factors, including a significant decline in the overall market and the small-cap biotechnology sector. We believe that other contributing factors include: the Adverse Parties litigation and the Proxy Contest. Further, we believe the Adverse Parties litigation and Proxy Contest was a principal cause of the company’s loss of research coverage and interest. These factors also contributed to the dilution associated with our recent financing. We will require substantial additional financing to develop our drug candidates and to fund operations, including fees, costs and expenses associated with the Adverse Parties litigation. It can be expected that financings in the foreseeable future will also be highly dilutive. Additional financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations.
Results of 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
The company was subject to a Proxy Contest relating to its 2021 Annual Meeting. As previously disclosed in our amended Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 10, 2022 (the “Annual Meeting 8-K”), the final voting results are subject to the Section 225 Action challenging the results of the Annual Meeting, on the basis that, among other things, that certain of the Adverse Stockholders improperly voted shares of the company’s common stock at the Annual Meeting over which such parties improperly and incorrectly claimed ownership (the “Disputed Shares”). Without such votes, the Adverse Stockholders would not have succeeded at the Annual Meeting given that an overwhelming majority (of more than 90%) of unaffiliated stockholders’ votes were in favor of the incumbent directors. Accordingly, the Adverse Parties slate of directors would have been defeated and the incumbent directors would have retained their seats. 
Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee selected Citrin Cooperman & Company, LLP (“Citrin”) as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The company submitted the selection of the independent registered public accountants for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Stockholder ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our bylaws or otherwise. However, the company submitted the selection of Citrin to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.
On February 16, 2022, the Audit Committee was informed by its prior independent registered public accounting firm, Citrin, of its decision to decline reappointment as the company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2021. The independent registered public accounting firm reports of Citrin on the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that the audit reports contained a paragraph indicating that there was substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and subsequent interim periods through February 16, 2022, there were no disagreements with Citrin on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to Citrin’s satisfaction would have caused Citrin to make reference thereto in connection with their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and subsequent interim periods through February 16, 2022, there were no reportable events of the types described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
On February 18, 2022, the company disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K that “[t]he Audit Committee has begun the process of searching for a new registered independent public accounting firm and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K upon the engagement of a new firm. No assurance can be given as to when a new firm might be selected, including whether one will be engaged to enable the Company to file its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 in a timely manner.” 
On February 24, 2022, the company engaged Wolf & Company, P.C. (“Wolf”) as the company’s new independent registered public accounting firm as authorized by the company’s Audit Committee. During the company’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and for the subsequent interim period through February 24, 2022, neither the company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Wolf regarding any of the matters set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of Regulation S-K of the rules and regulations of the SEC.
The change in auditor has and will continue to have the effect of increasing the time and cost associated with preparing, finalizing and filing the company’s reports with the SEC, including this Annual Report and any future filings containing financial

information previously audited by the company’s prior independent registered public accounting firm. Failure to timely file required filings with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on the company.
Nasdaq Notices
As a result of the decline in the trading price for our common stock and the composition of the Board resulting from the Proxy Contest, the company received deficiency letters from Nasdaq relating to non-compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements (the “Nasdaq Notices”). The Nasdaq Notices identify deficiencies with respect to requirements for (i) minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS Requirement”), (ii) minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (“MVPHS Requirement”), (iii) majority of independent directors (“Majority Independent Requirement”), (iv) Audit and Compensation Committee composition (“Committees Requirement”), and (v) minimum closing bid price (“Bid Price Requirement” and, together with the MVLS Requirement, MVPHS Requirement, Majority Independent Requirement, and Committees Requirement, the “Listing Requirements”). Under Nasdaq rules, the company has a cure period of 180 days from the date of each respective Nasdaq Notice to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement, the MVPHS Requirement and Bid Price Requirement. Such 180-day cure periods expire on July 12, 2022, August 30, 2022 and October 4, 2022, respectively. The Committees Requirement provides a cure period to regain compliance: (i) until the earlier of the company’s next annual stockholders’ meeting or January 5, 2023, or (ii) if the next annual stockholders’ meeting is held before July 5, 2022, then the company must evidence compliance no later than July 5, 2022. The Majority Independent Requirement requires the company to submit to Nasdaq a plan for regaining compliance within 45 days of the date of the Nasdaq Notice, or May 2, 2022. If such plan is accepted, Nasdaq can grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Nasdaq Notice for the Majority Independent Requirement for the company to evidence compliance. While the company believes that it can regain compliance with each of the Listing Requirements, there can be no assurance that the company will be able do so within the prescribed periods, or at all. Our common stock could become subject to delisting from Nasdaq if we fail to regain compliance.
The Duet Platform
We have entered into three licenses, a sponsored research agreement and a clinical research support agreement relating to the Duet Platform with COH, a world-renowned, independent biomedical research and treatment center for cancer and other life-threatening diseases.
The Duet Platform is comprised of three distinctive, complementary bifunctional oligonucleotides that each consist of a TLR9 agonist (i.e., CpG ODN) linked with a STAT3 inhibitor (Figure 1):

· | RNA silencing | CpG-STAT3siRNA | (“DUET-01”)
--+-----------------------+----------------+------------
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
· | Antisense | CpG-STAT3ASO | (“DUET-02”)
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
· | DNA-binding inhibitor | CpG-STAT3decoy | (“DUET-03”)

​
One of the most sought-after therapeutic targets in cancer is STAT3, an oncogenic transcription factor and a master regulator of immunosuppression. STAT3 is a well-known driver of malignant cell invasion, proliferation, and metastasis in most human cancers. To date, STAT3 has remained undruggable. While numerous STAT3-based therapies have made it into the clinic, there have been no FDA approvals to date. The primary reason STAT3 has remained undruggable is that it’s an intracellular target, making it highly difficult to access. Duet’s approach to make STAT3 druggable is to combine the STAT3 inhibitor with a CpG DNA recognized by the immune receptor, TLR9. Tethering STAT3 to CpG allows for intracellular delivery of the whole molecule and for triggering potent antitumor immune responses.
Figure 1. The Duet Platform. Each molecule in the Duet Platform consists of a TLR9 agonist (i.e., unmethylated CpG sequence) that is chemically linked to a STAT3 inhibitor. The STAT3 inhibitor takes three different forms, as described in the table above.
CpG oligonucleotides serve as a common “danger signal” of bacterial or viral infections detected by TLR9 receptors. Duet links a synthetic CpG oligonucleotide to a STAT3 inhibitor to:

1. | Select the right immune cell types – CpG oligonucleotides are rapidly internalized (~30 minutes) by APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Stimulate immune signaling – Once the CpG-STAT3 inhibitor is internalized by APCs, CpG binds to an intracellular TLR9 receptor, stimulating immune signaling.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Silence STAT3 activity and unleash TLR9-mediated immune responses – The CpG-STAT3 inhibitor molecule is rapidly released into the cytosol, releasing STAT3 immunosuppressive control over TLR9 signaling, thereby maximizing tumor antigen presentation and T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DUET-01
We are currently developing DUET-01 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
DUET-01 consists of a CpG oligonucleotide linked to a siRNA inhibitor of STAT3 (i.e., CpG-STAT2siRNA). Scavenger receptors that are highly expressed in specific immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells and macrophages) have a high affinity for the CpG sequence, allowing for targeted uptake of DUET-01 and internalization within the endosomes. The CpG sequence then binds to TLR9, triggering an innate immune response. The DUET-01 molecule is then rapidly released into the cytosol, through a TLR9-facilitated process, where the STAT3siRNA combines with the RNA-induced signaling complex (RISC) and degrades STAT3 mRNA (Figure 2).

Figure 2. The siRNA mechanism of action. The STAT3 siRNA combines with the RNA-induced signaling complex (RISC), which results in rapid and potent degradation of STAT3 mRNA. This approach – binding of an RNA molecule with a RISC complex – takes advantage of a naturally-occurring gene silencing pathway built into the mammalian cell.
STAT3 is frequently upregulated in NHL and is associated with poor survival rates in patients with aggressive forms of lymphoma (e.g., Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) is a group of blood cancers originating in either B-cells (approximately 85% of all NHL or T-cells (approximately 15% of all NHL). The American Cancer Society estimates the incidence of NHL to be over 77,000 patients annually in the United States. NHL is characterized into subtypes according to the natural course of disease progression. Aggressive lymphomas, which account for 60% of all NHL cases, progress rapidly. DLBCL is the most common of these aggressive subtypes, with only an approximate 40% 5-year overall survival even with combined chemo-immunotherapy, where more effective treatments are needed. Duet is additionally exploring opportunities of using DUET-01 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
In connection with the integration of management and clinical development of our immunotherapy assets subsequent to our acquisition of Olimmune, CpG-STAT3siRNA, which the company had previously referred to as CO-sTiRNATM for ease of reference, was redesignated as DUET-01.

DUET-02
While it has been suggested that siRNA-based technologies have superior potency for inhibition of gene expression compared to other oligonucleotides, siRNAs are typically not as amenable to systemic administration as serum endonucleases rapidly degrade the siRNA molecules when delivered intravenously or subcutaneously. This limits their utility to local, intratumoral delivery in immuno-oncology. 
To address metastatic solid tumor cancers using systemic administration, Duet is developing DUET-02, which has a similar mechanism of action to DUET-01 except the STAT3 inhibitor is an antisense (ASO) RNA molecule rather than an siRNA. The STAT3ASO molecule binds directly to the STAT3 mRNA, recruiting ribonuclease H1, or RNase H1, to degrade the STAT3 mRNA (Figure 3). The use of ASO permits other chemical modifications resulting in greater stability in human blood. This allows for systemic treatment of harder-to-reach solid tumors such as prostate or kidney cancers.

Figure 3. The ASO mechanism of action. The STAT3 ASO binds directly to STAT3 mRNA, recruiting RNase H1 to degrade the STAT3 mRNA. While it has been suggested that ASO oligonucleotides provide less potent gene silencing than siRNAs, this has difference in potency has not been established in vivo. Additionally, ASO molecules have the added benefit of being very stable in serum, allowing for systemic administration.
Although Duet has seen significant effect using DUET-02 in pre-clinical proof of concept studies for genitourinary cancers, such as metastatic prostate cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the company is taking a broader approach in its clinical evaluation of this therapeutic agent. The initial clinical trial will be designed as an open-label, sequential groups Phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid malignancies that are refractory to established therapies known to provide clinical benefit. Dose-range finding studies, GLP toxicology studies, and GMP manufacturing of the drug substance and product are all underway. The IND application for this clinical trial is expected to be submitted in Q4 2022, with trial enrollment anticipated to begin in Q1 2023.
DUET-03
STAT3 is a transcription factor whose normal activity in epithelial and immune cells is critical for wound healing and tissue repair. However, tumor cells hijack this functional pathway within the tumor microenvironment to mimic a neoplastic and inflammation-driven repair response that promotes tumor progression. An alternative to destruction of mRNA to silence STAT3 activity, such as with DUET-01 and DUET-02, is to target the actual STAT3 transcription factor protein. 
DUET-03 combines a unmethylated CpG sequence to a STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3decoy). The STAT3decoy binds directly to the STAT3 protein, using a competitive binding approach and limiting the binding of the STAT3 transcription factor to the transcription factor binding site (Fig. 4). Duet is exploring opportunities where this alternative STAT3 silencing approach may be therapeutically beneficial over DUET-01 or DUET-02. Initial data in hematological malignancies, including B cell NHL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) suggest strong therapeutic potential.

Figure 4. The decoy mechanism of action. Instead of targeting the mRNA, the STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide engages in competitive binding with the STAT3 protein, limiting the ability of STAT3 to engage transcription factor binding sites and reducing pathways that increase tumor progression.
Duet Platform Licenses and Other Arrangements
Exclusive License Agreement for CpG-STAT3siRNA (DUET-01)
We acquired exclusive, worldwide rights from COH for CpG-STAT3siRNA (the “siRNA Exclusive License Agreement”), including the patent rights and associated know-how. Under the COH License Agreement, we are required to commercially develop DUET-01, including through all phases of clinical trials, and to eventually obtain marketing approval. Upon the grant of the COH License Agreement, we paid COH an upfront license fee and reimbursed certain patent fees and expenses in an aggregate amount of approximately $284,000, and issued 200,000 shares of our common stock and 47,965 of our W warrants. Over the course of the COH License Agreement, we are required to attain certain diligence milestones and are obligated to raise a prescribed amount of capital to support the costs associated with development of DUET-01. We also are required to make development milestone payments, which total approximately $3.5 million in the aggregate, for each indication. These milestone payments are tied to achieving certain clinical milestones and obtaining marketing approvals. We also must make sales milestone payments tied to achieving net sales starting at $50 million in a year up to $1 billion in a year, which payments total $57.5 million in the aggregate. We are also subject to paying base royalties on sales, such royalty rate being a mid-single digit percentage of sales, subject to minimum annual royalties. Royalty terms are determined on a country-by-country basis and extend to the later of 15 years following the expiration of patent protection in such country or, in cases of know-how, 15 years from the first commercial sale. Starting in 2021, we also must pay an annual license maintenance fee, such fee being less than $50,000 per year, which will be a credit against base royalties in a license year once we become obligated to pay such royalties in a license year. The COH License Agreement is subject to termination upon an uncured material breach by either party or our bankruptcy.
Clinical Research Support Agreement for CpG-STAT3siRNA (DUET-01)
In March 2021, the company paid to COH approximately $1.2 million relating to the clinical lot manufacturing and IND preparation costs for CpG-STAT3siRNA and agreed to pay $10,000 per month to COH for certain project management and regulatory services relating to the preparation of the IND for CpG-STAT3siRNA until such IND was filed with the FDA, which occurred in April 2021. Further, the company incurred costs of approximately $333,807 during the year ended December 31, 2021, pursuant to a clinical research support agreement (the “CRSA) relating to the Phase 1 clinical trial for CpG-STAT3siRNA to be conducted at COH.
Sponsored Research Agreement with Dr. Kortylewski
On April 7, 2022, we entered into the Kortylewski SRA with COH for research to be conducted by Dr. Kortylewski. siRNA-based therapeutics have shown potent biological effect in pre-clinical models of various cancers. The inherent characteristics of these molecules, however, result in rapid degradation by endonucleases in human serum. This degradation necessitates intratumoral delivery. 

7



The research being initiated under the Kortylewski SRA is to evaluate novel chemical structures and formulations, including lipid nanoparticles, to increase the stability of siRNA-based molecules in serum to allow for systemic delivery. The research under the Kortylewski SRA is expected to be conducted over a two-year period at a cost of approximately $200,000 per year. Duet owns a non-exclusive license, as well as a right to enter into an exclusive license for any new inventions or intellectual property resulting from the research conducted under the Kortylewski SRA.
Exclusive License Agreement for CpG-STAT3ASO (DUET-02)
On June 25, 2021, we, through our subsidiary Duet, entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “ASO Exclusive License Agreement”) with COH pursuant to which Duet acquired from COH an exclusive license to ASO Patent Rights, which include: (i) PCT Application, Serial No. PCT/US2016/040361, filed June 30, 2016; (ii) patents, patent applications, continuations, divisional applications, and foreign equivalents that claim the same invention(s) and priority date as the foregoing, such as United States Patent Number 10,758,624; (iii) continuation-in-part applications that repeat a substantial portion of any of the foregoing applications; (iv) letters patent or the equivalent issued on any of the foregoing applications throughout the world; and (v) amendments, extensions, renewals, reissues, supplementary protection certificates, substitutions and re-examinations of any of the foregoing. Subject to the terms and conditions of the ASO Exclusive License Agreement, COH granted us an exclusive royalty-bearing right and license to commercially exploit the licensed rights in the field of therapeutics.
In connection with the ASO Exclusive License Agreement, we agreed to pay COH an upfront one-time non-refundable license fee and an additional one-time non-refundable license fee no later than December 30, 2021. On or before the tenth business day after the beginning of each license year (excluding the first license year ending December 31, 2021), we agreed to pay to COH a non-refundable license maintenance fee. Over the course of the ASO Exclusive License Agreement, we are required to attain certain diligence milestones. Upon any change of control of Duet or an affiliate of Duet that controls Duet, we agreed to pay COH a non-refundable fee. We are also required to make development milestone payments for each indication. These development milestone payments are tied to achieving certain clinical milestones and obtaining marketing approvals. In addition to the development milestone payments, sales milestone payments are payable to COH tied to achieving certain levels of annual net sales. In addition, base royalties are payable on sales subject to minimum annual royalties, including an annual license maintenance fee.
Unless terminated earlier, the ASO Exclusive License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product (licensed service-by-licensed service) basis, until the parties’ royalty obligations end. The ASO Exclusive License Agreement is subject to termination upon certain events, including an uncured material breach by either party.
Exclusive License Agreement for CpG-STAT3decoy (DUET-03)
On June 25, 2021, we, through our subsidiary Duet, entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Decoy Exclusive License Agreement”) with COH pursuant to which we acquired from COH an exclusive license to Decoy Patent Rights, which include: (i) United States Issued Patent Number 9,976,147, issued May 22, 2018, United States Issued Patent Number 10,829,765, issued November 10, 2020, and United States Patent Application Number 17/070,321, filed October 14, 2020; (ii) patents, patent applications, continuations, divisional applications, and foreign equivalents that claim the same invention(s) and priority date as the foregoing; (iii) continuation-in-part applications that repeat a substantial portion of any of the foregoing applications; (iv) letters patent or the equivalent issued on any of the foregoing applications throughout the world; and (v) amendments, extensions, renewals, reissues, supplementary protection certificates, substitutions and re-examinations of any of the foregoing.
The remainder of the terms and conditions of the Decoy Exclusive License Agreement are substantially the same as the ASO Exclusive License Agreement, except that the deadline dates for the diligence milestones and the date and amount to reimburse COH for patent expenses are different. We refer to the siRNA Exclusive License Agreement, ASO Exclusive License Agreement and Decoy Exclusive License Agreements collectively as the “Duet License Agreements”.
Other Licenses and Arrangements
In addition to our licenses and other arrangements with COH, we have licenses and other arrangements for our non-immuno-oncology programs with the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (“Hebrew University”). These licenses cover additional drug candidates including drug candidates targeting SSc and other fibrotic conditions and opioid-sparing pain treatments. With respect to all of our programs, we continually evaluate them for feasibility and potential likelihood of success

generally and relative to the cost of development, time for enrollment and development, patent life and market exclusivity. As such, we may seek to accelerate programs or terminate programs based upon these analyses, our financial wherewithal, market dynamics and other factors.
We have a license from the NIH to two active patent families relating to a series of cannabinoid receptor mediating compounds, including MRI-1867, developed at an Institute of the NIH at which research on endocannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system are conducted. MRI-1867 is a rationally designed, orally available, dual-action, hybrid, small molecule that is an inverse agonist of the endocannabinoid system/cannabinoid receptor 1 (“CB1”), as well as an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (“iNOS”). Over activation of CB1 and iNOS has been implicated in the pathophysiology of SSc, which includes fibrosis of the skin, lung, kidney, heart, and the gastrointestinal tract. Our license enables us to use these cannabinoid receptor mediating compounds for the commercial development as a new therapeutic for the treatment of SSc and other skin fibrotic diseases. Our rights under our license with the NIH may overlap with rights which may have been granted to another company. We have been in communication with the NIH seeking clarification as to each company’s rights. We have also had, from time to time, discussions with such other company to explore possible collaborations. We have been unable to enter into any such arrangements. There can be no assurance that this uncertainty will not have an adverse effect on any development of MRI-1867. We have two licenses from Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, LTD. (“Yissum”) relating to cannabidiol (“CBD”) combinations with approved anesthetics and to synthesis of novel cannabinoid dual-action compounds and chemical derivatives. As a result of the company’s increased emphasis on its immuno-oncology programs and other considerations, we have been continuing to reduce allocations of resources to other programs. The company has engaged in discussions with third parties to enable further possible changes in commitment of resources for programs unrelated to the company’s core immuno-oncology development programs. The company may also seek to explore strategic alternatives for the exploitation of these technologies. We have been in discussions with Yissum about our licenses, as well as other possible licenses for different technologies. We intend to continue our strategic evaluation of the development of drug candidates relating to the endocannabinoid system.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. As of December 31, 2021, our intellectual property, pursuant to our licenses and other arrangements, includes 12 U.S. issued patents, 5 pending U.S. nonprovisional patent application, 1 pending international patent applications, over 5 foreign issued patents and over 5 pending foreign patent applications. The claims of these patents and patent applications are directed toward various aspects of our drug candidates and research programs. 
We rely upon our licensors to obtain patent protection in the United States and internationally for our licensed drug candidates and our discovery programs, and any other inventions to which we have rights under our license agreements, where available and when appropriate. To the extent we will be able to do so, our policy will be to work with our licensors to pursue, maintain our licensed patents and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We will also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection by collaborating with our licensors and trade secret protection of our current and future drug candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending any patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of pending patent applications our licensors file or with respect to any patent applications our licensors file in the future, nor can we be sure that any existing patents or any patents that may be granted in the future upon which we rely will be commercially useful in protecting our drug candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our licensed intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
Litigation, Proxy Contest, and Related Matters
The company is involved in litigation initiated by or against the Adverse Parties. The Adverse Parties are primarily Morris Laster and certain of his family members (“Laster”), Ashish P. Sanghrajka (“Sanghrajka”) and/or Paul Hopper (“Hopper”). Laster is a former officer and director of the company and Sanghrajka is a former officer of the company. Sanghrajka and Hopper are current members of the company’s Board.

In April 2021, Laster initiated the Delaware Litigation against the company in the Chancery Court with respect to ownership of 3,500,000 shares of the company’s common stock. Pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Chancery Court in the Delaware Litigation, the parties agreed to, among other things, an expedited timeline for resolving the Delaware Litigation with a trial intended to be held in December 2021. Such stipulation also provided for adjournments or postponements of the company’s 2021 Annual Meeting, such that the Annual Meeting would be held and the vote on the items of business to be considered at the Annual Meeting would take place during a specified time after a decision on the merits by the Chancery Court or a final settlement between the parties. Pursuant to additional proceedings in the Chancery Court, the company became subject to further expedition for document production. The company’s inability to meet such production deadlines, among other things, resulted in the company being sanctioned by the Chancery Court. Laster made several motions relating to such sanctions, including seeking to recover lawyers’ fees. Commencing in January 2022, the Chancery Court, by subsequent hearings and court orders, specified the categories and amounts of legal fees which would be reimbursable. The precise reimbursable amount is not yet finalized and remains subject to a court order, which we anticipate will be finalized in Q2 2022. In an attempt to mitigate the dispute, reduce the ongoing expenses and disruption of expedition, and limit exposure under sanctions, the company has taken steps in an effort to resolve the Delaware Litigation, including facilitating the transfer by the then-record owner to Laster of record ownership of the Disputed Shares and facilitating the delivery of an irrevocable proxy by the then-record owner to Laster to vote such shares. The Delaware Litigation remains in discovery with a trial date scheduled for early June 2022.
In July 2021, the company reported that it had terminated the employment of Sanghrajka in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement. The company also reported that the Audit Committee of the Board had conducted an internal review and, as a result of such review, the Executive Committee and Audit Committee requested the resignations of Sanghrajka and Hopper from the Board. In August 2021, Sanghrajka filed a lawsuit against the company and several other parties alleging, among other things, that he was wrongfully terminated by the company. The company believes Sanghrajka’s lawsuit is without merit. The company filed a lawsuit, subsequently withdrawn, against Sanghrajka and Hopper and an affiliate of Hopper alleging, among other things, fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty and contractual obligations owed to the company in connection with Hopper’s sale of Bioscience Oncology Pty Ltd (“Bioscience Oncology”) to the company, and for declaratory judgment that Sanghrajka and Hopper are not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. In response to the lawsuit filed by the company, counsel for Sanghrajka and Hopper sent a letter to the company demanding indemnification and advancement of expenses relating to the company’s lawsuit against them. In October 2021, the company received a letter from counsel in Australia for Hopper claiming, among other things, that the company made defamatory statements about Hopper in certain of its SEC filings, including in the filing disclosing the request for Hopper to resign. The company believes that Hopper’s claims are without merit.
On October 26, 2021, the Adverse Parties filed the Derivative Complaint, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against all of the other members of the company’s Board, excluding Sanghrajka and Hopper, and certain of their affiliates in the Chancery Court. The Derivative Complaint set forth various assertions and allegations against directors who serve on the Executive Committee (the “Executive Committee Directors”) and certain other directors (the “Independent Directors”). On November 12, 2021, the company filed a motion to dismiss the Derivative Complaint. On March 11, 2022, the Chancery Court dismissed the Derivative Complaint.
On December 16, 2021, HCFP/Capital Partners VIB LLC (“VIB”) filed a Motion to Intervene and attached its Complaint in Intervention, which alleges, among other things, that although Laster claims to have acquired 6,000,000 shares of our common stock in June 2017, Laster never owned or acquired those shares because he did not sign or agree to VIB’s operating agreement, which is the only way he could have obtained such shares. On January 3, 2022, the Executive Committee Directors filed a Verified Complaint pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General Corporation Law challenging the results of the Annual Meeting, on the basis that, among other things, (i)Laster improperly voted six million shares of the company’s common stock at the Annual Meeting because Laster does not own such shares over which Laster improperly and incorrectly claimed ownership, and (ii)Laster would have not succeeded at the Annual Meeting but for the fact he improperly voted such shares given that an overwhelming majority (of more than 90%) of unaffiliated stockholders’ votes were in favor of the incumbent directors. Litigation is highly unpredictable and the costs of litigation, including legal fees, costs and expenses, and the possible liabilities, including monetary damages, to which the company could become subject could be significant. Any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company. The company’s existing capital resources will not be sufficient to fully implement its business plan, including the development of its drug candidates, while also continuing to be subject to or pursuing ongoing litigation. The company will require additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Further, there can be no assurance that the absence of any additional financing, as necessary, will not have a material adverse effect on the company.

Commercialization
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We may build our own commercial infrastructure or utilize contract reimbursement specialists, sales people, medical education specialists, distribution or other collaboration arrangements and take other steps to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure at such time as we believe that one of our drug candidates is approaching marketing approval.
Competition
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, and drug delivery companies. These companies include Avidity Biosciences, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Flamingo Therapeutics, Indaptus Therapeutics, Kymera Therapeutics and Tvardi Therapeutics. Some or all of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we do, and greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing drug candidates, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for drug candidates. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for indications we pursue that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely-prescribed or accepted, more useful and less costly, and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. We also face competition from third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials and in identifying and acquiring or in-licensing new products and drug candidates.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for final manufacture. We intend to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for future pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize.
For our future drug candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers and researchers to provide the application program interface (“API”), and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA. We expect to continue to fund the development of drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Employees, Executives, Advisors and Human Capital Resources
Our team is comprised of 9 members, including employees, executive officers who provide services pursuant to a management services agreement, and key consultants, 5 of whom spend substantially all, or a significant portion of, their business time on company matters. Our senior management consists of the President and Chief Executive Officer of Duet, our Chairman and our Vice Chairman, who are advised and assisted by the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board.
Our management team is supported by additional personnel associated with entities that provide services to the company pursuant to our management services agreement. We also employ consultants in the ordinary course of business with expertise in various aspects of the drug development process. We believe the skills and experience of our team are essential to our business. We are currently seeking to add additional employees and key consultants and advisors.
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. Our employees are a significant asset and we aim to create an equitable, inclusive and empowering environment in which our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, expanding and retaining our workforce to support our current pipeline and future business goals. By focusing on employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our clinical trials, our pipeline, our platform technologies, business and operations, and also protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. Our efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and passionate workforce include providing competitive compensation and benefits packages and ensuring we listen to our employees.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, through the Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, process before they may be legally marketed in Europe. Our drug candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulation
NDA Approval Processes
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
●refusal to approve pending applications;
●withdrawal of an approval;
●imposition of a clinical hold;
●warning letters;
●product seizures;
●total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
●injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
●completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, or other applicable regulations;
●submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
●performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
●submission to the FDA of an NDA;
●satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
●FDA review and approval of the NDA.


12



Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it will enter the pre-clinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
●Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
●Phase 2. Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
●Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.

13



According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.

The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug in accordance with state law.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change.
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
For a botanical drug, the FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principal components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the utility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug.
Five-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a duplicate version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the 505(b)(1) applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

15



After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase — the time between IND submission and NDA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $500,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug’s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant’s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. We may apply for orphan drug designation for one or more of our drug candidates that we develop for diseases or conditions that satisfy the requirements for orphan drug designation. In such event, there can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any of our drug candidates that we may develop for the treatment of any orphan diseases.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or iPSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of a Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The iPSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the iPSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon iPSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.

16



A drug product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
Post-approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
●record-keeping requirements;
●reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
●providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
●drug sampling and distribution requirements;
●notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
●complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Similar to the United States, the marketing of medicinal products is subject to the granting of marketing authorizations by regulatory agencies. Also, as in the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.

Medicinal products require a marketing authorization before they may be placed on the market in the European Economic Area, or EEA, comprising the member states of the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. There are various application procedures available, depending on the type of product involved. The centralized procedure gives rise to marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EEA. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products that (1) are derived from specified biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005) indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, (3) are orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products). For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the CHMP agrees that (i) the medicine concerned contains a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005), (ii) the medicine is a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or (iii) if its authorization under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health.
For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (1) a national procedure, which results in a marketing authorization in a single EEA member state; (2) the decentralized procedure, in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EEA member states; and (3) the mutual recognition procedure, which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EEA member state, and in which the EEA member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EEA member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health.
Marketing authorization applications must usually include the results of clinical trials. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EEA must be conducted in accordance with EEA and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCP. Prior to commencing a clinical trial in a particular EEA member state, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee.
In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date.
Reimbursement
Sales of any product we successfully develop will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have been seeking to overturn at least portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess this legislation and alternative health care reform proposals. Any legal challenges to ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of ACA.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

Controlled Substances Regulation
Cannabis (other than hemp) is strictly controlled under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”) as a Schedule I substance. Schedule I substances by definition have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. Anyone wishing to conduct research on substances listed in Schedule I under the CSA must register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), and obtain DEA approval of the research proposal. For any product containing cannabis to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, cannabis must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. Scheduling determinations by the DEA are dependent on FDA approval of a substance or a specific formulation of a substance.
The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics.
For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
Individual U.S. states also establish and maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.

Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
