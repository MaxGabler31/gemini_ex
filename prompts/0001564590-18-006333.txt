Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 aTyr Pharma is a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and clinical development of innovative medicines using its knowledge of tRNA synthetase biology. We have discovered novel extracellular functions of proteins derived from a number of tRNA synthetase genes, a family of more than 20 genes that influence immune function, and other activities, in previously unknown ways. Built on more than a decade of foundational science on extracellular tRNA synthetase biology and its effect on immune responses, we have built a global intellectual property estate directed to all 20 human tRNA synthetases as well as our product candidates. 
 Today, we focus on the therapeutic translation of the Resokine pathway, comprised of extracellular proteins derived from the histidyl tRNA synthetase (HARS) gene family, which has fueled a pipeline of novel drug candidate programs addressing disease areas of high unmet medical need, including cancer and lung disease. The pipeline below reflects those programs from the Resokine pathway that we are currently advancing.
 Therapeutic Candidate Pipeline:
 
We embrace scientific transparency and commitment to research excellence as we chart drug targets from the Resokine family and other human tRNA synthetase genes that we hope will shape a better future of patient care. 
 Our intellectual property estate comprises of over 250 issued patents or allowed patent applications that are owned or exclusively licensed, including over 300 potential protein compositions derived from tRNA synthetase genes.
 Strategy
 Our mission is to translate our understanding of extracellular tRNA synthetase biology into novel first-in-class drug programs for conditions with unmet patient need. 
 Key elements of our strategy include the following:
 Elucidate the therapeutic potential of proteins derived from tRNA synthetase genes, based on our leadership position in this new biology. Pathways emanating from tRNA synthetase gene families may represent an entire class of new drug targets. We are committed to translating these groundbreaking areas of newly discovered biology to therapeutic applications.
 Build a diverse pipeline of biologics based on our understanding of extracellular tRNA synthetase biology.  We continue to deepen our expertise in production of biologic product candidates and develop programs with multiple therapeutic modalities. Our initial programs have focused on agonizing or antagonizing the Resokine pathway and we are currently advancing two programs with potential applicability in cancer, lung disease, and other immune-mediated diseases.
 Expand upon our knowledge and clinical experience with the Resokine pathway to address severe conditions characterized by immune imbalance. We seek to expand upon our knowledge and clinical experience with the Resokine pathway to address severe conditions characterized by immune imbalance. We believe that a protein therapeutic or antibody that modulates the threshold for T-cell activation without immunosuppression would have a unique and valuable competitive advantage across multiple disease settings.

Leverage our internal knowledge and exclusive worldwide rights to our product candidates to form meaningful collaborations to enhance our future development and commercial efforts. Our scientists are making discoveries internally and collaborating with academic research institutions to elucidate the potential functionality of extracellular proteins derived from human tRNA synthetase gene families. We aim to increase the breadth of these collaborations with both academic and industry partners to discover and develop drugs targeting additional pathways based on tRNA synthetase biology.
 Our Science – tRNA Synthetase Biology
 Extracellular tRNA synthetase biology represents a newly discovered set of potential physiological modulators and potential therapeutic intervention points.
 Role of Ancient tRNA Synthetase Genes
 tRNA synthetases were originally thought to only play a role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs to their respective amino acids. In 1999, Paul Schimmel, Ph.D. and colleagues discovered that a protein derived from one of the genes for tRNA synthetases could act as an extracellular modulator of angiogenesis. Since then we, and many other researchers, have verified that tRNA synthetase gene products have a number of additional functional roles which may be mediated extracellularly by multiple splice variants from tRNA synthetase genes. Those functional roles include modulation of the immune system.
 We are engaged in the discovery and development of innovative medicines using our knowledge of these newly discovered pathways in immunology effected by extracellular tRNA synthetases.
 The Resokine Pathway – Modulating the Immune System
 Overview of the Resokine Pathway
 Our scientists were the first to discover the Resokine pathway, an extracellular pathway dependent upon a novel activity of the HARS protein and splice variants encoded by its gene. 
 The gene for HARS gives rise to a number of splice variants, many of which have lost their catalytic activity, but which retain the N-terminal domain of 59 amino acids. This domain was appended to HARS during evolution of multicellular organisms and is not essential for protein synthetic activity (as in prokaryotic organisms) but is retained with high homology across mammalian species. Proteins derived from the HARS gene, both full-length and splice variants, are present in human circulation and appear to play a role in modulating immune responses. We refer to the extracellular HARS proteins as Resokine, to differentiate them from the intracellular enzyme involved in protein synthesis.
 The Resokine pathway is a prime example of a new discovery that may translate into new treatments. The importance of this newly-elucidated pathway is illustrated by the finding that antibodies to Resokine, generated in a rare human auto-immune condition, contribute to dysregulation of the immune system and disease.

Resokine is secreted from cells and circulates naturally in all individuals tested. The N-terminal domain (the immunomodulatory domain, or “iMod” domain) has structural similarity to a region of 4 alpha–helical bundle cytokines. Resokine has activity to modulate T-cell activation and importantly, the N-terminal iMod domain is conserved among all the characterized splice variants arising from the HARS gene. 
 5

First Demonstration of a Splice Variant of HARS as an Immuno-modulator
 We conducted in vivo screening of the N-terminal iMod domain, which can be produced from a natural splice variant from the HARS gene, in several animal models of disease. In an acute rodent model administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, or TNBS, lead to severe immune cell activity or inflammation resulting in the death of the study animals. Animals administered the iMod domain survived significantly longer than those given either the vehicle control phosphate buffer solution, or an approved drug control (Budesonide) (p<0.01), demonstrating the potential activity of the iMod domain as an immuno-modulator agent.
 
Mechanism of Action
 The Resokine pathway includes interactions with activated T-cells. Our scientists continue to elucidate the role of the Resokine pathway in affecting the level of activation of T-cells stimulated by CD3 and CD28. We believe our agonist programs harness the Resokine pathway and interact with T-cells to temper T-cell activation. In addition, we believe our antagonist program blocks this pathway thereby lowering the threshold for T-cell activation. 
 To test in vitro effects of Resokine on T cell activation, Resokine was tested by addition to T-cells undergoing activation in vitro with antibodies to CD3 and CD28. Resokine was able to significantly inhibit T-cell activation in these in vitro assays, as evidenced by a reduction of various cytokines, such as IL-2 and granzyme B, known to be markers related to T-cell activity.

In vitro T-cell modulation experiments have demonstrated that at concentrations greater than 30 pM Resokine results in significant reduction of T-cell activation as shown by reduced expression of T-cell activation markers. Resokine appears to work to inhibit T-cell activation such that T-cells require enhanced stimulation to overcome the inhibitory effect.
 
6

Evidence of the Role of the Resokine Pathway in Patients
 In 1983, Matthews and Bernstein published in Nature the observation that patients with a rare myopathy possessed antibodies to a single tRNA synthetase, HARS. Since then, it has been observed that patients with auto-antibodies to HARS can develop a debilitating myopathy as well as severe interstitial lung disease, both of which are characterized by T-cell invasion into diseased tissues. Numerous research laboratories have verified the existence of human anti-HARS antibodies, also known as Jo-1 antibodies, as one of the manifestations of the most common form of anti-synthetase syndrome.
 Based on these observations, we chose to study the potential link between HARS antibodies and anti-synthetase syndrome patients with Jo-1 antibodies. Our scientists obtained serum samples from 18 of these patients to determine whether the Jo-1 antibodies specifically bound to the iMod domain. We determined that in each of the 18 Jo-1 antibody positive patients studied, a significant portion of Jo-1 antibody binding was to the iMod domain, compared to binding to other regions of HARS. 
 We believe that in these patients, the binding of Jo-1 antibodies to the iMod domain blocked the immuno-modulatory properties of the iMod domain, therefore contributing to their myopathy and interstitial lung disease. Independent laboratories have also observed in unrelated studies that the iMod domain is the primary antibody binding region in Jo-1 antibody patients with anti-synthetase syndrome.
 Translation into Therapeutic Applications
 We believe therapies that can harness the power of the immune system represent an important frontier of transformational medicines. All of our current programs focus on modulating the immune system in an effort to create better clinical outcomes for patients. Our preclinical work increases our confidence that Resokine may be used to modulate immune cell activity, especially in diseases wherein the pathophysiology of the disease may be driven by excessive T-cell activation. Our early clinical work increases our confidence that these proteins will continue to demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no observed signs of general immunosuppression as we progress into later stage clinical trials.
Product Development Programs 
 Immuno-oncology
 Overview of the ORCA Program
 ORCA is a preclinical research program that targets the Resokine pathway using antibodies to bind to Resokine in tumor settings. We believe tumors, across multiple tumor types, may utilize Resokine to aid in the evasion of host anti-tumor immune responses.  We have evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting this novel pathway in multiple in vitro and in vivo tumor models, in comparison to and in combination with incumbent check-point modulators. Based on the tumor model data, we believe that targeting this pathway can reduce or, in some cases, reverse tumor growth either as a monotherapy or in combination therapy.  ORCA represents a novel and proprietary target to block the Resokine pathway that we believe is active across multiple tumor types. Resokine is elevated across 100% of the tumor types tested and active in 95% or more of patients with a specific tumor type (15 types tested across over 450 patients).
 In December 2017, we selected a panel of antibodies for continued preclinical development and initiated Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) activities for our ORCA program. 
 Extracellular Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase Gene Proteins With Immune Modulation Activity
 We refer to the extracellular proteins derived from the HARS gene as Resokine. Both the full-length and splice variants of Resokine are present in human circulation and play a role in modulating immune responses. Resokine proteins, all of which contain the N-terminal iMod domain, appear to have activity modulating T cell activity. We have conducted experiments to measure that the levels of iMod domain proteins are elevated in cancer, both in human plasma and in syngeneic tumor models in mice. In addition, monoclonal antibodies to the iMod domain appear to inhibit tumor growth in mice.
 The N-terminal iMod domain is conserved among all the characterized splice variants arising from the HARS gene, and thus constitutes a potential epitope that can be targeted by antibodies to neutralize all forms of Resokine.
 In combination with our knowledge of the agonist to the Resokine pathway and the experiments we have performed we believe these results demonstrate that Resokine has immunomodulatory activity in vitro through reduction in the extent of T cell activation. This activity appears to be dependent on the iMod domain because the recombinant iMod domain alone, or fused to immunoglobulin Fc (ATYR1923), has equivalent activity in these assays (data not shown). Resokine circulates naturally in all individuals tested, and appears to have immuno-modulatory activity, therefore we propose that Resokine may act as an “immune set-point” controlling the extent of T cell activation achieved with a given stimulus.
 7

Resokine Levels are Elevated in Cancer 
 Resokine levels were measured from mouse or human samples using specific immunoassays with two non-competing antibodies to Resokine. Assays were carried out on the Meso Scale Discovery platform and verified using multiple formats. 
 
In the experiments we conducted, we observed that Resokine appears to be released from cancer cell lines in culture. Levels vary from cell line to cell line. 
 Resokine levels in serum were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice as compared to normal mice. Resokine levels are increased in proportion to tumor growth, with levels increasing over 10-fold in very large B16F10 tumors.

Human plasma samples from patients with tumors show a higher mean level of Resokine than normal healthy volunteers, and notably few patient samples have levels of Resokine below 30pM, a level with functional activity in vitro. Extended data sets show this pattern appears to be retained across multiple tumor types.
 Resokine levels in healthy volunteers (n = 148) ranged from 8pM to > 2333pM with 18% of the individuals at a level below 30pM. In contrast, levels measured across patients (n = 466) with all tumor types tested ranged from 20pM to > 2333pM (above the upper limit of quantification) with only 4% of the patients at low levels, defined as < 30pM; (p < 0.0001).
 8

We believe that Resokine secretion may be used by tumors as an additional mechanism to down-regulate anti-tumor immune responses. Since the levels of circulating Resokine are sufficient to modulate T cell activity, based on our in vitro experiments, we hypothesize that the enhanced release of Resokine from tumor cells may further increase the threshold stimulation required to generate an active immune response. There is the potential for this to be an additional mechanism by which tumor cells may evade immune responses.
 Anti-Resokine Antibodies Have Anti-tumor Activity
 We have evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting this novel pathway in multiple in vivo tumor models, in comparison to and in combination with incumbent check-point modulators.  Based on the tumor model data, we believe that targeting this pathway may reduce or, in some cases, reverse tumor growth either as a monotherapy or in combination therapy.
 
Anti-tumor activity was initially tested in the B16F10 syngeneic tumor model in C57Bl6 mice. B16F10 tumor cells (1x104 cells in 0.1mL PBS/20% matrigel) were implanted subcutaneously on the right flank on day 0. Antibody therapy was administered by intraperitoneal injection on days -1, 6, and 13 (200 microgram/antibody/mouse). Tumor volumes were measured at indicated intervals over 21 days. Statistics are 1-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s.
 Immune-mediated Diseases
 Overview of ATYR1923 (iMod.Fc Program)
 We established the iMod.Fc program to leverage our knowledge of the Resokine pathway to vary exposure and activity of the iMod domain through protein engineering. The goal of the program was to develop a potential therapeutic which would possess only the N-terminal immuno-modulatory activities of Resokine and fuse it to the FC region of a human antibody.
9


Our Fc fusion experiments helped delineate how to increase the serum half-life and enhance the exposure of the iMod domain of Resokine while maintaining activity and provide insights into this domain harboring immuno-modulatory activity. Experiments have indicated that Fc fusion proteins can be generated which increase exposure and maintain iMod domain activity. 
 Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) and the Role of Immunology
 ILD develops in approximately 85% of Jo-1 positive anti-synthetase patients with antibodies to Resokine. It can include the presence of focal immune cell infiltrates and an acinar pattern of involvement on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, lymphocytic predominance on broncho-alveolar lavage and lymphocytic invasion of alveolar and interstitial lung tissues on biopsy, and can advance to fibrosis. The pathological patterns in Jo-1 antibody ILD include cellular and fibrotic forms of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar damage. The development of ILD in Jo-1 antibody patients, particularly the acute severe forms of the disease, portends high morbidity and mortality. Elevations in a number of circulating immune proteins are observed in Jo-1 antibody associated ILD including interferon (IFN)-inducible chemokines CXCL9, or MIG, and CXCL10 or IP-10, IL-8 and IL-6.
 Among the various forms of ILD, we have identified several that result in severe and progressive lung disease and share immune-pathophysiology features that have the potential to be impacted by our demonstrated ATYR1923 preclinical activities. Examples of pulmonary diseases with an immune component include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, sarcoidosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and ILD in the setting of systemic sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis.
 Preclinical Development
 To test our hypothesis that augmenting the Resokine pathway with ATYR1923 has therapeutic potential in ILD, we have generated data in a mouse model of lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. ATYR1923 has also shown promising therapeutic activity in this bleomycin-induced model (as set forth in the figure below) which has been used as translational rationale previously in the development of therapeutics for different forms of ILD, including the drug pirfenidone, or Esbriet®, which was approved by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

PO = oral dosing; IV = intravenous dosing; BLM = Bleomycin; Dex = Dexamethasone
 ATYR1923 administered therapeutically drives activity comparable to or greater than Pirfenidone, anti-TGF antibodies, and dexamethasone. 
 Experiment 1: Lung tissues collected on Day 21 (i.e., after 2 weeks of protein treatment) were stained with Masson’s Trichrome stain. Ashcroft scores were assigned to 8-10 fields per animal; all analyzed fields are represented. Bleomycin induced an increase in histological fibrosis. ATYR1923 (0.4 mg/kg once weekly) significantly ameliorated fibrosis as measured by histological Ashcroft scoring. TGFβ blockade and pirfenidone did not have significant effects on fibrosis in this experiment (*p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001 vs. Vehicle IV, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test).
 Experiment 2: Lung tissues collected on Day 21 (i.e., after 2 weeks of protein treatment) were stained with Masson’s Trichrome stain. Ashcroft scores were assigned to 20 fields per animal; all analyzed fields are represented. Bleomycin induced an increase in histological fibrosis. ATYR1923 (0.4 mg/kg once weekly) significantly ameliorated fibrosis as measured by histological Ashcroft scoring (***p < 0.001 vs. Respective Vehicle, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test).
 These preclinical experiments were presented in a poster at the American Thoracic Society International Congress in Washington D.C. in May 2017. 
 Clinical Development Plan
 We are conducting a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of ATYR1923. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ATYR1923 in healthy volunteers. The study will enroll 36 subjects into one of six sequential cohorts and subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive a single infusion of ATYR1923 or placebo. Ascending ATYR1923 doses by cohort range from 0.03 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg.
 We anticipate learning more about the safety profile and tolerability of ATYR1923 as well as some characteristics of its pharmacokinetics and dosing potential. In parallel, we are expanding our knowledge of the therapeutic potential of ATYR1923 by conducting several in vivo and in vitro models to further elucidate its potential clinical utility. These data, as well as the Phase 1 clinical trial results, will help inform selection of the indication for future clinical trials for our ATYR1923 program.Overview of ATYR1940 (Resolaris)
 We internally discovered and developed ATYR1940, our first therapeutic candidate based on a protein naturally secreted from muscle (Resokine) that may act to influence T-cell activation at the tissue level to promote healthier muscle. There is potential that ATYR1940 may translate into an innovative therapeutic for rare genetic myopathies with an immune component, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  We collected evidence that supports applicability of ATYR1940 as an example of adding back a protein that is insufficiently produced by the human body to potentially counteract disease.
 11

Current Status 
 At this time, we are not pursuing additional clinical development of ATYR1940 without a significant collaboration or strategic partnership. This decision is based on prioritizing the other programs in the pipeline, which we feel have an opportunity to add significant value and support translation of our science into the clinic in a more capital efficient manner.
Safety and Tolerability Profile
 ATYR1940 is a slightly truncated version of the full Resokine protein. As such, the early clinical safety and tolerability data has high utility for all our Resokine pathway based programs. 
 Our early clinical development for ATYR1940 evaluated three rare genetic myopathies: adult FSHD, early onset FSHD, and LGMD2B where there is no therapeutic standard of care currently available. This allowed us to collect important information related to the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of our first product candidate in the clinic. Establishing a safety dossier in our Phase 1b/2 trials in treatment naïve patients was an important developmental milestone for us to achieve for all our programs related to the Resokine pathway.
 To date, 44 patients have received ATYR1940 across three 3-month clinical trials with two extension studies for a total drug exposure of 204 patient months. In those trials, ATYR1940 was well tolerated in all doses tested, across various age groups, and with long-term exposure. No serious adverse events were reported by the study investigators. A low incidence of adverse events was reported in these trials and all adverse events were mild-to-moderate in intensity. There were no observed signs of general immunosuppressive effects which is consistent with a homeostatic pathway working at the tissue level.
 A low level of anti-drug antibody assay signals was observed in these trials. These signals did not reach levels to trigger a neutralizing assay and did not result in clinical symptoms. Protocol discontinuations in these studies were primarily driven by mild-to-moderate transient infusion related reactions and elevations in a sponsor defined Jo-1 antibody level threshold.
 Our Discovery Engine for Therapeutic Applications of tRNA Synthetase Biology
 We plan to leverage our discovery engine to identify other tRNA synthetase pathways of interest and select additional product candidates for preclinical and clinical investigation in a variety of disease settings through a combination of efforts between ourselves, Pangu Biopharma Ltd., our subsidiary, and the Scripps Research Institute.
 We believe our strategy of understanding extracellular tRNA synthetase function by using in vivo experiments early and often while using patient data to focus this in vivo exploration has been validated by our early-stage clinical programs. Additionally, we believe our discovery engine can be applied to other members of the tRNA synthetase family to help identify additional clinical utility.
 We believe this new biology presents novel protein therapeutic development opportunities based on the modulation of important immunological pathways applicable to multiple diseases. In addition to our own internal development work, we will work with collaborators and academia to further understand the potential clinical utility and mechanism of tRNA synthetase biology.
 Collaborations

 Pangu Biopharma
 In October 2007, we formed our Hong Kong subsidiary, Pangu BioPharma Limited, or Pangu BioPharma, a company registered in Hong Kong, to collaborate with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, or HKUST, on the discovery and development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. We hold 98% of the outstanding shares of Pangu BioPharma, and a subsidiary of HKUST holds the remaining outstanding shares. Beginning in July 2008, Pangu BioPharma, in collaboration with HKUST, entered into a series of three research grant agreements with the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to carry out research in the discovery and development of tRNA synthetase biology. In December 2017, Pangu BioPharma renewed its annual joint research agreement with a subsidiary of HKUST, under which Pangu BioPharma agrees to fund research to be performed in 2018 under the agreement by the subsidiary of HKUST with respect to development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. Pangu BioPharma is the sole beneficial owner of all resulting intellectual property rights from the research performed under these agreements, subject to the right of HKUST’s subsidiary to use certain background intellectual property of HKUST in conducting the research and, in the event Pangu BioPharma applies for individual funding of any work under the research programs, compliance with the terms and conditions of any written agreement covering ownership of such funded works. Pangu BioPharma funds the annual research on a quarterly basis. Either party may terminate the agreement during the annual period upon an uncured breach of the agreement by the other party. We are also party to a license agreement with Pangu BioPharma, pursuant to which Pangu BioPharma has granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license (with a right to sublicense) in and to certain of Pangu BioPharma’s solely and jointly owned patent rights and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use, import, export, distribute, offer for sale, sell and have sold products incorporating such patent rights and know-how for any therapeutic, prognostic or diagnostic use throughout the world.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We will face competition with respect to our product candidates and any other therapeutics we may develop or commercialize in the future, from pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and established marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop.
 Although we believe we are the only company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics based on novel functions of tRNA synthetases we are aware of other companies that are developing products that could compete as treatments for our targeted indications, as described below.
 13

ORCA Program
 There are a number of companies engaged in the development of immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat various oncology indications across a range of tumor types. While we are not aware of any other companies developing antibodies to Resokine as a target for immunotherapy, the immuno-oncology field is competitive, with treatments currently approved and on the market or in development with various mechanisms of action, targeting various tumor types and patient populations from a variety of different companies including Merck & Co., Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Merck KGaA, all of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Our program, if successful, will likely face significant competition both by therapeutics that are already being marketed as well as those that will be approved for marketing before our program.
 ATYR1923
 We are aware of three FDA approved products with indications for the treatment of specific forms of ILD. Esbriet® (pirfenidone), marketed globally by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Shionogi Ltd. and Il Dong Pharmaceutical, and Ofev® (nintedanib), a small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor marketed globally by Boehringer Ingelheim, both were approved in October 2014 to treat Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). H.P. Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection) is marketed globally by Mallinckrodt plc for a number of indications, including symptomatic sarcoidosis. There are a number of companies engaged in the clinical development of potential new therapeutics for various forms of ILD, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, FibroGen, Inc., Galapagos NV, Kadmon Holdings, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, and Roche.
 ATYR1940
 There are currently no FDA approved therapeutics for the treatment of FSHD or LGMD2B. Acceleron Pharma, Inc. is developing a clinical candidate, ACE-083, a locally acting protein therapeutic designed to increase muscle mass and strength in patients with neuromuscular disorders and other diseases characterized by a loss of muscle function, including FSHD in which it initiated a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2016. Myonexus is developing MYO-201 for the treatment of LGMD2B. This gene therapy approach is currently in a FDA-required intramuscular Phase 1 study to assess safety.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We intend, where strategically appropriate, to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States and Europe necessary to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in a particular geographic market appears imminent. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products in selected geographic locations or for particular indications.
 Additional capabilities important to the marketing of therapeutics include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing or testing facilities for the clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, and contract research organizations, or CROS, is cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional resources early in development. Although we rely on CDMOs and CROs, we have personnel with extensive biologics development and manufacturing experience to oversee such CDMOs and CROs.
 To date, our CDMOs and CROs have met our manufacturing requirements for clinical development and we expect that our current CDMOs and CROs are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our anticipated clinical development needs.
 ORCA Program
 ORCA is a preclinical immuno-oncology research program that targets the Resokine pathway using antibodies to bind to Resokine in tumor settings. We are currently in early stages of CMC activities, including cell line development contracted at a CRO and have selected a CDMO for GMP manufacturing.

ATYR1923
 ATYR1923 is a Fc fusion molecule that is expressed in recombinant E.coli by expression in inclusion bodies and refolding to recreate the native structure. We have worked with CDMOs in the United States on the development and GMP manufacturing process for the successful production of ATYR1923 preclinical and clinical drug substance and drug product for initial Phase 1/2 studies. We contract with CROs to conduct labeling, storage and distribution of ATYR1923 to clinical sites.
 ATYR1940
 ATYR1940 is expressed in recombinant E.coli, purified, formulated, filled and packaged for clinical use. For our Phase 1b/2 clinical trials conducted to date, the drug substance for ATYR1940 was manufactured by a CDMO in India. ATYR1940 drug product for such Phase 1b/2 clinical trials was manufactured by CDMOs in India and the United States.
 We are working with a CDMO in the United States, and have completed the development, scale-up and GMP manufacturing process for the production of ATYR1940 drug substance to meet the needs of any future clinical development. We have also successfully demonstrated comparability of the product manufactured with the different process and scales and at different sites. The drug product process for ATYR1940 was also successfully scaled and transferred to a CDMO in Germany. We contract with CROs to conduct labeling, as well as for the storage and distribution of ATYR1940 drug product to clinical sites.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We own, or have exclusive licenses to, over 175 issued patents or allowed patent applications with predicted expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2034. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of extracellular tRNA synthetase biology.
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to new methods of treatment, therapeutics and additional new product forms thereof with new therapeutic or pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering our protein therapeutics, next generation product forms and the use of these compositions in a variety of therapies.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in us incurring substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.

The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
 ORCA Program 
 Our ORCA patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent families related to antibodies to novel epitopes and specific HARS splice variants, methods of use claims for the treatment of cancer, vaccines and methods of vaccination, and therapeutic compositions to human and humanized antibodies to HARS. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases as international applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, or in some cases as continuations of existing previously filed cases. If issued, these patents are predicted to expire between 2030 and 2037, absent any patent term extensions.
 ATYR1923
Our ATYR1923 patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent families related to derivatives of Resokine, including the iMod domain, related splice variants, combinations with other therapeutics, and next-generation product forms with modified therapeutic activity or pharmacokinetic characteristics. As of February 8, 2018, our ATYR1923 patent portfolio includes a patent family that is jointly owned by us and our 98% owned subsidiary, Pangu Biopharma, and includes three issued U.S. patents, two patents issued in Japan, and one in each of Europe, China, and Australia, and patent applications pending in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. The U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2030 and 2031, absent any patent term extension for regulatory delays, and the ex-U.S. patents, and patents that issue from these patent applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030, absent any patent term extension. The ATYR1923 patent portfolio also includes another patent family jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma, which includes patent applications directed to related splice variants of HARS. This patent family includes two issued US Patents, and one patent issued in each of Europe, Japan, China, Australia, and New Zealand. Patent applications are pending in the United States, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and Hong Kong. Patents that issue from these patent applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2031, absent any patent term extension. Also included within the ATYR1923 patent portfolio are pending patent applications directed to specific product forms of ATYR1923, ATYR1940, and other HARS splice variants, and patent families directed to Fc fusion proteins, and combinations for treating lung inflammation. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases as international applications under the PCT. If issued, these patents are predicted to expire between 2033 and 2038, absent any patent term extensions.
 ATYR1940
  Our ATYR1940 patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent families directed to ATYR1940 and related proteins. As of Feburary 8, 2018 our ATYR1940 patent portfolio includes a patent family that is jointly owned by us and our 98% owned subsidiary, Pangu Biopharma, and includes two issued U.S. patents, and one patent issued in each of Australia, Europe, Japan, and South Africa and New Zealand and patent applications pending in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and Russia. The U.S. patents and patents that issue from these patent applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2033, absent any patent term extension for regulatory delays. Our ATYR1940 patent portfolio also includes a second patent family that is wholly owned by us and that includes patents and pending patent applications that are directed to ATYR1940 and related proteins. This second patent family includes three issued U.S. patents and patents issued in Europe, Japan, China, and Australia, and Hong Kong as well as related patent applications that are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, and Japan. The U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2030 and 2031, absent any patent term extension for regulatory delays, and the ex-U.S. patents, and patents that issue from these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030, absent any patent term extension. Also included with the ATYR1940 patent portfolio are pending patent applications directed to specific methods of use of ATYR1940 and related proteins and disease polymorphisms of HARS. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases under the PCT. U.S. provisional applications may be used to establish non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. PCT applications are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. Patents that issued from these applications, if any, are predicted to expire between 2033 and 2037, absent any patent term extensions.
 Our pipeline of extracellular tRNA synthetase proteins is covered by a series of 21 patent families, which are directed to all 20 human cytosolic tRNA synthetases. At least 42 patents are issued in the United States, including patents directed to specific therapeutic protein compositions, the corresponding protein polynucleotide sequences, and applications directed to antibody compositions to specific splice variants.  These cases are jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma, and include pending applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, Europe, China and Japan. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2031. Additional patent applications have also been separately filed on GARS (Glycyl-tRNA synthetase), DARS (Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase), and other tRNA synthetases, and any patents issuing from these patent applications would be expected to expire between 2026 and 2030. We have also exclusively in-licensed from TSRI, patents and patent applications related to YARS and specific monomeric forms of tRNA synthetases.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing the non-provisional patent application from which the patent issued.
 In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of pharmaceutical and biological products, such as those we are developing. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, or a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA or NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans in clinical trials. The IND submission includes the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA or NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 18

Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials.
 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances.  Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug. Submission of a BLA or NDA to the FDA.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs and NDAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA or NDA is also subject to an annual prescription drug product program fee. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA and NDA user fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.
 A BLA or NDA for a new molecular entity must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on a BLA or NDA
 The FDA evaluates a BLA to determine whether the data demonstrate that the biologic is safe, pure, and potent, or effective, and an NDA to determine whether the drug is safe and effective.  After the FDA evaluates the BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial. The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 19

Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of BLAs and NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA during development and testing, the eligibility for priority review, and rolling review, which is submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant the BLA or NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA or NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing trials or completion of ongoing trials after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims or some changes to the manufacturing process, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. 
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing, or result in the imposition of post-market studies or trials to assess new safety risks.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 20

Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended, BLAs and NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.  The requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA or NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. 
 Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 There is an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 
 21

The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA or NDA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.
 Countries that are part of the European Union, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of pharmaceutical and biologic products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Authorization Procedures in the European Union
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
  
• | Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.

• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults.
 New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which a generic application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan medicinal product designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the European Union, orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
 Orphan medicinal product designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval
 Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for European Union approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances may be applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization may be applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.
 23

Accelerated Review
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third- party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”  The BBA also extended the coverage gap discount program to include biosimilars starting in 2019.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device exercise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to modify, repeal, or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, any law replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal or replacement on our business remains unclear.  Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 24

In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the provision of the Affordable Care Act referred to as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests of physicians and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 25

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Employees 
 As of March 15, 2018 we had 65 full-time and part-time employees.  None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
