ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
GBT Technologies Inc. (formally known as Gopher Protocol Inc., the “Company”, “GBT”, “Gopher”, “Gopher Protocol” “GOPH” or “GTCH”) was incorporated on July 22, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada. GBT is targeting growing markets such as development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking and tracking technologies, including wireless mesh network technology platform and fixed solutions, development of an intelligent human body vitals device, asset-tracking IoT, and wireless mesh networks. Effective August 5, 2019, the Company changed its name from Gopher Protocol Inc. to GBT Technologies Inc. The Company derived revenues from the provision of IT consulting services. The Company is seeking to generate revenue from the licensing of its technology and/or revenue sharing.
 
Asset tracking IoT - and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking (including AI Medical Advisor platform and potential products)
 
The Company plans to launch a series of software and microchip design products that integrate into strategic technology partners’ solutions and enable real-time tracking and management of IoT or connected assets.
 
Through the Joint Venture with Tokenize – It S.A., the parties commenced development of a development of an intelligent human vital signs’ device, suggested named qTerm. The platform is an expansion of the existing license agreement with GBT Tokenize Corp., which provided GBT Tokenize Corp. with an exclusive territory of California to develop certain of the Company’s technology. A provisional patent application for the qTerm Medical Device was filed on March 30, 2020 with the USPTO. The application has been assigned serial number 63001564, which was followed by a none provisional patent application – published by the USPTO on September 30, 2021 publication number US 2021/02986000 A1. The Joint Venture completed successfully the first prototype. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in researching, developing or implementing this product into the market. In order to successfully implement this concept, the Company will need to raise adequate capital to support its research and, if successfully researched, developed and granted regulatory approval, the Company would need to enter into a strategic relationship with a third party that has experience in manufacturing, selling and distributing this product. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in any or all of these critical steps.
 
Asset tracking IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking (including AI Medical Advisor platform and potential products) competition
 
The prevailing AI solutions in the marketplace currently are a combination of barcoding and RFID technologies. Existing solutions require that the asset is near the scanner to be scanned. Further, such existing solutions are “point to point,” meaning they require repeated scan points along a route in order to update the location of the asset. The Company’s asset tracking solutions are designed to be more accurate and when placed on or into the asset, has the ability to interactively locate and update information on an asset anywhere on Earth. Its solutions work through-enabled global mesh network and does not need GPS or GSM to locate the package. In addition, the Company’s solutions are planned to include resource and distributed database management features which are not normally found in IoT systems. There are many competitors supplying AI standalone, and AI asset tracking and asset tracking IoT systems today, including companies such as AT&T, IBM and Verizon, as well as Apple which introduce tracking device during 2021. It is Company’s goal to offer the GopherInsight platform to some or all of these competitors to upgrade and differentiate their solutions.

Wireless mesh networking
 
Wireless mesh networks consist of LAN/MAN/WAN solutions that are infrastructural-intensive, may rely on regulated frequencies and bandwidth, often have so-called “last mile” problems areas where either economics or population density make it too expensive for current solutions to cover, and difficult to manage centrally. The Company’s GopherInsight platform makes it easy to add and manage last mile capacity. The solution is easily integrated into existing networks. The Company’s AI platform is designed for easy integration with, and management of, additional coverage for customer networks.
 
Wireless mesh networking markets
 
The Company potentially will target telecommunications providers, corporate entities that run LAN or wide-area networks, universities, and government entities.
 
Wireless mesh networking markets competition
 
The competitors for wireless mesh networking solutions, and AI solutions, are the entities themselves that have their own capability. The Company’s strategy is to integrate and “wrap around” those solutions to make them more efficient, less costly, and less infrastructural-intensive, while at the same time solving last mile problems to the end user.
 
Prepaid services (completely disposed of in 2020)
 
On September 1, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with a third party, RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, a Georgia corporation. The Company entered into this Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire terminals in approximately 9,400 locations by which, and at which, the Company planned to deploy its IoT/asset tracking technology. The operations consist primarily of the sale of phones and phone card products, including PINS for cell minutes, SIM cards for cell minutes, as well as gift cards and prepaid long-distance cards. The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, UGopherServices Corp. (“UGopherServices”), to operate the acquired assets. The assets acquired in the purchase consisted of racks that contain 9-12 items per rack that are displayed in retail locations, mainly convenience stores; and payment terminals at those same points of sale.
 
On March 16, 2018, the Company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement dated March 1, 2018 with ECS Prepaid, LLC (“ECS”), a Missouri limited liability company, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets from ECS, including, but not limited to, the processing prepaid platform, servers, POS terminals, customer list, a processing software program and goodwill, in consideration of $1,100,000 of which $100,000 was paid on the Closing Date and the balance is to be paid pursuant to a secured promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000. In addition, the Company issued 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock that are exercisable for a period of five years at a fixed exercise price of $1.85 per share. The note is secured by the assets acquired by the Company from ECS and the Company is required to make ten equal principal payments of $100,000 commencing on April 15, 2018. The Company may prepay the note at any time without penalty.
 
On April 2, 2018, the Company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement with Electronic Check Services, Inc. (“Electronic Check”), a Missouri corporation, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets from Electronic Check, including, but not limited to, assets associated with software that validates written check authenticity. The purchase price was $75,000 in cash, and the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock that are exercisable for a period of five years at a fixed exercise price of $2.70 per share.
 
On April 2, 2018, the Company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement with Central State Legal Services, Inc. (“CSLS”), a Missouri corporation, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets from CSLS, including, but not limited to, assets associated with a system to recover funds from returned checks, for $25,000 in cash.
 
The Company entered into these asset purchase agreements to acquire the software needed to process transactions for its prepaid business, and to acquire additional terminal locations by which the Company will deploy its technology. On a combined basis, there are approximately 9,400 points of sale as a result of acquiring certain assets from both RWJ Advanced Marketing LLC and ECS.
 
On or around November 10, 2017, UGopherServices experienced a suspension of operations on the terminals that the Company acquired in its acquisition on September 1, 2017 from RWJ Advanced Marketing LLC. Management of the Company believes that this shutdown came as a result of the decision of Paypal Holdings Inc. (“Paypal”) decision to suspend operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”), and appears to have affected all of TIO’s customers. TIO was acquired by Paypal in or around July 2017. Prior to the suspension, the Company received no notice from TIO, or from RWJ Advanced Marketing LLC, which sold the assets to UGopherServices, that the suspension would be taking place. Although the Company worked diligently to contain the fallout from the suspension of operations by TIO, the vast majority of the customers that were acquired as part of the transaction defected as a result. The subsequent acquisition of ECS was done partly to stem the customer defections, as many of the customers of UgopherServices sought the services of ECS. In doing so, the Company got many, though not all, of the customers back.
 
The Company is currently in litigation with RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, its executives and other third parties, and wrote off a substantial portion of its investment in UgopherServices from September 1, 2017. The Company’s position is that it was defrauded by the Seller and certain third parties due to the lack of disclosure of TIO’s decision to suspend operations.

There is no material relationship between the Company, on one hand, and MLH, on the other hand.
 
On March 8, 2020, SURG filed a lawsuit against its transfer agent, Vstock with respect to the transfer SURG common stock that is currently in possession of the Company and assigned to Stanley Hills, LLC. On January 1, 2021, SURG, AltCorp and Stanley Hills, LLC (“Stanley”) entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, SURG agreed to amend the AltCorp Exchange Agreement where SURG acknowledged a debt of $3,300,000 (the “Debt”) to be paid in 33 monthly payments of $100,000 payable in shares of common stock of SURG at a per share price equal the volume weighted average price of Surg’s common stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the issuance. The Company paid $650,000 in cash and the remaining by shares. The SURG common stock issued to Altcorp have been pledged since August 12, 2020 for the benefit of Stanley to secure Stanley’s note payable by the Company. Accordingly, the SURG Common Stock issued to AltCorp as a result of the Settlement Agreement were pledged to Stanley. As of December 31, 2021 there were no surge shares pledges after the final settlement signed on December 22, 2021 and that replaced all prior settlement agreement. The final settlement SURG agreed to make total payments of $4,200,000 to the Company on or prior to January 7, 2022. This $4.2 million amount consists of $450,000 paid by SURG in November and December 2021, $100,000 to be paid on or about January 4, 2022, and $3,650,000 to be paid on or prior to January 7, 2022 of which $375,000 will be held in escrow as described before.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded an outstanding payable balance to Stanley amounted $1,862,928 recorded under accrued expenses.
 
Subsequently, SURG was a party to two lawsuits in, the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, Nevada involving AltCorp, Stanley and Glen Eagles Acquisition LP (the “AltCorp Parties.”). Each of these lawsuits were ultimately disputes relating to the total consideration SURG was to pay the Company under the APA.
 
On October 18, 2021, the AltCorp Parties, the Company, and SURG entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) to set up a framework for an attempt to settle the two lawsuits.

GBT Technologies, S.A. (“GBT”) (fully impaired in 2019)
 
On June 17, 2019, the Company, AltCorp Trading LLC, a Costa Rica company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“AltCorp”), GBT Technologies, S.A., a Costa Rica company (“GBT-CR”) and Pablo Gonzalez, a shareholder’s representative of GBT-CR (“Gonzalez”), entered into and closed an Exchange Agreement (the “GBT Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties exchanged certain securities. In accordance with the Exchange Agreement, AltCorp acquired 625,000 shares of GBT-CR representing 25% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock from Gonzalez in exchange for the issuance of 20,000 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company and a Convertible Note in the principal amount of $10,000,000 issued by the Company (the “Gopher Convertible Note”) as well as the transfer and assignment of a Promissory Note payable by Gopher Protocol Costa Rica Sociedad De Responsabilidad Limitada to the Company in the principal amount of $5,000,000 dated February 6, 2019 (of which the underlying security for this Promissory Note is 30,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of Mobiquity Technologies, Inc. (“Mobiquity”) and 60,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of Mobiquity.
 
The Gopher Convertible Note bears interest of 6% per annum and is payable at maturity on December 31, 2021. At the election of Gonzalez, the Gopher Convertible Note can be converted into a maximum of 20,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder but subject to the Company increasing its authorized shares of common stock, into such number of shares of common stock of the Company as determined by dividing the Stated Value ($500 per share) by the conversion price ($500.00 per share). The Series H Preferred Stock has no liquidation preference, does not pay dividends and the holder of Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock that the Series H Preferred Stock may be convertible into. Upon conversion of the Gopher Convertible Note and the 20,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock, Gonzalez would be entitled to less than 50% of the resulting outstanding shares of common stock of the Company following conversion in full and, as a result, such transaction is not considered a change of control.
 
On May 19, 2021, the Company, entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement and Irrevocable Assignment of Note Balance Principal and Accrued Interest (the “Gonzalez Agreement”) with third party, GBT-CR, IGOR 1 Corp and Gonzalez Pursuant to the Gonzalez Agreement, without any party admission of liability and to avoid litigation, the parties has agreed to (i) extend the GBT Convertible Note maturity date to December 31,2022, (ii) amend the GBT Convertible Note terms to include a beneficial ownership blocker of 4.99% and a modified conversion feature to the GBT Convertible Note with 15% discount to the market price during the 20 trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date and (iii) provided for an assignment of the GBT Convertible Note by Gonzalez to a third party.
 
GBT-CR is in the business of the strategic management of BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) digital communications processing for enterprises and startups, distributed ledger technology development, AI development and fintech software development and applications.
 
The Company accounted for its investment in GBT-CR using the equity method of accounting; however, in 2020, the Company owned less than 20% after GBT-CR issued additional shares to other investors therefore exercised no control over GBT-CR; therefore, this investment is currently accounted for under the cost method. Moreover, on March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians and to establish consistency across the state in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. California was therefore under strict quarantine control and travel has been severely restricted, resulting in disruptions to work, communications, and access to files (due to limited access to facilities). The stay-at-home order was lifted in California only on January 25, 2021. As such, the Company was unable to access or to contact GBT-CR on an on-going basis, and cannot get information about GBT-CR.

Latinex (contra-equity account)
 
On January 8, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Pledge Agreement with Latin American Exchange Latinex Casa de Cambio, S.A., a Costa Rica corporation (“Latinex”), to provide that Latinex may maintain its required regulatory capital as required by various regulators.

In lieu of cash payment, Latinex may pay the Company in virtual currency of WISE Network S.A. valued at a 50% discount of its offering price of $10 per token. In the event that Latinex’s required capital has decreased below $5,000,000, Latinex is permitted to sell the pledged shares of common stock only in an amount to ensure that Latinex can satisfy the required capital levels. The Company must consent to such sale of the shares of common stock, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Upon expiration of the agreement, the remaining shares of common stock shall be returned to the Company free and clear of all liens. The Company has recorded the value of these shares of common stock as a stock loan receivable which is presented as a contra-equity account in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2019, the Company wrote off the accrued interest income as Latinex did not perform any payment and the Company has no mean to enforce this payment. Latinex agreed in principle to return the pledged 4,005 restricted shares to the Company for cancellation. The 4,005 restricted shares have not yet been returned to the Company as of December 31, 2021.
 
Regulatory
 
GBT Tokenize is seeking approval filing for its qTerm device with the United Stated Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA classifies medical devices from Class 1 – 3, each of which must be subjected to robust evaluations and reviews to comply with manufacturing quality control (QC) standards. The FDA regulates the marketing/sale of medical device products in the U.S. and monitors the safety of all regulated medical products. FDA Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) defines a device as: an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory which is recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. GBT Tokenize engaged M Squared Associates (M2) to assist with developing the FDA premarket strategy for its qTerm device. The process of filing for FDA clearance involves development of a sound regulatory strategy for pathway to market, including required preclinical and performance testing, software verification and validation activities and ensuring user needs are met. In addition, GBT/tokenize will partner with M2 to finalize technical design documentation, device labeling claims and intended use. Other aspects that will be evaluated include manufacturing processes, usability / human factors and the development of valid scientific evidence. The company will work with M2 to develop a detailed description of the device’s software and algorithm training requirements, including design specifications. qTerm computer program will be reviewed for its control functions and other required performance testing plans and criteria according to FDA guidance documentation. Even though not required by law, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in obtaining any regulatory approval. In order to successfully implement this concept, the Company will need to raise adequate capital to support its compliance research and, if successfully researched, developed and granted regulatory approval, the Company would need to enter into a strategic relationship with a third party that has experience in manufacturing, selling and distributing this product. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in any or all of these critical steps.
 
The Company is seeking to conduct business with the US government agencies and has hired a consulting firm for general guidance with the GSA (General Services Administration) application process. GSA approval status describes an organization that have been approved to sell to the United States Government through the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA is an independent agency of the United States Government that was established in 1949 to help manage, approve, and facilitate government contracts, products, bids and verify that product and services properly sourced under the US Government guidelines. The GSA is the purchasing department of the U.S. Government and lists contracts or schedules potential vendors that can bid on to get government business. To become eligible to bid on a GSA schedule, it is required to complete several important steps, among them are registering in the government’s SAM (System for Award Management), and providing previous customer contact information as a means for the GSA to perform a past performance evaluation. More information can be found on GSA web site at: https://www.gsa.gov. The Company applied and received their extension notice for SAM registration #832011626/91FW3 until May 2023. The active status makes GBT eligible to potentially contract business with US government contractors and sub-contractors, local cities or receive federal funds. SAM (www.sam.gov) is a central registration system for government contractors and suppliers. To remain eligible to do business with the federal government, an entity must renew its registration with SAM every year.


Intellectual Property
 
To date, the Company, has filed for different patents covering certain fields of its technologies, as well as trademarks. These patents and trademarks, as well as various websites and social media platforms, comprise the Company’s intellectual properties. On February 27, 2020 GBT Technologies, S.A., as successor in interest to Hermes Roll, LLC had notified the Company that it was in default on its Amended and Restated Territorial License Agreement (“ARTLA”) dated June 15, 2015 and that the ARTLA had been cancelled and rescinded.
 
On January 31, 2020, in the arbitration titled GBT Technologies Inc. (k/n/a Gopher Protocol, Inc. v. Discover Growth Fund, LLC (“Discover”) (JAMS Ref. No. 1260005395), the Company was informed that a final award was entered (the “Final Award”). The Final Award affirms that certain sections of the Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) constitute unenforceable liquidated damages penalties and were stricken. Further, it was determined that neither Discover nor John Kirkland, President and General Partner of Discover, were entitled to recovery of their attorney’s fees. Consequently, and consistent with the expectations of the Company, the arbitrator awarded Discover an award of $4,034,444 plus interest of 7.25% accrued from May 15, 2019 and costs in the amount of $55,613.00. On February 18, 2020, the Company filed a motion with the United States District Court District of Nevada (the “Nevada Court”) to confirm the Final Award and a motion to consolidate Discover’s application to confirm the Final Award filed in the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM) (the “Virgin Island Court”). On February 27, 2020, the Nevada Court denied the Company’s motion to confirm the Final Award and motion to consolidate and further decided that the confirmation of the Final Award should be litigated in the Virgin Island Court. As such, on February 27, 2020, the Company filed a Notice of Entry of Order as well as a Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award; Address the Outstanding issue regarding whether Discover’s rights are subordinated to other creditors and, thereafter, oversee a commercially reasonable foreclosure sale (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM). It was the Company’s position that the Final Award must first be confirmed and all questions regarding the rights of Discover relative to those of other creditors must be determined before any foreclosure sale can proceed. It was further the position of the Company that the previously disclosed foreclosure sale scheduled by Discover is being conducted in a commercially unreasonable manner and that if Discover proceeded forward with the foreclosure sale it did so at its own risk. Nevertheless, on February 28, 2020, Discover advised that it conducted a sale of the Company’s assets. As the date of this report Investor failed to present a deed of sale for the alleged sale that allegedly took place as noticed. The Company filed with Virgin Island Court the motions disputing the validity of the alleged sale. On July 28, 2020, Investor filed in the State of Nevada a motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716. The Company filed an answer on August 11, 2020. On October 16, 2020, Investor motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716 was denied. This case is still pending with the Federal court and the Court has not taken any substantive action in the matter as of the date of this report.
