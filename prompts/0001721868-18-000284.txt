ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
MassRoots was formed in April 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry. Powered by more than one million registered users, MassRoots enables consumers to rate cannabis products and strains based on their efficacy (i.e., effectiveness for treating ailments such as back-pain or epilepsy) and then presents this information in easy-to-use formats for consumers to make educated purchasing decisions at their local dispensary. Businesses are able to leverage MassRoots by strategically advertising to consumers based on their preferences and tendencies.
 
“Registered users” (“Users”) are defined as users who currently have an account with MassRoots. It does not include users who have deleted their account nor does it reflect active usage over any set period of time.
 
Background
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2420 17th Street, Office 3118, Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (833) 467-6687.

On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Whaxy Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of DDDigtal Inc (“DDDigtal”), a Colorado corporation. Upon closing of the Whaxy Merger, each share of DDDigtal’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof) based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 5.273-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 5.273 shares of DDDigtal’s common stock. At the closing of the Whaxy Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Whaxy Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of DDDigtal, and all shares of DDDigtal’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Whaxy Merger were automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Whaxy Merger, DDDigtal continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary (“Whaxy”), and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.


On July 13, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Odava Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Odava Inc (“Odava”), a Delaware corporation. Upon closing of the Odava Merger, each share of Odava’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof), based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 4.069-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 4.069 shares of Odava’s common stock. At the closing of the Odava Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Odava Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of Odava, and all shares of Odava’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Odava Merger automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Odava Merger, Odava continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.

Through this portal companies can edit their profiles, distribute information to Users and view analytics such as impressions, views and clicks.
Blockchain Technologies
 
In December 2017, we formed MassRoots Blockchain Technologies, Inc. (“MassRoots BlockChain”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, to explore how blockchain technology can be utilized in the cannabis industry.
 
From September 2017 until January 2018, we entered into Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, as amended and Restated on February 13, 2018 (the “Amended and Restated Agreement”), with ten investors pursuant to which we received aggregate proceeds of $942,500. From the proceeds received pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement, to date, we have invested approximately $250,000 in developing blockchain-powered features and utilities within our platform. In this regard, our efforts have been mainly focused on development of a digital instrument based on the ERC-20 standard that will run on the Ethereum network. Specifically, we entered into a Master Development Agreement with MEV, LLC (“MEV”), a company which is engaged in building digital products and services. Pursuant to the Master Development Agreement, MEV will provide, among other things, software development services, including, but not limited to, web and mobile development services, blockchain development and integration services and infrastructure development, automation, support and management services until February 1, 2019, unless such term is extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Upon completion of MEV’s engagement, MEV shall provide the Company with the source code for the developed systems, application programming interface documentation and such other materials developed by MEV during the course of its engagement.
 
Currently, a number of technology companies are attempting to curate the best information available on cannabis products and strains; however, the number of cannabis product reviews are low, such reviews are often biased and the most commonly reviewed products receive greater exposure than the less reviewed products, which results in incomplete information for consumers who utilize such reviews for making purchasing decisions. To provide additional information so that cannabis consumers can make better informed purchasing decisions, we plan to utilize digital instruments as a form of reward based currency within the MassRoots platform to encourage high-quality reviews, including reviews of new products, which we believe will also incentivize User-growth and stimulate our platform’s overall activity.
 
Initially, we intend to have our online platform, which includes the MassRoots App and MassRoots Retail, provide a closed-loop ecosystem and network incentives to provide a healthy microeconomy for our digital instruments. Users may earn digital instruments on the MassRoots platform by writing high quality reviews on cannabis strains and products and then may use such digital instruments to purchase upgrades on the MassRoots App, to purchase products on the MassRoots online store and as a way for industry participants, including dispensaries, to pay for advertisements on the MassRoots network.

Although we initially intend for the digital instruments to be used in a closed-loop ecosystem, we believe that our digital instruments may be used by businesses in the cannabis industry including ancillary businesses such as vaporizer companies. For example, businesses in the cannabis industry may elect to utilize the MassRoots platform to develop customer loyalty programs to award our digital instruments for purchasing certain products or reaching certain spending/order levels. Users may then be able to use our digital instruments to purchase non-cannabis good or services. In addition, businesses in the cannabis industry may issue our digital instruments to incentivize a range of actions by producers, consumers, and other industry participants, such as attendance at workshops and interaction with product or brand ambassadors at industry events.
 
In addition to the foregoing, independent of our digital instruments, we are developing blockchain-powered features which we believe will enable MassRoots to better track impressions, views, and interactions with posts, advertisements and dispensary listings. This is intended to be an integral part of our revamped business portal. We also believe that blockchain-powered utilities have the potential to allow us to implement an intelligent newsfeed to deliver high-quality and more relevant content to our Users.
 
Furthermore, through MassRoots BlockChain, we are exploring how blockchain technology can be utilized for purposes including, but not limited to:
 

· | Identity Management. Social networks such as MassRoots collect a significant amount of metadata on its users. Blockchain has the potential to streamline the collection and organization of such data while eliminating traditional security risks. This would enable advertisers to better target consumers, reduce the risk of security breaches, and enable the development of solutions that better serve the MassRoots community.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Eliminating Intermediaries. In the sharing economy as it exists today, buyers and sellers have to go through intermediaries to conduct a transaction. For example, people use AirBnB for short-term housing rentals and Uber for ride-sharing. The blockchain may enable peer-to-peer transactions without third parties allowing for the verification of personal and business reputation thereby being more reliable. In addition, the blockchain may eliminate the costs associated with intermediaries. MassRoots Blockchain is exploring how such technology can be applied to producers of cannabis and the dispensaries that purchase from them.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Smart Contracts. Blockchain may enable the development of contracts that are automatically executed when certain parameters are met. For example, a dispensary may be able to automatically order more supply of a particular strain when its inventory reaches a certain threshold. The smart contract has the potential to add efficiency to the supply chain and resource planning processes within the cannabis industry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seed-To-Sale Traceability. Distributed ledger technology provides a greater degree of reliability and accuracy on the metadata associated with products such as times, dates, locations and quantities, all of which have the potential to reduce friction in the cannabis market-place, save businesses valuable resources, and provide greater transparency to government regulators. According to an article published by Bloomberg Technology in November 2017, IBM is also exploring how blockchain can improve seed-to-sale traceability in the cannabis market. MassRoots Blockchain is exploring how this new technology can improve its point-of-sale system, MassRoots Retail.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Corporate Governance. Blockchain has the potential to make the validation and results of elections fully-transparent and immediately accessible online. MassRoots Blockchain is exploring how distributed-ledger technology may be applied to voting at stockholders’ meetings thereby providing stockholders with a greater degree of transparency and communication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we and MassRoots BlockChain are devoting development resources to exploring the feasibility of developing these solutions, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in implementing any of the foregoing solutions, that such solutions will be economically viable, or that it will result in the generation of revenue from such solutions.
 
We currently anticipate that we and/or MassRoots BlockChain will need to raise additional funds to continue to explore and develop potential uses and applications of our anticipated digital instruments and blockchain technology for our business and other businesses in the cannabis industry; however, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.

App/Play Store Issues, User Support and Similar Matters
 
On November 4, 2014, the MassRoots App was removed from Apple’s iOS App Store because the App Store changed its guidelines to prohibit the promotion of social cannabis applications. Although existing iOS Users were still able to access and use the MassRoots App, new users were prohibited from downloading our app. After correspondences with Apple, other cannabis companies and cannabis advocates, in February 2015 Apple advised us that it revised its enforcement guidelines to permit cannabis applications in the Apple App Store which restricted access to users located in the states where use of cannabis was permitted. On February 12, 2015, our application was reinstated to the Apple App Store and can now only be accessed by users in the states which permit the use of cannabis. Although our app has been reinstated to the Apple App Store, we cannot provide any assurance that Apple’s policy will not change in the future or that our application will not once again be removed from the Apple App Store.
 
The Apple App Store is one of the largest content distribution channels in the world and is the only way to effectively distribute software to the large percentage of the United States population who own iPhones and iPads. The Apple App Store review team effectively operates as our iOS App’s regulator; they decide what guidelines iOS apps must operate under and how to enforce such guidelines. The Apple guidelines related to cannabis-related apps are not published, enforcement of such guidelines is difficult to predict, and the review and appeal processes are conducted without public oversight. Although we will continue advocating for a more open and transparent Apple App Store review process that will allow decisions that affect a significant portion of the United States smartphone owning population to be open to public scrutiny, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
 
MassRoots, along with other cannabis apps, regularly encounter issues with the Google Play Store review team in the normal course of business due to Google Play Store’s absence of clear guidelines regarding cannabis-related apps. On November 8, 2016, the MassRoots App was removed from the Google Play Store due to a compliance review. However, on March 21, 2017, Google approved the MassRoots App for distribution to Android devices through the Google Play Store, making it available for download on the Google Play Store once again.
 
On December 1, 2016, MassRoots’ Android application received approval from the Amazon App Store for listing, and is currently available for download on the Amazon App Store.

Under their respective developer license agreements, Apple, Inc., Google, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. have the right to update the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and Amazon App Store policies, respectively, to prohibit cannabis-related applications at any time. This could result in many prospective users being unable to access and join our network and existing Users being unable to access our app.
 
Our activities outside of the application stores have also faced backlash and resistance due to our status as a cannabis-related company. For example, our Instagram account is followed by more than 450,000 users and we utilize this following to help expand our user-base. However, in a situation similar to the removal of our application from the Apple App Store, our Instagram account was suspended in January 2016 without notice or explanation. Our account was reinstated on February 26, 2016. While management believes that our platform is at the point where any potential suspensions effecting our Company will not affect our User growth, we expect to continue to face similar situations in the future that may cause disruptions to the execution of our business plan.
 
Market Conditions
 
MassRoots is poised to take advantage of two rapidly growing industries: cannabis and mobile technology.
 
Cannabis Market Growth and Current Trends
 
Since the MassRoots app first launched in July 2013, on January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo which rescinded the Cole Memo (as described below) which was adopted by the Obama administration as a policy of non-interference with marijuana-friendly state laws.
The Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo (the “Cole Memo”) in response to certain states passing measures to legalize the medical and adult-use of cannabis. In the Cole Memo, the Department of Justice made clear that marijuana remains an illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act and that federal prosecutors will continue to aggressively enforce the statute. The Department of Justice identified eight enforcement areas that federal prosecutors should prioritize. Outside of such enforcement priorities, the federal government has traditionally relied on state and local authorities to address marijuana activity. The Cole Memo established several basic guidelines by which state-legal cannabis businesses could operate to minimize the risk of intervention and enforcement by the Department of Justice. The guidelines focused on ensuring that cannabis did not cross state lines, keeping dispensaries away from schools and public facilities and strict-enforcement of state laws by regulatory agencies, among other priorities.
The Sessions Memo
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo (the “Sessions Memo”) on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous nationwide guidance by the Department of Justice (including, but not limited to, the Cole Memo). In the memorandum, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions directs all U.S. attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow the well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. These principles include weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.

Guidance to Banks Relating to the Marijuana Industry
 
On February 14, 2014, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury issued guidance to banks about how to serve the marijuana industry without running afoul of federal regulations. Prior to such guidance, dispensaries were forced to operate on a cash basis, presenting significant security and accounting issues. Although banks have remained reluctant to work with marijuana businesses because of federal prohibition laws, this guidance was a major step in legitimizing and accepting the cannabis industry on a national level. In addition, the adoption of the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment (as discussed below) indicates some level of support in Congress for medicinal cannabis, even if its actual effect is still undetermined.
 
For additional information concerning the Cole Memo, the Sessions Member, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment and regulatory conditions, see the section entitled “Business – Government Regulation.”
 
Current States with Laws Permitting the Medical or Adult Use of Cannabis
 
According to CNN Money, recreational marijuana is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia and medical marijuana is legal in 30 states (CNN Money, The U.S. legal Marijuana Industry is Booming, http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/31/news/marijuana-state-of-the-union/index.html). The states which have enacted such laws are listed below the following map:

(ProCon, 29 Legal Medical Marijuana States and DC, https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881; CNN Money, The U.S. legal Marijuana Industry is Booming, http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/31/news/marijuana-state-of-the-union/index.html)
 
Public Support for Legalization Increasing
 
A Quinnipiac poll conducted in February 2017 found that 93% of the American people supported legalizing the medicinal use of cannabis, 59% supported legalizing the adult-use of cannabis and 71% of Americans were opposed to federal government interference with state marijuana programs. These statistics continue the trend over the past decade toward public support for cannabis.
Market Conditions that Could Limit Our Business
 
Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law and, as such, there are several factors that could limit our business operations including, but not limited to:

· | The Federal government and many private employers prohibit drug use of any kind, including cannabis, even where it is permissible under state law. Random drug screenings and potential enforcement of such employment provisions may significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enforcement of Federal law prohibiting cannabis occurs randomly and often without notice. This could scare many potential investors away from cannabis-related investments and makes it difficult to make accurate market predictions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice issued the Sessions Memo announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents. The Sessions Memo rescinded the Cole Memo. Although there is no guarantee that additional states will pass measures to legalize cannabis use under state law, the Sessions Memo may further deter states from passing such measures. Furthermore, irrespective of the Sessions Memo, in many states, public support of legalization initiatives may not maintain enough support to pass. This is especially true when a supermajority is needed to pass measures, like in Florida where a state constitutional amendment permitting medical cannabis has been proposed, but requires 60% approval to pass. Changes due to the Sessions Memo and in voters’ attitudes and turnout have the potential to slow or stop the cannabis legalization movement and potentially reverse recent cannabis legalization victories; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | There has been some resistance and negativity as a result of recent cannabis legalization at the state level, especially as it relates to drugged driving. The lack of clearly defined and enforced laws at the state level has the potential to sway public opinion against marijuana legalization; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In the event that the Federal government does not enforce the Federal law prohibiting cannabis, the legality of the state laws regarding the legalization of cannabis are being challenged through lawsuits. Lawsuits have been brought by private groups and local law enforcement officials. If these lawsuits are successful, state laws permitting cannabis sales may be overturned which will significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market and have a material adverse effect on our business.

Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. However, 30 states have passed state laws that permit doctors to recommend cannabis for medical-use and eight of those states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that legalize the adult-use of cannabis for any reason (CNN Money, The U.S. legal Marijuana Industry is Booming, http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/31/news/marijuana-state-of-the-union/index.html). Because doctors are prohibited from prescribing a Schedule I controlled substance, the passage of a state medical marijuana does not necessarily guarantee the implementation of a regulated, commercial system through which patients can purchase cannabis products. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that legally operate under certain state laws but in violation of Federal law.
Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under certain state laws, so long as:

· | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there is not any violence or use of firearms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Cole Memo was a guide for United States attorneys and did not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. As described below, as a result of the issuance of the Sessions Memo by the Department of Justice on January 4, 2018, the Cole memo was rescinded. Prior to the issuance of the Sessions Memo, we had implemented standard operating procedures and policies to ensure that we were operating in compliance with the Cole Memo. We cannot provide assurance that our actions were, are or will be in compliance with the Cole Memo, the Sessions Memo or any other laws or regulations that currently exist or may be amended or adopted in the future.
 
Pursuant to our currently existing Terms and Conditions:
 

· | Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is legal; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Users must be of legal age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state’s laws; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through MassRoots unless they are a licensed dispensary; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Posting of any of the following materials to MassRoots is prohibited and will result in account termination: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

·                  Posting other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills;
 
·                  Posting of any violence or threat of violence;
 
·                  Posting of any drugged-driving content; and
 
·                  Posting of any copyright-protected content.
 
We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions. Users have the ability to report any status or account that is in violation of our Terms and Conditions and we encourage Users to do so as any illegal content jeopardizes the network for all our Users. When a status or account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the network until further review. A MassRoots employee then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as in compliance within our Terms and Conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the User’s account.
 
In addition, as part of the agreement to allow our app to return to the Apple App Store, we implemented geographic restrictions to restrict new Users to our mobile apps to the District of Columbia and the 30 states in which the use of marijuana is permitted.
 
Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our network, which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We continue to evaluate the effects of the Sessions Memo; however, we cannot provide assurance that we were, are or will be in compliance with the Cole Memo, the Sessions Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision known as the “Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
 
The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws – and has continued to sporadically initiate enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being legal under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice’s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what the interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and is in effect until September 30, 2018.

Sessions Memo
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous nationwide guidance by the Department of Justice (including, but not limited to, the Cole Memo). In the memorandum, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions directs all U.S. attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. These principles include weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. The effect of this memo is to shift federal policy from a hands-off approach adopted by the Obama administration to permitting federal prosecutors across the country to determine how to prioritize resources to regulate marijuana possession, distribution and cultivation in states where marijuana use is legal.


While we do not directly harvest or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law, or aiding and abetting the violation of Federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
Additional Government Regulations
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. These regulations and laws cover among others, sweepstakes, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. Any noncompliance with the foregoing laws and regulations may harm our business and results of operations.
Competitors
 
We compete with other cannabis information platforms such as WeedMaps and Leafly, which provide information with respect to dispensary locations, strain information, and news relating to the cannabis industry. We believe our primary competitive advantage is the social functionality of our platform enables users to build an online personality and preferences and follow other Users with similar interests compared to other platforms such as WeedMaps and Leafly which utilize anonymous and non-personalized profiles.
 
Network effects may have an impact on our market share unlike some other companies which do not have positive network effects. For example, Google+ failed to obtain a dominant market share in desktop-based social networking because it was introduced after Facebook already dominated the market. Similarly, management believes that even if additional competitors to MassRoots were to emerge, Users would still utilize our services as we have a large and diverse community constantly providing up-to-date reviews and information and our platform provides customization of User profiles.
