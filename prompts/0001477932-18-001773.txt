The Company changed its name from Hemcare Health Services to DLT Resolution to better align with its business activities on December 4, 2017.

The Company offers secure data management, Information Technology (IT) and other telecommunications services in Canada and the United States. Through its RecordsBank.org portal it operates a Health Information Exchange. DLT is creating a single unified platform enabling the ability to request and retrieve medical information and records while meeting all of today’s Security & Compliance demands for HIPAA, PIPEDA and PHIPA. The Company is preparing to launch a Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” version of the service placing electronic health records on this secure platform. The Company expects to launch this initiative during the third calendar quarter of 2018.

Business Strategy
 
DLT Resolution’s strategy is to provide secure data management to organizations large and small across Canada and the USA. Included with data management are telecom and other IT solutions to assist organizations with offloading burdensome back office services and thus helping clients achieve operational efficiency. 
Through the deployment of the Company’s Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” solution, DLT aims to leverage our offerings adding benefits previously unattainable in the marketplace.
 
Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain”
 
Our Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” permits trust to be intrinsically embedded into a technological solution, enabling smooth partnerships and transactions dramatically reducing friction between stakeholders. Our solutions focus primarily within the Health Information Exchange and Telecommunications space.
Workflow Automation
 
Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” enabled trust improves coordination between various partners, due to a shared view of transactions and liabilities. This in turn permits the elimination of third parties, resulting in cost savings
Audit Trail
 
Facilitates a single view of data instead of the need for consolidation across various disparate systems. Resulting in reliable audit trails due to the history of all transactions being available in the ledger.
Data Privacy
 
Provable privacy protects clients’ data from being visible to unauthorized parties in compliance with all of today's HIPPA requirements
 
Revenue Assurance
 
Implementation of smart contracts allows for near-instantaneous charging, thus leading to improved revenue assurance and fraud reduction.

Health Information Exchange
 
DLT Resolution has developed and recently launched RecordsBank.org, a Centralized System for Patients, Lawyers & Insurers to retrieve and access Medical Records. The centralized system and portal is a cloud-based PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant network of Providers and Record Requestors. Utilizing a secure platform, providers will be able to securely exchange records electronically with third-party requestors. Health care providers with proper authorization can also share records with each other. The system works on a fee per record basis with future plans of licensing medical data, stripped of identifiers for medical research.
Addressing a $7 Billion a Year Problem 
 
In national terms, across the U.S., hospitals spend more than $7 billion annually on customer intake. More than $7 billion, before any sort of medical procedure is done; before a patient even steps out of a waiting room, representing an incredible amount of time and money spent on intake administration.
 
Despite the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE), providers are still mailing and faxing paper records because they have no PIPEDA or HIPAA compliant method to exchange records electronically with these third-party requestors. Based on our research, the Company estimates the current method of exchanging patient health information may cost a single clinician practice approximately $17,000 per year. 
 
The Company aims to remove these substantial burdens both on an administrative and financial basis. People or firms simply use our secure online request form, pay a small service fee and the Company retrieves, digitizes and stores the records. At this point the requesting client can access the record globally 24 hours a day - 7 days a week to view it or transfer it securely. In fact clients can upload any new records to consolidate and keep all of their records securely in one place. 
Reports to Security Holders
 
We file our quarterly and annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which the public may view and copy at the Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E. Washington D.C. 20549. SEC filings, including supplemental schedule and exhibits, can also be accessed free of charge through the SEC website www.sec.gov.
