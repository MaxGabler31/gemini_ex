Description of Business
 
Company Overview
 
Biotricity Inc. (“Company”, “Biotricity”, “we”, “us” or “our”)
 
Biotricity Inc. (the “Company”, “Biotricity”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a medical technology company focused on biometric data monitoring solutions. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote monitoring solutions to the medical, healthcare, and consumer markets, with a focus on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. We approach the diagnostic side of remote patient monitoring by applying innovation within existing business models where reimbursement is established. We believe this approach reduces the risk associated with traditional medical device development and accelerates the path to revenue. In post-diagnostic markets, we intend to apply medical grade biometrics to enable consumers to self-manage, thereby driving patient compliance and reducing healthcare costs. We intend to first focus on a segment of the diagnostic mobile cardiac telemetry market, otherwise known as MCT, while providing our chosen markets with the capability to also perform other cardiac studies.
 
We developed our FDA-approved Bioflux® MCT technology, comprised of a monitoring device and software components, which we made available to the market under limited release on April 6, 2018, in order to assess, establish and develop sales processes and market dynamics. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 marked the Company’s first year of expanded commercialization efforts, focused on sales growth and expansion. We have since expanded our sales efforts to over 300 centers (estimated as market penetration of more than 1,500 cardiologists) across 27 states, with intention to penetrate further and compete in the broader US market using an insourcing business model, before expending into international markets. Our technology has a large potential total addressable market, which can include hospitals, clinics and physicians’ offices, as well as other Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (“IDTFs)”. We believe our solution’s insourcing model, which empowers physicians with state-of-the-art technology and charges technology service fees for its use, has the benefit of a reduced operating overhead for the Company, and enables a more efficient market penetration and distribution strategy. This, when combined with the value the Company’s solution in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, enhancement of patient outcomes, improved patient compliance, and the corresponding reduction of healthcare costs, is driving growth and increasing revenues.
 
We are a technology company focused on earning utilization-based recurring technology fee revenue. The Company’s ability to grow this type of revenue is predicated on the size and quality of its sales force and their ability to penetrate the market and place devices with clinically focused, repeat users of its cardiac study technology. The Company plans to grow its sales force in order to address new markets and achieve sales penetration in the markets currently served.
 
The fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 marked the trailing 24-month period of full market release of the Bioflux MCT device for commercialization, originally launched in limited market release in April 2018, after receiving its second and final required FDA clearance. To commence commercialization, we ordered device inventory from our FDA-approved manufacturer and hired a small, captive sales force, with deep experience in cardiac technology sales; we expanded on our limited market release, which identified potential anchor clients who could be early adopters of our technology. By increasing our sales force and geographic footprint, we had launched sales in 27 U.S. states by March 31, 2022.
 
On January 24, 2022 the Company announced that it has received the 510(k) FDA clearance of its Biotres patch solution, which is a novel product in the field of Holter monitoring. This three-lead technology can provide connected Holter monitoring that is designed to produce more accurate recordings than is typical of competing 1 channel holter solutions. One of the key features, connectivity, enables faster data availability, reducing data access time from 2 weeks to 3 days. The Company officially launched sales of this product in April 2022.
 
During 2021, the Company also announced that it received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its Bioflux Software II System, engineered to improve workflows. ECG monitoring requires significant human oversight to review and interpret incoming patient data to discern actionable events for clinical intervention, highlighting the necessity of driving operational efficiency. This improvement reduces operational costs and allows the company to continue to focus on excellent customer service to physicians and their at-risk patients. Additionally, these advances mean we can focus our resources on high-level operations and sales to help drive greater revenue.


The Company has also developed or is developing several other ancillary technologies, which will require application for further FDA clearances, which the Company anticipates applying for within the next to twelve months. Among these are:
 

● | advanced ECG analysis software that can analyze and synthesize patient ECG monitoring data with the purpose of distilling it down to the important information that requires clinical intervention, while reducing the amount of human intervention necessary in the process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the Bioflux® 2.0, which is the next generation of our award winning Bioflux® 

 
During fiscal 2022, the Company also commercially launched its Bioheart technology, which is a consumer technology whose development was forged out of prior the development of the clinical technologies that are already part of the Company’s technology ecosystem.. This technology and other consumer technologies and applications such as the Biokit and Biocare have been developed to allow the Company to transform and use its strong cardiac footprint to expand into remote chronic care management market that will be part of the Biotricity ecoysytem.


In August 2021, the Company’s common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In June 2022, the Company announced that it was joining the Russell Microcap® Index.


The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring technologies. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, the Company has continued to develop its telemedicine platform, with capabilities of real-time streaming of medical devices. Telemedicine offers patients the ability to communicate directly with their health care providers without the need of leaving their home. The introduction of a telemedicine solution is intended to align with the Company’s Bioflux product and facilitate remote visits and remote prescriptions for cardiac diagnostics, but it is also intended to serve as a means of establishing referral and other synergies across the network of doctors and patients that use the technologies we are building within the Biotricity ecosystem. The intention is to continue to provide improved care to patients that may otherwise elect not to go to medical facilities and continue to provide economic benefits and costs savings to healthcare service providers and payers that reimburse.
 
Market Overview
 
Chronic diseases are the number one burden on the healthcare system, driving up costs year over year. Lifestyle related illnesses such as obesity and hypertension are the top contributing factors of chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. Government and healthcare organizations are focused on driving costs down by shifting to evidence-based healthcare where individuals, especially those suffering from chronic illnesses, engage in self-management. This has led to growth in the connected health market, which is projected to reach $150 billion by 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%1. Remote patient monitoring (RPM), one of the key areas of focus for self-management and evidence-based practice, is projected to reach $31.3 billion by 20232. Currently, more than seven million patients benefit from remote monitoring and the use of connected medical devices3, and nearly 1,800 hospitals4 in the US are using mobile applications to improve risk management and care quality.
 
The number one cost to the healthcare system is cardiovascular disease, estimated to be responsible for 1 in every 6 healthcare dollars spent in the US5. Since cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death worldwide, early detection, diagnosis, and management of chronic cardiac conditions are necessary to relieve the increasing burden on the healthcare infrastructure. Diagnostic tests such as ECGs are used to detect, diagnose and track certain types of cardiovascular conditions. We believe that the rise of lifestyle related illnesses associated with heart disease has created a need to develop cost-effective diagnostic mechanisms to fill a hole in the current ECG market.
 
The global ECG market is growing at a CAGR of 5.6%6. The factors driving this market include an aging population, an increase in chronic diseases related to lifestyle choices, improved technology in diagnostic ECG devices, and high growth rates of ECG device sales. As of 2015, the United States accounted for approximately 27% of the global ECG market7 and is comprised of three major segments: resting (non-stress) ECG systems, stress ECG systems, and holter monitoring systems.

In the US, MCT tests are primarily conducted through outsourced Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (IDTFs) that are reimbursed at an estimated average rate of approximately $850 per diagnostic test, based on pricing information provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and weighted towards the largest markets of New York, California, Texas and Florida. Reimbursement rates can be lower in smaller markets, although the national average is $801. Further, we believe private insurers provide for similar or better reimbursement rates.
 
We launched a limited market release of our MCT diagnostic device and software solution in April 2018. In April 2019, we officially launched our solution and expanded our sales efforts to 6 key states, with intention to expand further and compete in the broader US market using an insourcing business model. This business model is applicable to a large portion of the total available market, which can include hospitals, physicians’ offices and other IDTFs. We believe our solution’s insourcing model, which empowers physicians with state of the art technology and charges technology service fees for its use, has the benefit of a reduced operating overhead for the Company, and enables a more efficient market penetration and distribution strategy.
 
Our initial device offering intends to revolutionize the MCT market by providing a convenient, cost-effective, integrated MCT solution, inclusive of both software and hardware for physician providers and their patients. Biotricity, however, has a broader strategic vision to offer an ecosystem of technologies that engage the patient-user and their medical practitioner(s) in sustained monitoring, diagnosis, communication and pro-active treatment of patient chronic care conditions. Our core solution is designed as a platform to encompass multiple segments of the remote monitoring market, and the future growth of that market.
 
Market Opportunity
 
ECGs are a key diagnostic test utilized in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death worldwide. The global ECG market is growing at a CAGR of 5.6%, and, assuming the U.S. continues to hold approximately 27% of the global market (based on 2017 statistics), approximately $1.8 billion would be attributed to the US ECG market1,2. In the US in 2016, statistics show that there were 121.5 million adults3 living with cardiovascular disease, whereas 28.2 million adults4 had been diagnosed with the disease. The increasing market size is attributed to an aging population and an influx in chronic diseases related to lifestyle choices.
 
The US ECG market is divided into three major product segments:
 

1. | Event monitoring systems; 
---+--------------------------------------
2. | Stress ECG systems; and 
3. | Resting (non-stress) ECG systems. 

 
Event monitoring systems are projected to grow the fastest due to a shift from in-hospital/clinic monitoring to outpatient monitoring. This shift is expected to help reduce health care costs by limiting the number of overnight hospital stays for patient monitoring. We believe that physicians prefer event monitoring systems over resting and stress ECG systems because they provide better insight to the patient’s condition for diagnostic purposes.
 
The event monitoring market is divided into the Holter/Extended Holter, Event Loop and Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) product segments, of which Holter, and its variant Extended Holter, and Event Loop are the current market leaders. Among event monitoring systems, we believe that the preferred choice of physicians and cardiologists is MCT, because of its ability to continuously monitor patients in real-time, thereby reducing a patient’s risk and a physician’s liability. MCT devices have built-in arrhythmia detectors and real-time communication, which allow physicians to prescribe the device for a longer period of time; thereby enabling prolonged data collection and delivering a more complete picture for diagnosis.
 
Typical Holter/Extended Holter and Event Loop solutions lack the ability to alert the patient in the event of an emergency. Holter is used a short term solution, up to 3 days, whereas Event Loop is used for up to 30 days. Extended Holter, the long term variant of Event Loop can be used for up 21 days. It is the most recent of the cardiac monitoring options and was created for longer term holter recordings. Since Event Loop is also long term, reimbursement for Extended Holter and Event Loop are converging. Reimbursement for these are much lower compared to MCT due to the nature of the solution, recording vs monitoring. With Holter and Event Loop monitoring, ECG data is not uploaded or transmitted in real-time. Comparatively, if the patient were monitored through an MCT device with real-time ECG data transfer and cellular network access, then in the event of cardiac distress, the monitoring center would immediately send communication to the patient’s physician.

In order to properly administer the MCT test, a healthcare provider must have access to three essential components:
 

1. | The MCT device; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | An ECG reporting software that is capable of reading the data recorded from the device; and 
3. | A monitoring center that collects the ECG data and responds to the patient in case of an alarm detection. 

 
Since MCT requires an FDA-cleared device (meaning for our purposes that it can be used to review medical ECG data from ECG devices), FDA-cleared ECG reporting software, and remote monitoring capabilities, regulatory and development hurdles have resulted in relatively few companies being able to successfully develop an all-encompassing solution. We believe that there are currently only 5 MCT solutions within the market. Some of these solutions are sold to the market through solutions providers that have not developed and do not manufacture their own device.


Of the MCT systems currently available in the market, most are owned by IDTFs who employ an outsourcing business model, focused on providing clinical services for which they can earn reimbursement; this means that they would typically not sell their devices to physicians, but offer their clinical services. Some MCT providers choose to sell their solution by charging high prices for devices and upfront software costs, as well as a per cardiac study monitoring fee. Among these are solutions that are not scalable; some lack monitoring software, requiring a customer to acquire third party software and incur integration expenses. These would require an investment by the physician, to incur upfront costs that would take time to recoup before profits are realized. The only other model available in the market is based on a monthly fee for technology and devices, irrespective of usage, forcing the physician to pay whether the technology is used or not.
 
The limited number of competitors makes this an attractive market for new entrants. However, entry into the market requires a hardware device coupled with complex algorithms, ECG software and access to a monitoring center. Two of the five MCT players have done so by building their own monitoring infrastructure, developing their own ECG software and utilizing TZ Medical’s MCT device. However, this is capital intensive and we believe cost prohibitive for most hospitals and clinics. These barriers are in our opinion among the key reasons as to why Holter and Event Loop have maintained a significant portion of the US event monitoring market despite the increase in patient safety and improved outcomes with MCT.
 
The Bioflux MCT solution and business model attempts to address these complications with its complete, turn-key solution, which consists of all three essential components: an easy-to-wear GSM-enabled cardiac monitoring device, ECG reporting software, and facilitation of physician-based monitoring that may utilize outsourced data screening. Bioflux employs an insourced business model, whereby our Bioflux device is sold to physicians; they own the device, and then use our back-office technology to monitor their patient and supervise the cardiac study as they perform and read their patient’s ECG; we earn technology service fees as physicians use our back office software solution. Our revenue model relies on increased market penetration through the sale of devices and the use of our back office software to service the needs of the physician. The physician, in turn, earns reimbursement as the practitioner who supervises and provides the cardiac study, obtains diagnostic data and makes treatment decisions.
 
Our Bioflux MCT solution is comprised of a separate monitoring device and an ECG reporting software component. Our Bioflux solution provides:
 

● | a revenue model for physicians that fits within the established insurance billing practices, with recurring reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and IDTFs, since the device can be washed and used multiple times on multiple patients requiring an MCT study; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | built-in cellular connectivity, enabling immediate alert to user in the event of an emergency; 
● | technology that is future-ready, in that its form and function enables opportunities to develop and use technologies adjacent to the MCT market.

Following Bioflux, the Company developed several breakthrough technologies in 2021, including:
 

● | Biotres, a unique ECG Holter solution that addresses the limitations of existing solutions in the Holter market, with built-in connectivity, ability to recharge, and 3 channels (instead of 1). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Bioheart, a unique personal cardiac monitoring solution for consumers that addresses the limitations of existing solutions, designed with built-in connectivity, ability to recharge, and 3 channels. 

Market Strategy
 
The Bioflux MCT device is expected to be deployed into physicians’ offices, clinics, hospitals, and IDTFs. For the prescribing physician, the MCT diagnostic read is a reimbursable service from payers such as Medicare and insurance companies. In the United States, billing codes for an MCT diagnostic read are currently available under the American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminal, with a current average reimbursement rate of $850 per read (a read is between 1 and 30 days long).
 
We believe that Bioflux’s revenue model, which is a platform or technology as a service model (PAAS or TAAS), is a significant and disruptive departure from the pricing and reimbursement strategies of the existing competitors in the MCT market, which apply an outsourced model to MCT diagnostics, where the entire procedure and reimbursement is outsourced; the MCT solutions provider takes over the clinical responsibilities and earns the reimbursement and pays the physician a small administrative stipend. Bioflux’s revenue and insourced business model entail differentiators that are expected to create barriers to entry for other competitors seeking to emulate our strategy.
 
On October 18, 2016, we announced that we have received a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the software component of our Bioflux solution. On completion of required testing and submission of results, on December 18, 2017 we announced that we received our second 510(k) clearance for our Bioflux device, thereby achieving the final FDA requirement needed for Biotricity to bring Bioflux to the U.S. market. On April 6, 2018, we began a limited market release with a roll-out of our first devices to cardiologists, physicians, research scientists and other opinion leaders related to the Company. Our first year was focused on ensuring reimbursement was in place and our workflow aligned with customer needs. In 2019, we moved into an official launch to strategically target our addressable market of approximately 2,213 physician offices (approximately 1% of all physician offices in the U.S.), 58 hospitals (approximately 1% of all hospitals in the U.S.), and 30 IDTFs (an estimated 1% of all IDTFs in the U.S.). To do this, we invested in the hiring of top caliber sales professionals with a proven track record in cardiac technology and device sales, and strong business relationships with providers of cardiac medical services.
 
Product and Technology
 
Bioflux is an advanced, integrated ECG device and software solution for the MCT market. The Bioflux device is comprised of a wet electrode and worn on a belt clip around the waist.

Future Markets
 
In the next few years, we intend to expand use of our technology platform with medical-grade solutions for the monitoring of blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, chronic pain, as well as fetal monitoring, and other adjacent healthcare and lifestyle markets.
 
Preventative Care. It is widely reported that chronic illnesses related to lifestyle diseases are on the rise, resulting in increased healthcare costs. This has caused a major shift in the US healthcare market, emphasizing a need for evidence-based healthcare system focused on overall health outcomes. Patient compliance is a critical component in driving improved health outcomes, where the patient adheres to and implements their physician’s recommendation. Unfortunately, poor patient compliance is one of the most pressing issues in the healthcare market. One of the key contributing factors to this is the lack of a feedback mechanism to measure improvement and knowledge. Studies show that poor patient compliance costs the US healthcare system $100 to $289 billion annually1, representing 3% to 10% of total US healthcare costs2. Studies have proven that regular monitoring of chronic care conditions improves patient outcomes in the form of lower morbidity rates and reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system by empowering preventative care. The Company has developed a technology that will support medical practitioners as they gather data and regularly monitor and treat patients with two or more of the top ten chronic care conditions that plague individuals. We expect that Bioheart, our planned third product, will be focused on filling this need by developing a clinically relevant, preventative care and disease management solution for the consumer. A key underlying component of Bioheart is expected to be the ability to measure patient improvements—with clinical accuracy—which will drive feedback and eventual patient compliance. This approach is implemented in our development process by focusing on a disease/chronic illness profile, as opposed to a customer profile. We are focused on cardiovascular disease for our first preventative care solution since Bioflux is aimed at the same health segment. This will enable us to leverage the knowledge and expertise gained with Bioflux and apply it to Bioheart.
 
Adjacent Chronic Healthcare Markets and Prenatal Care. In the next few years, we intend to expand our reach with medical-grade solutions for diabetes, sleep apnea, fetal monitoring, and other adjacent healthcare and lifestyle markets.
 
Bionatal is a proposed product for monitoring fetus’ health by remote cardiac telemetry. In the US, there were approximately 24,073 fetal deaths at 20 or more weeks gestation in 20123. The rise of older mothers and mothers with chronic conditions have driven high-risk pregnancies to a new high; high-risk complications now occur in 6 to 8 percent of all pregnancies4.

Holter and Event Monitoring. The Holter and Event Loop monitors are significantly simplified versions of an MCT device without a cellular connectivity solution. Holter and Event Loop monitors require data to be downloaded manually, for test periods of 24 hours to 30 days. The Bioflux MCT device software has been adjusted to be able to be used as a Holter/Extended Holter or an Event loop monitor, which has already opened up the Holter and Event Loop monitor markets, by combining with Bioflux’s global cellular chipset to become a 4 in 1 device that is applicable to the global event monitoring market.
 
The key leading technologies in the Holter market are patch devices that take the form of a large band-aid and can be mailed back or returned to the physician for data retrieval. They lack connectivity, have only one channel of data, and cannot be charged but are convenient for low-risk patients. Responding to our customer needs, the Company has developed a new technology that is applicable to this space which will continue to adhere to the Company’s revenue model of deriving income from technology fees. This product is known as the Biotres and it addresses the shortcomings of existing solutions by adding connectivity, the ability to charge, and improved data through 3 channels, while maintaining patient convenience. The Biotres received FDA clearance in January 2022. The Company has commercialized and commenced selling of this product to its clinical customer base in April 2022.
 
The Company has also developed the Bioheart device, which is designed to be a personal Holter for consumers. This and other new technology that the Company is developing is applicable to the market segments that the Company intends to serve and will continue to adhere to the Company’s revenue model of deriving income from technology fees.
 
Competition
 
The medical technology equipment industry is characterized by strong competition and rapid technological change. There are a number of companies developing technologies that are competitive to our existing and proposed products, many of them, when compared to our Company, having significantly longer operational history and greater financial and other resources.
 
Within the US event monitoring systems market, we are aware of six main competitors in the MCT product segment. These competitors have increased market presence and distribution primarily by working through existing IDTFs. The existing competitors have maintained a competitive advantage within the market by controlling the distribution of all available MCT devices and software solutions. Our primary competitors in the MCT market are:
 
● Biotelemetry (formerly CardioNet), recently acquired by Philips for $2.8B. We believe that BioTelemetry, Inc. (NASDAQ:BEAT), has the largest network of IDTFs within the MCT market. BioTelemetry is considered a complete solution provider as it produces and distributes its own MCT device, software solution, and MCT monitoring centers. The company acquired its MCT device through the acquisition of a MCT manufacturer, Braemar. Upon acquisition of Braemar, BioTelemetry offered limited support to other clients utilizing Braemar’s technology. This resulted in BioTelemetry increasing the use of its device and software solution, enabling wide market penetration. We believe that BioTelemetry business model is focused on providing the MCT diagnostic service, as opposed to selling MCT solutions to other IDTFs or service providers, which enables a perpetual per-read fee as opposed to one time device or software sales. Equity research analysts categorize BioTelemetry as a clinical health provider, because of its business model, rather than as a medical device company. As such, we believe that BioTelemetry market cap is limited by the low multiples associated with that type of business, and, as a clinical health provider, BioTelemetry has significant overhead and fixed costs associated with monitoring centers and health professionals.
 
● Preventice (formerly eCardio.), recently acquired by Boston Scientific for $1.2B. Preventice is a private company, based in Houston, Texas. Preventice’s device is manufactured by a third party medical device company, TZ Medical. Preventice has integrated TZ Medical’s device with its software solution to create a complete MCT solution. Similar to Biotelemetry, we believe eCardio follows the same business model of offering the MCT service and acting as a clinical health provider.
 
● ScottCare. ScottCare is a private company in the US and a subsidiary of Scott Fetzer Company, a division of Berkshire Hathaway. ScottCare provides equipment for cardiovascular clinics and diagnostic technicians. ScottCare has built its own MCT device and software solution, and white-labeled TZ Medical’s device. Unlike the others, ScottCare offers its solution in an insourced model, where the physician has the opportunity to bill. This model requires the physician to purchase a minimum number of devices at an approximate average cost of $2,000 and their software at a cost of $25,000 to $40,000. After this initial upfront cost, ScottCare charges an additional per test fee for monitoring. We believe the above model creates a long return on investment for the physician. In our opinion, this has resulted in little market penetration for ScottCare as compared to the others.
 
● Infobionic. Infobionic is a private company located in Waltham, Massachusetts. It follows a leasing model where it leases it’s technology at a fixed monthly rate, whether technology is used or not. They have a complete solution, comprised of a device and software. We believe that they have a good model that will enable them to be competitive in the market. In our opinion, there is room for both Biotricity and Infobionic within the marketplace, though we believe that our solution is superior in two ways. Firstly, our device has a screen which allows better patient feedback and improved patient hookup at the clinic. Secondly, our business model is based on usage. The physician is charged a technology fee when the technology is used. If it is not used, there is no charge. This makes it attractive compared to Infobionic’s model where the physician is charged even if the technology is not used.

In addition, we note that:
 
● Medtronic. Medtronic is a major medical device conglomerate. It has an MCT solution by the name of SEEQ that was added to their portfolio through the acquisition of Corventis. We have seen no significant activity or usage with SEEQ in our market analysis. We also note that SEEQ is a patch based MCT solution that only collects data on 1 lead. As such, it has strong competition from 3 lead systems which are the standard for MCT. In early 2018, Medtronic withdrew SEEQ from the marketplace. We do not view Medtronic as a primary competitor, but, given the size and reach of Medtronic, they are an organization that we must continuously watch and be aware of.
 
● TZ Medical. TZ Medical is a medical device company that focuses on manufacturing a variety of medical devices. We do not consider TZ Medical to be a direct competitor as they produce an MCT device that is available for purchase, and sold to competitors such as to Scottcare and Preventice, described above. However, we do not believe that TZ Medical has a software solution, requiring any new entrant to either acquire or build out a software solution and then integrate that with the TZ Medical device. This creates a requirement for a large upfront capital investment. As a result, we believe this approach only works for organizations looking to become MCT solution providers with the same business model as the others.
 
We believe that our Bioflux MCT solution will successfully compete because:
 

● | it is designed as a platform to encompass all segments of the event monitoring market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | of the insourcing business model which we believe is applicable to a significantly larger portion of the total available market and enable more efficient strategic penetration and distribution; and 
● | for the other reasons described earlier under “–Market Opportunity.” 

Other Competition
 
As we commercialize our other products, such as Biotres, Bioheart, and Biocare, we will have additional competitors. We have listed some of the key names for each space and will expand this as we fully commercialize:
Biotres:
 

● | iRhythm Technologies: iRhythm is the leader in holter patch technology with the largest footprint. They are primarily hospital focused and operate as an IDTF, much like our MCT competitors. Their core product is the Zio patch, which is a 1 channel holter with no connectivity and is not rechargeable

In the digital health space, we have noticed that we have competitors for different products but not a single competitor that has the entire product portfolio that we have. This adds a layer of differentiation and competitive advantage as customer can deal with one vendor as opposed to multiple vendors that they have to integrate.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We primarily rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.
 
Because of customer needs that exceeded the capabilities of the third party software we were initially intending to use, we independently developed our own ECG reporting software.
 
We have and generally plan to continue to enter into non-disclosure, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we intend to also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, suppliers and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
We also may from time to time rely on other intellectual property developed or acquired, including patents, technical innovations, laws of unfair competition and various other licensing agreements to provide our future growth and to build our competitive position. We have filed an industrial design patent in Canada, and we may decide to file for additional patents as we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent or other rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right. We fully intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property and patents.
 
Currently, we have a number of registered trademarks; we may obtain additional registrations in the future.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development programs are generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us in California and Toronto on a full-time basis or hired as per diem consultants or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies. In all cases, we ensure that all areas of IP are owned and controlled by the Company.
 
The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such products.
 
We incurred research and development costs of $2.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and $2.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
 
Government Regulation
 
General
 
Our medical device products are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products.


In addition to those indicated below, the only other regulations we encounter are regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We will also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our products, if and when developed for commercial use. It may become the case that other regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.
 
U.S. Regulation
 
The FDA governs the following activities that Biotricity performs, will perform, upon the clearance or approval of its product candidates, or that are performed on its behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:
 

● | product design, and development; 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | product safety, testing, labeling and storage; 
● | record keeping procedures; and 
● | product marketing. 

 
There are numerous FDA regulatory requirements governing the approval or clearance and subsequent commercial marketing of Biotricity’s products. These include:
 

● | the timely submission of product listing and establishment registration information, along with associated establishment user fees; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | continued compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which require specification developers and manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 


11
--


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that would constitute a major change in intended use; 
● | Medical Device Reporting regulations (MDR), which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 
● | adequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same; 
● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and 
● | notices of correction or removal and recall regulations. 

 
Depending on the classification of the device, before Biotricity can commercially distribute medical devices in the United States, it had to obtain, either prior 510(k) clearance, 510(k) de-novo clearance or premarket approval (PMA), from the FDA unless a respective exemption applied. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness:
 

● | Class I devices, which are low risk and subject to only general controls (e.g., registration and listing, medical device labeling compliance, MDRs, Quality System Regulations, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding) and, in some cases, to the 510(k) premarket clearance requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II devices, which are moderate risk and generally require 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the United States as well as general controls and potentially special controls like performance standards or specific labeling requirements; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III devices, which are devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Class III devices generally require the submission and approval of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The custom software and hardware of our products are classified as Class II. Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls. Special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient histories and FDA guidance documents. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is generally accomplished through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket notification process. As part of the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo notification process, the FDA may have required the following:
 

● | Development of comprehensive product description and indications for use. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completion of extensive preclinical tests and preclinical animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. 
● | Comprehensive review of predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to one or more predicate devices. 
● | If appropriate and required, certain types of clinical trials (IDE submission and approval may be required for conducting a clinical trial in the US).

If required, clinical trials involve use of the medical device on human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent for their participation in the clinical study. A written protocol with predefined end points, an appropriate sample size and pre-determined patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, is required before initiating and conducting a clinical trial. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations that among other things, govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but it must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.


Given successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) premarket notification or 510(k) de-novo was submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. The notification included all relevant data from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation.
 
A 510(k) clearance letter from the FDA then authorized commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications of use.
 
After 510(k) clearance, Biotricity is required to comply with a number of post-clearance requirements, including, but not limited to, Medical Device Reporting and complaint handling, and, if applicable, reporting of corrective actions. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to QSRs. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with QSRs, which impose extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements on medical device manufacturers. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the change, validation activities may need to be performed. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs and other types of regulatory controls.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance from FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use or technological characteristics, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until additional 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
 
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, will also regulate the advertising claims of Biotricity’s products to ensure that the claims it makes are consistent with its regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that product advertising is neither false nor misleading.

We received 510(k) clearance for both the software and hardware components of our Bioflux product. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a notification to the FDA demonstrating that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device (i.e., a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or Class II, or a 510(k)-cleared device). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted but also can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Once the information is submitted, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant a company 510(k) clearance for its pipeline products, and failure to obtain the necessary clearances for its products would adversely affect its ability to grow its business. Delays in receipt or failure to receive the necessary clearances, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements, could reduce its business prospects.
 
Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk may be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo process. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, or FDAMA added the de novo classification pathway now codified in section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. This law established an alternate pathway to classify new devices into Class I or II that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a Not Substantially Equivalent, or NSE, determination in response to a 510(k) submission. Through this regulatory process, a sponsor who receives an NSE determination may, within 30 days of receipt, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device through what is called a “de novo request.” In 2012, section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), in order to provide a second option for de novo classification. Under this second pathway, a sponsor who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence can submit a de novo request to FDA without first submitting a 510(k).
 
In the event that a company receives a Not Substantially Equivalent determination for its candidates in response to a 510(k) submission, the device may still be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo classification process.
 
Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo classification process require the submission of a PMA. The PMA process is much more time consuming and demanding than the 510(k) notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from preclinical and/or clinical studies and data relating to manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA’s in-depth review of the information generally takes between one and three years and may take significantly longer. If the FDA does not grant 510(k) clearance to its future products, there is no guarantee that Biotricity will submit a PMA or that if it does, that the FDA would grant a PMA approval of Biotricity’s future products, either of which would adversely affect Biotricity’s business.
 
We also need to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We plan to do this in compliance with the internationally recognized standard ISO 13485:2013 Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems – Requirements for Regulatory Purposes. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Until recently, we have focused primarily on research and development of the first generation version of the Bioflux. We have now completed the development of Biotres and of Bioheart and their proposed marketing and distribution, but are not yet at a stage to commence volume production of either. We currently assemble our devices at our Redwood City, California facility. In order to maintain compliance with FDA and other regulatory requirements, our manufacturing facilities must be periodically re-evaluated and qualified under a quality system to ensure they meet production and quality standards. Suppliers of components and products used to manufacture our devices must also comply with FDA regulatory requirements, which often require significant resources and subject us and our suppliers to potential regulatory inspections and stoppages.
 
We have a scalable manufacturing strategy and goals and use Providence Enterprises (herein “Providence”), which is an FDA qualified manufacturer for contract manufacturing. We do not have a contract with Providence or any obligation to use them (nor do they have any obligations with respect to us other than with respect to any specific orders we may make) and we enter into purchase orders for each manufacturing request we have with Providence, as we would with other vendors. Despite our working relationship with Providence, we intend to continue to identify and develop other efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and options to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass market our products, especially at the low-cost levels we require to facilitate our business plan.
 
We currently rely on a number of principal suppliers for the components that make up our products and proposed products; these include Digikey Corporation and Mouser Electronics for electronics and connectors, Telit/Stollmann for Bluetooth modules, Yongan Innovations for batteries, Dongguan Bole RP&M Cp. Ltd. for plastics, Unimed Medical and Conmed for ECG cables and electrodes, and Medico Systems for touch-panel LCD displays. We believe that the raw materials used or expected to be used in our planned products can be acquired from multiple sources and are readily available on the market.
 
Employees
 
We currently have 44 full-time employees and approximately 20 consultants who are based in our offices located in Silicon Valley, California and Toronto, Canada. These employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company and, together with the consultants, support management, engineering, manufacturing, and administration. We have no unionized employees.
 
We plan to hire more than 20 additional full-time employees within the next 12 months, as needed to support continued growth in our business. Their principal responsibilities will be the support of our sales, marketing, research and development, and clinical development activities.
 
We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
