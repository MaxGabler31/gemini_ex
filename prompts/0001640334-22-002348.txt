Corporate History and Structure

Verde Resources, Inc. was incorporated on April 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. 

The following persons were appointed to serve as directors and to assume the responsibilities of officers on October 17, 2013. Mr. Wu Ming Ding, as President and Director; Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu as Treasurer Chief Financial Officer, General Manager and Director; and Mr. Liang Wai Keen as Secretary.

On October 25, 2013, we entered into an Assignment Agreement For the Assignment of Management Right in Merapoh Gold Mines in Malaysia (“Assignment Agreement”) with Federal Mining Resources Limited (“FMR”), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.

FMR owned 85% equity interest in CSB, a private limited liability company incorporated in Malaysia. CSB is the Mining Contractor of the Mining Lease for Site IV-1 at the Merapoh Gold Mine under the Contract for Work with MMC Corporation Berhad, the Permit Holder of the Mining Lease.

Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, FMR had assigned its management rights of CSB’s mining operation in the Mining Lease to the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Gold Billion Global Limited (“GBL”), in exchange for 80,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which constituted 95.26% of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of and immediately after the consummation of the acquisition.

GBL was formed on February 7, 2013, by the Board of Directors of FMR to monitor the CSB operation. The acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of GBL was agreed upon on October 18, 2013, and completed on October 25, 2013, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and the audit of GBL.

Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement For The Assignment of Management Right in Merapoh Gold Mines in Malaysia (“Assignment Agreement”) dated October 25, 2013, and a Supplementary Agreement dated February 17, 2014 on further clarifications to the Assignment Agreement signed by the Company with Federal Mining Resources Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“FMR”), the 100% interest of FMR in GBL was transferred to VRDR at a consideration of $1. This transaction was recorded as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-40 “Reverse Acquisitions”. The legal parent was VRDR, which was the accounting acquiree, while GBL was the accounting acquirer. There was a 15% non-controlling interest of CSB after the acquisition. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein GBL with its 85% deemed subsidiary CSB was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.

Prior to the acquisition of GBL, on July 1, 2013, FMR had assigned its rights and obligations pursuant to its 85% interest in Champmark Sdn Bhd (“CSB”) to GBL. According to ASC 810-05-08 A, CSB is a deemed subsidiary of GBL because due to the assignment, GBL had gained control of the Board of Directors of CSB, GBL’s rights to receive future benefits and residual value, and GBL’s obligation to absorb losses and provide financing for CSB. GBL had the power to direct the activities of CSB that most significantly impact CSB’s economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of CSB that could potentially be significant to CSB. Accordingly, GBL was the primary beneficiary of CSB. Under 810-23-42, 43, it was determined that CSB was de-facto agent and GBL, the principal, and consequently, CSB was considered as a deemed subsidiary of GBL beginning July 1, 2013.

Stage of Operation

The Company has negotiated with Malaysia state agency PKNP on a 2-year lease for a new mining location that is about 5 km from the current Merapoh mine site. The leasing premium has been paid but the mining lease certificate will only be issued upon clearance from the Malaysia Forest Department, which is expected in mid 2023 subject to review on COVID-19 “Movement Control Order” by the Malaysian government.

For the current Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine, our mining operation would focus on mining other resources such as limestones.

The Company believes that there are excellent growth opportunities for its business outside Malaysia. We periodically examine potential acquisitions of mining projects in other parts of the world.

As our business is affected by the fluctuations of gold prices, the Company may diversify its holdings by acquiring mining projects with potential for different mineral resources other than gold. We may look to other mining companies for potential collaboration to carry out exploration and exploitation works on other mineral resources in Southeast Asia regions. Apart from the mining industry, the Company has taken steps to look into investment opportunities in the non-mining areas that include the bioenergy industry and the food & beverage sector.

The Company is diversifying into the green industry with its acquisition of Bio Resources Ltd (“BRL”), the beneficial and/or registered proprietor of the intellectual property known as “Catalytic Biofraction Process”, which is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerise palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degree Celsius to 500 degree Celsius to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like the palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock. The success of venturing into the green industry is dependent on the completion of the acquisition subject to auditing and due diligence exercise to ascertain the valuation of BRL.

Apart from the green industry, the Company is also working on a partnership with MRX Technologies, a market leader in commercial extraction systems for cannabis and hemp. The partnership includes an agreement for Verde Resources to white-label THC-free CBD products from MRX Technologies.

Regional Geology:

The Malaysia Central Gold Belt runs along the entire backbone of Peninsular Malaysia, extending further to the north. It was formed between the Sibumasu block in the west and Manabor block in the east that runs along major mineral deposits in Thailand, Myanmar and China. The regional gold deposits were made of Epithermal deposits that formed in a series of volcanic environment, where the tensional fractures along the subduction zone allows the intrusion of mineral rich acidic magma within deep faults.
Rock Formations and Mineralization:

Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine covers an area of 400 acres with mineralization structure being Permian limestone dominating the South-East portion, felsic volcanic tuff in the Western portion of the area and intrusive dacite rock to the north-west of the area. Tectonic contact within the sheer zone of creates epithermal mineralization, forming a mineral rich vein along the contact zone. The mineralized zone is made of highly altered tuffacaous rock with abundant pyrite dissemination and a moderately spaced quartz vein.
Work Completed and Present Condition:

Lode gold exploration on Site IV-1 of Merapoh Gold Mine has commenced since 2011 and still in progress with both in-house drilling team and third party drilling services running in parallel to expedite data collection to generate a comprehensive JORC compliant gold reserve report. There was no gold ore extraction since 2019 and the company has been engaged on the sales of wash sand extracted from Site IV-1 of Merapoh Gold Mine to customers in Malaysia from January 2021 to September 2021.

Description of Processing Facilities:


Process for removing ore concentrates from the ore body


1. | The ore body is transported to the treatment plants in vehicles capable of hauling huge, heavy loads. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The ore body is separated into Ore Type 1 Stockpile and Ore Type 2 Stockpile. 
3. | The monitor washes finer gold bearing material off larger rocks which is screened on an inclined coarse wire screen.
4. | An excavator is used to turn over the rocks so wash is removed from all sides of the coarse material. 
5. | A monitor pushes the rock down the inclined coarse screen where the course is removed and stockpiled at the bottom. 
6. | Finer material passes through the mesh screen into the sluice system and runs over the sluice. 
7. | The carpets are removed and taken to refining facility for gold recovery. 
8. | A suction pipe recovers water of the fine tailings pond for use in the system. 


Refining of the concentrate


1. | The carpets holding concentrate from the sluice are brought to a shed in the camp site where the gold is refined. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The first stage of the refining is to wash the gold containing concentrate into large bins. This is pumped to a jig and shaking table. 
3. | Nuggets are handpicked from the coarse fraction and the fine fraction is amalgamated to remove the gold. After distillation, gold from the amalgam and the coarse are melted with flux and the gold is poured into small bars.

Current State of Exploration:

As of the date of this report, the Merapoh Gold Mine property is without known reserves.

The Merapoh Gold Mine commenced exploratory operation in alluvia mining and achieved its first gold pour in July 2011. Through the years of operation, the Company has performed ongoing exercises to improve upon the matching of processing method with the types of ore in order to optimize cost to recovery ratio. In July 2013, production was outsourced to a reputable subcontractor, and developed a resource management system to match ore against processes to achieve the most cost efficient and highest recovery production procedure.

There was no gold ore extraction of the Merapoh Gold Mine and no gold concentrate sold for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. We have generated other income from the sales of wash sand to customers in Malaysia.

Our revenues have been derived from gold production from the Merapoh Gold Mine, but currently there is no production from that mine and we are not certain there will be production in the future. We have generated other revenues through seeking new customers of wash sand sales during January to September 2021. Management continues to search for mining opportunities to generate revenues in the future.

Subcontractors

In an effort to enhance the efficiency of mine operations at the Merapoh Gold Mine, Champmark Sdn Bhd (“CSB”) entered into an Operation Term Sheet (“OTS”) agreement in July 2013 to outsource the exploitation works of alluvial gold resources at Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine to a subcontractor Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd (“BOG”).  Throughout the financial years 2022 and 2021, BOG was a related party via its holding company Borneo Oil Berhad, a substantial shareholder of the Company.

BOG has the experience and local knowledge in managing the exploitation of alluvial gold at the Merapoh Gold Mine. The Company currently intends to continue to outsource the exploitation of alluvial gold at our mine site to BOG and will provide necessary disclosure when any significant agreements have been made with the sub-contractor in the future.

In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.

Malaysia has not yet enacted regulations specifically for pyrolysis systems.  The Company using a pyrolysis system will operate in designated industrial zones and maintain valid operating and trading licenses that may include Environmental Impact Assessments, and inspections by Malaysian government agencies for health & safety such as Bomba.

Insurance

Insurance companies in Malaysia offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in Malaysia, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we could face liability from the interruption of our business as summarized under “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We do not carry business interruption insurance so we could incur unrecoverable losses if our business is interrupted.
