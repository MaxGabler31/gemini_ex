ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 
Argan, Inc. (Argan) conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (GPS), Atlantic Projects Company Limited and affiliates (APC), The Roberts Company, Inc. (TRC) and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (SMC) (together referred to as the Company, we, us, or our). Through GPS and APC, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including independent power project owners, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. GPS, including its consolidated joint ventures, and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern United States and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers and piping systems. Through SMC, now conducting business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region.
 
Holding Company Structure
 
Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 1961. We intend to make additional opportunistic acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that companies acquired in each of these industrial groups will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding company with no operations other than its continuing investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC.
Power Industry Services
 
Our power industry services are performed substantially by GPS which is a full service engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor with the proven abilities of designing, building and commissioning large-scale energy projects in the United States. During this past year, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of its founding. The extensive design, construction, project management, start-up and operating experience of GPS has grown with installed and under-contract capacity for nearly 15,000 MW of mostly domestic power-generating capacity including 65 gas turbines comprising 44 projects. Our power projects have included base-load combined-cycle facilities, simple-cycle peaking plants and boiler plant construction and renovation efforts. We also have experience in the renewable energy industry by providing EPC contracting and other services to the owners of alternative energy facilities, including biomass plants, wind farms and solar fields. Typically, the scope of work for GPS includes complete plant engineering and design, the procurement of equipment and construction from site development through electrical interconnection and plant testing. The durations of our construction projects may extend to three years. In the most recent construction firm rankings published in May 2017 by Engineering News-Record (ENR), GPS was ranked the 12th largest power industry construction contractor and the 40th largest design-build firm in the United States.
 
This reportable business segment also includes APC, a company formed in Dublin, Ireland, over 40 years ago, and its affiliated companies, which we acquired in May 2015 for approximately $8.8 million in consideration, net of cash acquired. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment installation, commissioning and outage services to original equipment manufacturers, global construction firms and plant owners worldwide. APC has successfully completed projects in more than 30 countries on six continents. With its presence in Ireland and its other offices located in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and New York, APC expanded our operations internationally for the first time. The operating results of APC have been included in our consolidated operating results since the date of its acquisition.
 
The revenues of our power industry services business segment were $815 million, $587 million and $388 million for the years ended January 31, 2018 (Fiscal 2018), 2017 (Fiscal 2017) and 2016 (Fiscal 2016), respectively, or 91%, 87% and 94% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. During Fiscal 2018, we saw the continued performance of EPC services for four natural gas-fired power plant projects, the start of EPC services for two natural gas-fired power plant projects and the start of a contract for the erection of a biomass boiler, a critical component of a new power plant being constructed in Teesside, England.

(1)         Full Notice to Proceed (FNTP) represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence the activities covered by the corresponding contract.
 (2)         Project values added to project backlog during Fiscal 2018.
 
During Fiscal 2017, we completed two natural gas-fired combined cycled power plant projects for affiliates of Panda Power Funds (Panda). Both plants are located in Pennsylvania with each one providing 829 MW of electrical power.
 
Project Backlog
 
Project backlog represents the total value of projects awarded less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts at a specific point in time. We believe project backlog can be an indicator of future revenues and earnings potential as it reflects business that we consider to be firm. However, cancellations or reductions may occur that could reduce backlog and our expected future revenues. At January 31, 2018, the project backlog for this reporting segment was approximately $355 million. The comparable backlog amount as of January 31, 2017 was approximately $1.0 billion. Despite the new awards that are identified above, the value of this reporting segments project backlog has declined by 64% during the current year which substantially reflects the amounts of revenues earned by GPS due to performance on its active projects. New opportunities have been pursued and negotiations continue for several projects.
 
On March 27, 2018, we announced that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with NTE Carolinas II, LLC, an affiliate of NTE Energy (NTE), to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant in Rockingham County, North Carolina, with a project value of approximately $250 million. NTE, through its affiliates, develops and acquires strategically located electric generation and transmission facilities within North America. The NTE Reidsville Energy Center is similar to two EPC services projects currently being completed by GPS for NTE; the Kings Mountain Energy Center in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and the Middletown Energy Center in Middletown, Ohio. Both of these projects are scheduled to be completed in 2018. We expect to add the value of this new work to project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018.
 
Project Development Participation
 
We opportunistically participate in developmental and related financing activities 1) to develop a proprietary pipeline for future EPC activities, 2) to secure exclusive rights to EPC contracts, and 3) to generate profits through interest and success fees. We partnered with Moxie Energy, LLC (Moxie) to take principal positions in the initial stages of development for three projects in the Marcellus Shale Region. All three developmental efforts were successfully completed resulting in GPS securing the rights for EPC contracts for large scale natural gas-fired power plants (including the two plants built for Panda). Success fees received related to these three projects and recognized in our consolidated financial statements in prior fiscal years totaled $31.3 million. Currently, we are participating in developmental and related financing activities with several developers.
Joint Ventures
 
EPC contractors in our industry periodically execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project or program for a project owner. These special purpose entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. Accordingly, GPS assigned the EPC contracts for the Panda Liberty Power Project (Panda Liberty) and the Panda Patriot Power Project (Panda Patriot) to joint ventures to perform the work for the applicable project and to spread the bonding risk associated with each project. Our partner for both ventures is the same large, heavy civil contracting firm. The joint venture agreements provide that GPS has the majority interest in any profits, losses, assets and liabilities that result from the performance of these EPC contracts for the projects. However, if the joint venture partner is unable to pay its share of any losses that may arise in the future, GPS would be fully liable. GPS has no significant remaining commitments beyond those related to the provision of

warranty services under the EPC contracts for the completed Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot projects. The joint venture partners dedicated resources to the projects that were necessary to complete the power plants; they have been reimbursed for their costs. GPS has performed most of the activities pursuant to these EPC contracts. Due to our financial control over the joint ventures, they are included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. None of the current large power plant projects listed above involve a joint venture.
 
Materials
 
In connection with the engineering and construction of traditional power plants, biodiesel plants and other renewable energy systems, we procure materials for installation on the various projects. With our assistance, the project owners frequently procure and supply certain major components of the power plants such as the natural gas-fired combustion turbines. We are not dependent upon any one source for materials that we use to complete a particular project, and we are not currently experiencing difficulties in procuring the necessary materials for our contracted projects. However, we cannot guarantee that in the future there will not be unscheduled delays in the delivery of materials and equipment ordered by us or a project owner.
Competition
 
We compete with numerous large and well capitalized private and public firms in the construction and engineering services industry. These competitors include Bechtel Corporation, Fluor Corporation and Black & Veatch, global firms providing engineering, procurement, construction and project management services; SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., a diversified Canadian construction and engineering firm; Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., a diversified firm providing consulting, engineering, construction and facilities management services; and Kiewit Corporation, an employee-owned global construction firm. These and other competitors are multi-billion dollar companies with thousands of employees. We also may compete with regional construction services companies in the markets where planned projects might be located.
 
To compete with these firms, we emphasize our proven track record as a cost-effective choice for the design, build and commissioning of natural gas-fired and alternative energy power systems. Our extensive and successful experience includes the efficient completion of natural gas-fired simple cycle and combined cycle power plants, wood/coal-fired plants, waste-to-energy plants, wind farms, solar fields and biofuel processing facilities, all performed on an EPC contract basis. Through the power industry services segment, we provide a full range of competitively priced development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management and maintenance services to project owners. We are able to react quickly to their requirements while bringing a strong, experienced team to help navigate through difficult technical, scheduling and construction issues.
 
Customers
 
For Fiscal 2018, the Companys most significant power industry service customers were NTE Ohio LLC; CPV Towantic, LLC; Moxie Freedom LLC and NTE Carolinas LLC, which together represented 84% of consolidated revenues for the year. Each of these projects accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018.
 
For Fiscal 2017, the Companys most significant power industry service customers were NTE Ohio LLC; CPV Towantic, LLC; Moxie Freedom LLC; NTE Carolinas LLC and Panda Patriot LLC, which together represented 79% of consolidated revenues for the year. Each of these projects accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017.
 
For Fiscal 2016, we recognized revenues associated with EPC services provided to Panda Patriot LLC and Panda Liberty LLC, the owners of the two completed projects, Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot, which represented approximately 73% of consolidated revenues in the aggregate.
 
Regulation
 
Our power industry service operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement, employee compensation and security clearance requirements. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Industrial Fabrication and Field Services
 
On December 4, 2015, we acquired TRC, which was founded in 1977 and is headquartered near Greenville, North Carolina.  TRC is principally an industrial steel fabricator and field services provider for both light and heavy industrial organizations primarily in the southern region of the United States. We paid $0.5 million to acquire the member interests of TRC, and assumed approximately $15.6 million in debt obligations which we paid off on the acquisition date.  TRC continues to operate under its own name with its own management team. Historically, TRC was a profitable company that incurred a net loss in 2015 up to the date of its acquisition by us, primarily due to it taking on large contracts that resulted in significant losses. With the reengagement and leadership of TRCs founder, John Roberts, our financial support and the substantial completion of these loss contracts, we acquired TRC with the belief that it is positioned to succeed in the future with a return to profitable operations. However, there can be no assurances that TRC will succeed in the future or will resume sustained profitability. Since the acquisition, we advanced an additional $22.5 million in cash to TRC in order to fund the completion of the work on the loss contracts, to enhance working capital and for other general corporate purposes. No advances have been made to TRC since March 2016.
 
Currently, TRC operates as its own reportable business segment, industrial fabrication and field services. TRCs major customers include some of North Americas largest forest products companies, such as International Paper and Domtar, power companies, such as Duke Energy and Husky Energy, large fertilizer companies, such as Nutrien Ltd. (formerly Potash Corp.), mining and petrochemical companies. For Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, this reporting segment generated revenues of $65.3 million, $79.0 million and $15.3 million (a partial year), respectively.
 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
 
SMC represents our telecommunications infrastructure services reportable business segment and conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, which provides comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to customers in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We perform both outside plant and inside plant cabling. The revenues of SMC were $13.0 million, $9.4 million and $10.4 million for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or approximately 1%, 1% and 2% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
 
Services provided to our outside premises customers include trench-less directional boring and excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor lighting systems. The outside premises services are primarily provided to state and local government agencies, regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial customers.
 
The wide range of inside premises wiring services that we provide to our customers include the structuring, cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the physical transport for high speed data, voice, video and security networks. These services are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities.
 
Consistently, a major portion of SMCs revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with SMCs major customers. Over the last three years, these major customers have included the city of Westminster, Maryland; the Maryland Transit Administration and other state agencies, counties and municipalities located in Maryland; DXC Technology Company, formed by the combination of Computer Sciences Corporation and the enterprise services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; and Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, a local electricity cooperative.
 
SMC operates in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services industry. We compete with service providers ranging from small regional companies, which service a single market, to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in the telecommunication and utility infrastructure services industry. We intend to emphasize our high quality reputation, outstanding customer base and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts.

Financing Arrangements
 
We have financing arrangements with Bank of America (the Bank) that are described in an Amended Replacement Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), dated May 15, 2017, which superseded our prior arrangements with the Bank. The Credit Agreement provides a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $50.0 million that is available until May 31, 2021 with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.00%. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover other credit instruments issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. We have approximately $18.9 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings.
 
We have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Banks consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank requires that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each of our fiscal quarter-ends. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. As of January 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We believe we will continue to comply with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
 
Safety, Risk Management, Insurance and Performance Bonds
 
We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits.  GPS, APC, TRC and SMC each have an experienced full time safety director committed to ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable permits, insurance and local and environmental laws. Contracts with customers in each of our reportable business segments may require performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. Under such circumstances and/or as a means to spread project risk, we may consider an arrangement with a joint venture party in order to provide the required bonding to a prospective project owner (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). We maintain material amounts of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet, and, as indicated above, we have the commitment of the Bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million in support of our bonding collateral requirements. As of January 31, 2018, we had approximately $153 million in bonded project backlog related to GPS. Not all of our projects require bonding.
Employees
 
The total number of personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and the relative amount of work performed by subcontractors. We had approximately 1,552 employees at January 31, 2018, substantially all of whom were full-time. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
