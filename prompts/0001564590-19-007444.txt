Overview
 As used in this Form 10-K, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company” refer to Insys Therapeutics, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative drugs and novel drug delivery systems of therapeutic molecules that improve patients’ quality of life. We have two marketed products: SUBSYS®, a proprietary sublingual fentanyl spray indicated for the management of BTCP patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain; and SYNDROS®, a proprietary, orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments and anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. As discussed below, on November 5, 2018, we announced a process to review strategic alternatives for our opioid-related assets including SUBSYS®.  The Company has also engaged Lazard Freres & Co. LLC to advise the Company on capital planning and the evaluation of strategic alternatives. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic licensing and partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments.
 Insys Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in June 1990, and maintains headquarters in Chandler, Arizona.  
 For further detail concerning our Company and communities, see the “Available Information” section included in this Item 1. 
 SUBSYS®
 SUBSYS® is a proprietary, single-use product that delivers fentanyl, an opioid analgesic, for transmucosal absorption underneath the tongue. We filed our NDA in March 2011 and received marketing approval for SUBSYS® from the FDA in January 2012 for the treatment of BTCP. BTCP is characterized by sudden, often unpredictable, episodes of pain that can peak in severity at less than one minute to 10 minutes despite background pain controlled by around-the-clock medication. We believe SUBSYS® is an important, differentiated treatment option for patients and physicians relative to other TIRF products due to its rapid onset of action, improved bioavailability, most complete range of dosage strengths and ease of administration. Our product label includes data from our pivotal clinical trial demonstrating that SUBSYS® may provide pain relief in as little as five minutes, which represents the most rapid onset of action in the TIRF class of products. Also, in a head-to-head study, SUBSYS® demonstrated 76% bioavailability versus 51% for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s ACTIQ®. Further, SUBSYS® offers the most complete range of dosage strengths in the TIRF class of products, consisting of 100 to 1,600 microgram, or mcg, doses. Patients can administer SUBSYS® in less than one minute while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s ACTIQ® and FENTORA®, the leading branded TIRF products, can require 15 to 30 minutes to administer. 
 We launched SUBSYS® as a commercial product in March 2012. Upon launch, SUBSYS® was the fourth new branded product in the TIRF market over the prior five years. Within the first four weeks of product launch, SUBSYS® realized greater market share than the previous three branded products combined at their respective peak market penetration levels according to Source Healthcare Analytics. In December 2018, SUBSYS® was the most prescribed branded TIRF product, with approximately 24% market share on a prescription basis according to IQVIA. Approximately 900 physicians were responsible for 90% of all TIRF prescriptions dispensed in 2018, according to IQVIA. As a result, our commercial organization has been able to promote SUBSYS® using a highly targeted approach designed to maximize impact with physicians who are TIRF REMS enrolled. In addition, our commercial organization continues to specifically target oncology healthcare providers and practices.
 SUBSYS® utilizes our proprietary sublingual spray technology consisting of a small, single-unit device that delivers our proprietary formulation of drug particles via a fine mist disbursed across a broad surface area of the highly permeable membrane underneath the tongue. This delivery platform is suitable for other molecules for which 
 1



there may be a benefit to a greater rate and extent of absorption, which could lead to a more rapid onset of action and enhanced bioavailability versus other oral preparations and routes of administration. We are developing our proprietary sublingual spray technology in other product applications in order to expand our portfolio of product candidates.
 SYNDROS®
 SYNDROS®, a proprietary, orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol, has demonstrated rapidly detectable blood levels and a reliable absorption profile in our clinical studies. In 2012, we completed a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and a pivotal bioequivalence study. Our pivotal bioequivalence study measured the PK of SYNDROS® versus Marinol®. This PK study demonstrated that 100% of subjects receiving SYNDROS® achieved detectable plasma levels at 15 minutes compared to less than 25% of subjects receiving Marinol®. In this study, SYNDROS® also demonstrated a 44% decrease in the patient coefficient of variation for area under the curve, or AUC, which is indicative of greater patient exposure to drug after administration. We received FDA approval for SYNDROS® in July 2016. In March 2017, the DEA issued an interim final ruling that resulted in SYNDROS® being placed in Schedule II of the CSA.  The final labeling reflecting the scheduling was approved by the FDA in May 2017 and we commercially launched SYNDROS® in July 2017.
Other Products
 We are leveraging our capabilities in cannabinoid formulation and manufacturing, as well as our sublingual and nasal spray drug delivery technology, to develop a portfolio of differentiated, wholly-owned product candidates. Our most advanced product candidate is a naloxone nasal spray. This product candidate possesses unique pharmacological properties that may make it effective in treating overdose due to illicitly manufactured fentanyl and other long-lasting opioid drug products. We plan to file an NDA for this product candidate with the FDA in the second quarter of 2019.  We are also leveraging our spray technology to develop an epinephrine nasal spray for the treatment of anaphylaxis.  This novel formulation and dosage form the potential to replace intramuscular injections.  Additionally, we continue to progress with our Cannabidiol Oral Solution, a CBD, and currently have three clinical development programs underway, including two Phase 2 and one Phase 3 clinical trials.
Strategy
 Strategic alternatives.  On November 5, 2018, we announced that we commenced a process to review strategic alternatives for our portfolio of opioid-related assets, including SUBSYS®, as well as formulations of buprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine/naloxone. Our decision to pursue this process is consistent with our ongoing negotiations in connection with the agreement in principle related to the DOJ Investigation, wherein we expect the OIG to require us to exit the opioid business within 12 months of executing the final settlement agreements.  See Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these legal matters. Furthermore, this dovetails with our strategy to become a leader in pharmaceutical cannabinoids and novel drug delivery systems and to continue shifting our focus away from opioids in our product pipeline. We anticipate that our Company has a number of clinical and regulatory milestones to achieve over the next few quarters, including the completion of the CBD and epinephrine studies and filing the naloxone NDA, that are consistent with our objectives.  Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic licensing and partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments.
 Advance our synthetic cannabinoid product pipeline.   Clinical trials with CBD in epilepsy and Prader-Willi Syndrome continue to progress with the results from two trials expected in 2019.  We have conducted a pharmacokinetic trial with a proprietary inhaled formulation of dronabinol and are planning our next steps in the product candidate’s development. 
 SUBSYS® market share and revenues.   We launched SUBSYS® as a commercial product in March 2012. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 4,500 physicians enrolled in the TIRF REMS program. Enrollment in this class-wide REMS program is required by the FDA in order to prescribe TIRF products. Approximately 900 physicians comprise 90% of TIRF prescriptions dispensed in 2018, according to IQVIA. Our sales and marketing 
 2



efforts have primarily targeted approximately 48% of these top 900 prescribing physicians with a focus on those prescribers with the highest number of BTCP patients.
 Continue to optimize our commercial organization to market SUBSYS®, SYNDROS®, and potential pipeline products.   We commercialize SUBSYS® through our commercial sales organization. We also market SYNDROS® and will market other proprietary supportive care products, if approved, using this same commercial sales organization. We may also utilize our commercial organization or third parties to market our pipeline products, once approved.
 Research and develop additional sublingual and nasal spray product candidates.   We believe that the delivery of certain pharmaceutical products using our sublingual or nasal spray platform technologies could have significant advantages over other methods of delivery. Our sublingual and nasal spray technologies deliver drug product directly to the sublingual or nasal mucosa, respectively, for rapid and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. This process is accomplished by delivering a ready-to-be absorbed formulation across either the sublingual or nasal mucosa. The sublingual mucosa is an efficient medium for the delivery of certain drugs because this membrane is highly permeable with a high density of blood vessels, which allows for the portion of the drug absorbed to bypass first-pass metabolism in the liver. Similarly, nasal administration of select drug products can result in the same benefits as sublingual administration.  Certain drug products delivered utilizing our sublingual and nasal spray technologies can be absorbed quickly and take effect more rapidly than many other forms of administration. We are developing several product candidates, including buprenorphine, buprenorphine with naloxone, naloxone, epinephrine and rizatriptan, where we believe our proprietary sublingual and nasal spray technologies have the potential to provide a clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage over existing delivery methods.
 Use our core competencies and expertise to expand our dronabinol and cannabidiol manufacturing capabilities.   Because dronabinol is difficult to import, procure and produce, we have a U.S.-based, state-of-the-art dronabinol manufacturing facility, which was able to supply the API for initial launch quantities of SYNDROS®. Further, we have the ability to manufacture pure, synthetic cannabidiol at this DEA-approved and FDA-inspected manufacturing facility located in Round Rock, TX. In 2014, we completed construction of a second manufacturing facility that enables us to supply sufficient commercial quantities of dronabinol API for the commercialization of our proprietary synthetic cannabinoid product candidates.

SUBSYS® -Sublingual Fentanyl Spray
 SUBSYS® is a proprietary, single-use product developed for the management of BTCP patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain through the delivery of a liquid fentanyl formulation in 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1,200 and 1,600 mcg dosages. The 1,200 and 1,600 mcg doses of SUBSYS® are achieved by administering two 600 and 800 mcg doses, respectively. The mechanism by which the liquid is delivered is a highly consistent, one-step process in which a plume of fentanyl is generated by the actuation of the device. The plume disperses a small volume of liquid across the surface area of the sublingual mucosa and facilitates rapid absorption by the body. 
Cancer Pain Market Overview
 Cancer pain can occur as a result of tumors pressing on nerves, damage caused by cancer cells in bone and treatments for cancer such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery. Many cancer patients experiencing pain suffer from two types of pain: (1) persistent or continuous pain, which is typically managed by long-acting or sustained-release drugs taken by patients on a regular schedule, and (2) breakthrough pain, which can be severe and sudden, and may require a stronger, fast-acting medication. Opioids are the most widely-prescribed treatment for cancer pain followed by medications commonly used to treat inflammatory pain, such as corticosteroids, anesthetics, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants and antidepressants.
 5



Following rapid onset that peaks at less than one minute to 10 minutes, BTCP episodes can last several minutes to an hour, and usually occur several times per day. Pain is a widely prevalent condition of cancer patients, approximately 60% of cancer patients with persistent pain may experience BTCP, which is particularly difficult to treat due to its severity, rapid onset and the often-unpredictable nature of its occurrence. Physicians typically treat BTCP with a variety of short-acting opioid medications, including morphine, morphine and codeine derivatives and fentanyl.
 Morphine and codeine derivatives have been available for decades in immediate-release forms of tablets, capsules or liquids that are ingested by the patient. More recently-approved short-acting opioid-based fentanyl formulations utilize transmucosal delivery in an attempt to improve upon existing fentanyl therapies. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s ACTIQ®, approved by the FDA in 1998 and currently available in several generic options, is an oral transmucosal lozenge, and FENTORA®, the second leading branded TIRF product, approved by the FDA in 2006, is a fentanyl buccal tablet. Three other companies have received approval for branded TIRF products since 2009 including BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.’s Onsolis®, a soluble film placed on the buccal area after wetting the inside of the cheek with saliva or water, Sentynl Therapeutics’ Abstral®, an immediate-release transmucosal sublingual tablet, and West Therapeutic Development, LLC’s Lazanda®, a nasal spray. Although these existing therapies provide improvements over oral opioids, we believe that the market adoption of SUBSYS® to date demonstrates that the current treatment options have limitations and that there remains a significant unmet need for therapies that provide faster pain relief, more convenient dose administration and a better PK profile.  According to IQVIA, SUBSYS® prescriptions were approximately 24% and 29% of the TIRF market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Limitations of Competing TIRF Therapies
 We continue to believe that there are unmet needs in the BTCP market, which include:
  
• | Time until significant pain relief: Patients suffering from BTCP require rapid pain relief as peak intensity of episodic breakthrough pain can occur at less than one minute to 10 minutes from the onset of pain symptoms. The peak effect of ACTIQ® and FENTORA® may be delayed as it may take up to 15 to 30 minutes for the lozenge or tablet to fully dissolve and be absorbed. In addition, oral immediate-release opioids are metabolized in the liver and consequently, may take up to 30 to 45 minutes to become effective. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PK profile: ACTIQ® and its generic equivalents achieve bioavailability of approximately 51% and require 15 to 30 minutes for absorption. Up to half of the delivered dose of competing TIRF treatments is swallowed and is absorbed slowly through the GI tract which we believe may delay the onset of pain relief and contribute to side effects. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconvenient delivery: We believe competing commercially available therapies do not adequately address patient ease of use and convenience needs. Competing TIRF therapies can require an administration period of several minutes, disrupt daily activities and cause patient discomfort. For example, ACTIQ® requires patients to place a lozenge between their cheeks and lower gums and rub the lozenge from side to side over a 15-minute period. In addition, patients with dry mouth and oral mucositis may experience difficulty in using ACTIQ® and other commercially available therapies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solution
 We believe SUBSYS’® proprietary formulation and sublingual delivery mechanism offer several advantages over other FDA-approved TIRF products, and these advantages may lead to improved patient compliance and expanded medical use of fentanyl for BTCP. Such advantages include:

• | Pain relief in five minutes: SUBSYS® is the only product to show pain relief when measuring the sum of pain intensity difference at five minutes in a Phase 3 BTCP clinical trial using fentanyl. We believe that SUBSYS® is able to achieve this rapid delivery of fentanyl through sublingual delivery because there is a high density of blood vessels beneath the tongue and the thin layer in the mucosa enables higher absorption. The product sprays in a manner that is designed to maximize the area covered by the product. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One-step administration: SUBSYS® is administered in one step using a small handheld delivery system that sprays fentanyl beneath the patient’s tongue. This delivery mechanism allows for administration in less than one minute, rather than the 15 to 30 minutes required for ACTIQ® and FENTORA®. Further, SUBSYS® can be administered without moistening the tongue or cheek, allowing for administration in cancer patients suffering from dry mouth and oral mucositis. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PK profile: As compared to ACTIQ’s® PK profile, SUBSYS’® PK profile is characterized by higher peak blood concentrations, which are achieved at a more rapid rate. This profile is, in part, due to greater than 85% absorption occurring transmucosally, resulting in higher bioavailability. Because a small volume of liquid is sprayed on to the sublingual mucosa, we believe this method of administration reduces the amount of liquid swallowed and subsequently absorbed via the digestive system. As a result, we believe that less fentanyl is exposed to first-pass metabolism in the liver. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad spectrum of dosage strengths allows for proper titration and better pain relief: SUBSYS® is available in the most complete range of dosage strengths in the TIRF market, at 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1,200 and 1,600 mcg. We believe it is important to offer a product in all dose ranges for the treatment of BTCP, as all branded products without generic equivalents, and, to our knowledge, all product candidates currently in development, are not, or will not be, available in the 1,600 mcg dosage strength. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SUBSYS® Market Experience to Date
 Prescription Trends:    Monthly prescription data through December 2018 shows that approximately 184,000 prescriptions of SUBSYS® have been dispensed since launch in March 2012. In December 2018, SUBSYS® was the most prescribed branded TIRF product with approximately 24% market share on a prescription basis according to IQVIA. 
 The ongoing and heightened publicity surrounding the perceived national opioid epidemic continues to result in heightened sensitivity by many healthcare professionals to prescribe opioids, pharmacies to dispense opioids, patients to fill opioid prescriptions, distributors to distribute opioids and third-party payers to cover opioid prescriptions. Third-party payers, such as insurance companies and regulatory and government agencies, continue to scrutinize the prescription of opioids by healthcare professionals. In addition, we believe other high-profile initiatives, such as (i) President Trump’s declaration of the opioid crisis as a public health emergency, (ii) Congressional efforts to examine the causes of the opioid epidemic in public, and (iii) states, cities and counties initiating multi-district litigation against manufacturers and distributors of opioids have likely added to this sensitivity around opioid prescribing. Consequently, these current and potential future trends have affected, and will likely continue to affect, the manner in which, and the situations when, opioids, including SUBSYS®, are being prescribed, dispensed and approved for coverage. 
 Physician Prescriber Base:    Approximately 900 physicians were responsible for 90% of all TIRF prescriptions dispensed in 2018, according to IQVIA. We have targeted our commercialization efforts towards approximately 48% of these top 900 prescribing physicians with a focus on those prescribers with the highest number of BTCP patients. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were approximately 800 unique physician prescribers of SUBSYS®. 
 7



Patient Use:   Existing patient data generated by available databases demonstrates that the number of SUBSYS®-experienced patients has increased steadily, albeit at a much slower rate in recent years, since launch with over 24,000 unique patients as of December 2018. Importantly, the proportion of SUBSYS® prescriptions written for repeat SUBSYS® patients is approximately 91% of prescriptions as of December 2018. Generally, repeat SUBSYS® patients receive higher doses of SUBSYS® on average than first-time patients, as patients are titrated from a starter dose of SUBSYS® to their effective dose in accordance with the REMS protocol.
 Patient Access:    SUBSYS® is a covered medication available under most major commercial health insurance plans formularies. Some third-party payers require usage and failure on cheaper generic versions of ACTIQ® prior to providing reimbursement for SUBSYS® and other branded TIRF products. We concentrate on assisting physicians and payers with developing greater familiarity with both the differentiated features of SUBSYS® and the process to achieve patient access to the product from continued and broader usage of SUBSYS® by their patients. We offer commercially-insured patients a free trial of SUBSYS® to allow for titration to their effective dose and bridge the prior authorization process. Once third-party payer reimbursement is in place, we may offer patients coupons to reduce out of pocket costs.
Cannabinoid Product Family
 SYNDROS® (dronabinol oral solution)
 Our lead proprietary dronabinol product is SYNDROS®, an orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol.  The DEA issued an interim final ruling that resulted in SYNDROS® being placed in Schedule II of the CSA and the FDA approved the final labeling reflecting the scheduling in May 2017.  We commercially launched SYNDROS® in July 2017. Dronabinol, the active ingredient in Marinol®, is a synthetic form of THC. THC is an orally active cannabinoid that, like other cannabinoids, has complex effects on the central nervous system. Approved by the FDA in 1985, Marinol® is indicated for the treatment of CINV in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional treatments, as well as for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. Marinol® is formulated in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules and must be stored in cool storage conditions or in a refrigerator.
 We believe an unmet medical need exists for formulations of dronabinol that act more rapidly and are subject to less variable patient absorption. We completed a pivotal bioequivalence study that was a 52-patient crossover bioavailability and PK clinical trial comparing SYNDROS® with Marinol®. In the study, 100% of subjects receiving SYNDROS® achieved detectable plasma levels at 15 minutes compared to less than 25% of the subjects receiving Marinol®. Additionally, SYNDROS® demonstrated lower intra-subject variability relative to Marinol®. We believe these attributes may be a consideration for the providers in selecting the appropriate formulation of dronabinol for patients, which we also believe will allow us to further penetrate and potentially expand the market for the medical use of dronabinol. 
 Market Overview
 CINV is a commonly known side effect of chemotherapy that can have a significant negative impact on quality of patient life. CINV is classified into five categories:

• | Acute: Occurs within 24 hours of chemotherapy administration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delayed: Occurs more than 24 hours after chemotherapy administration, with peak intensity two to three days post-administration and duration of up to one week.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anticipatory: Occurs prior to treatment.
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Breakthrough: Occurs after use of antiemetic agents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Refractory: Occurs after failed use of breakthrough therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 8



The majority of chemotherapy patients experience at least one type of CINV. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network estimates that 70% to 80% of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience vomiting, with 10% to 44% experiencing anticipatory vomiting. Predictive factors for developing CINV can include: age of less than 50 years, female gender, vomiting during previous chemotherapy, pregnancy-induced nausea/vomiting, history of motion sickness and anxiety. In addition to generally affecting patient quality of life, CINV can result in weakness, weight loss, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration or anorexia. According to a study published by Ballatori, et al in 2007, 90% of patients who experienced CINV reported an impact on daily activities.
 Although the pathophysiology of CINV is not clearly understood, it is thought that chemotherapeutic agents cause vomiting by activating neurotransmitter receptors located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, GI tract, and VC. Activation of the VC directly or through the chemoreceptor trigger zone results in stimulation of the salivation and respiratory centers as well as control of the pharyngeal, GI and abdominal muscles. This stimulation can trigger the body to retch and vomit.
 Treatment of CINV is highly patient-specific and is based on the emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy regimen. According to IQVIA, U.S. sales for drugs treating CINV were $1.3 billion in 2013, though published reports suggest that current therapies are not entirely effective. A report published in Cancer estimated that approximately 35% of patients treated with CINV therapies continue to experience acute nausea, with 13% of CINV patients experiencing acute vomiting after first-line treatment.
 Limitations of Existing Therapies
 We believe that there are unmet needs for our cannabinoid products due to the limitations of existing therapies, which include:
  
• | Delayed absorption: Marinol® is only available in a capsule formulation, which must be dissolved and digested before it is metabolized in the patient’s liver, where the drug is broken down by enzymes. We believe that this capsule formulation and digestion process delays onset of action and relief of nausea and vomiting. After oral administration, Marinol® has an onset of action of approximately 30 minutes to one hour and peak effect at two to four hours. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Variable patient absorption: The uptake of Marinol® into systemic circulation varies widely from dose-to-dose and patient-to-patient. In general, this level of variability is atypical relative to approved pharmaceutical products. As such, physicians are unable to predict the level of efficacy or side effects that an individual patient might experience relative to other patients or even to a patient’s own last dose of dronabinol. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited second-line therapy options: Currently, there are a limited number of different classes of medications approved for CINV that are unresponsive to initial therapy. The availability of dronabinol offers a different class of medication than more traditional first-line antiemetics. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solutions
 We believe our SYNDROS® product has the potential to address some of the unmet needs that exist in synthetic cannabinoid products by providing a number of key advantages, including:

• | Fast absorption: SYNDROS® is a liquid solution and is absorbed faster than a capsule formulation that has to dissolve in the GI tract. We believe that quicker absorption may be an important consideration in the selection of a dronabinol product by physicians. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced dose-to-dose variability: Based on our PK study, we believe SYNDROS® has low variability of absorption between patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cannabidiol Oral Solution
 Cannabidiol has been shown pre-clinically to protect from seizures in various rodent models of seizures, to alleviate neuropathic pain caused by chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy mouse models treated with paclitaxel, and reduce tumor burden in xenograft mouse model of human glioblastoma tumors. We have developed a Cannabidiol Oral Solution, a CBD, for the potential treatment of rare childhood epilepsy syndromes that includes West Syndrome (Infantile Spasms) and Childhood Absence Epilepsy, for which we have received or applied for Orphan Drug Designation.
 In addition to the above epilepsy indications, we have also received Orphan Drug Designations for CBD in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, pontine glioma, and pediatric schizophrenia.
 Early studies in animal models demonstrate that CBD has anticonvulsant properties and the effectiveness of CBD-enriched cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy has been reported. A survey of children using a CBD-enriched plant product reported an 84% reduction in their child’s seizures, and 11% reported complete seizure freedom. In an open access program using a CBD-enriched plant deprived product, which included 214 patients who received drug, the median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 36.5% and the drug was generally well-tolerated. However, parental report can be subject to significant bias, especially where expectations are high.
 Currently, we have two ongoing and three completed studies in epilepsy. One ongoing study is a Phase 2 study in refractory Child Absence Epilepsy, evaluating three different doses: 20 mg/kg/day, 30 mg/kg/day, and 40 mg/kg/day. The second ongoing study is for Infantile Spasms patients involving adjunctive therapy with vigabatrin using the 40 mg/kg/day dose of CBD.
 The first completed study was a Phase 1b pharmacokinetic study that evaluated three different doses of CBD in pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy: 10mg/kg/day, 20mg/kg/day and 40mg/kg/day.  The second completed study was a long-term safety study of the children who completed the Phase 1b pharmacokinetic study and elected to continue treatment with CBD for an additional 48 weeks.
 The third completed study, a Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of Cannabidiol Oral Solution for the treatment of refractory Infantile Spasms, studied the effect of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in patients who have failed all approved treatments. This study has been completed and we are evaluating the development in Infantile Spasms in a less refractory population. 
 Prader-Willi Syndrome, first described in 1956, is a multifaceted developmental disorder and the most common genetic syndrome associated with obesity. It is caused by the absent expression of paternally-inherited genes in the chromosome region on 15q11-q13. While it presents with generalized hypotonia and developmental delay in infancy, Prader-Willi Syndrome then manifests with uncontrollable appetite, hyperphagia, and excessive weight gain leading to severe obesity, and it is the appetite behavior classified as hyperphagia in Prader-Willi Syndrome that is the most life threatening. Until recently, no patient lived over the age of 50 due to morbid obesity and its related complications. The mortality rate in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome is six times higher than patients with other intellectual disabilities. 
 Hyperphagic behaviors can also be dangerous in persons who are not obese, with increased risks of death due to choking while sneaking food, and gastric perforations after consuming more food than usual. Approximately 8% of deaths in individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome are reported due to the choking, especially on hot dogs. Prader-Willi Syndrome patients also are known to eat discarded (contaminated) food and items that are not for human consumption such as pet food, or even non-food items such as paint or paper. 
 Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of hyperphagia or obesity in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome. In addition, drugs that have demonstrated efficacy in the past have been withdrawn or have significant safety concerns (e.g., rimonabant, beloranib). Recent studies investigating modulation of the endocannabinoid system have shown promise.  
 10



The endocannabinoid system appears to be critically involved in the regulation of appetite, body weight, metabolism, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and reward brain circuitry. In clinical studies, compounds with endocannabinoid effects (fenfluramine, rimonabant) have shown significant effects on weight and appetite suppression.  These effects on appetite also occurred in 19% of epilepsy patients treated with Epidiolex© (i.e., cannabidiol extracted from the cannabis plant) during an open-access program for patients with pediatric seizure disorder.
We are currently conducting a clinical trial of the 40 mg/kg of CBD in pediatric patients who have Prader-Willi Syndrome to evaluate its effect on hyperphagia.
 We also provide Cannabidiol Oral Solution and some financial support for Investigator-Initiated Trials of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in various clinical settings such as cocaine dependence, autism, and early psychosis. These trials are currently ongoing or starting in 2019.
 Other Product Candidates
 Our other product candidates include other Cannabinoid line extensions and sublingual and nasal spray product candidates.
 Future Cannabinoid Line Extensions.    As described above, we plan to develop additional dronabinol delivery systems, including a proprietary inhalation dronabinol formulation. We also have the capability to manufacture synthetic cannabidiol and intend to work with medical researchers to determine its viability.
 Sublingual Spray Product Candidates.    As described above, we are conducting clinical and preclinical development for multiple well-known, approved molecules for delivery through our sublingual drug delivery technology. We intend to evaluate these and other products that we believe could have a differentiated efficacy and/or safety profile if formulated by us and delivered via a sublingual spray.
 Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray.  On September 29, 2017, we filed an NDA with the FDA for this product candidate, and on December 6, 2017, the FDA accepted the filing.  On July 27, 2018, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA, indicating that, although the clinical development program demonstrated all three proposed doses of the product candidate were statistically significantly different than placebo in providing pain relief, some of the data suggested potential safety concerns. Given the attributes of our proprietary buprenorphine formulation for sublingual delivery, we continue to believe that this drug-device combination could bring value to the management of pain and will assess the next steps for this product.
 Nasal Spray Product Candidates.  Two drug products are currently undergoing development for use as nasal spray devices, naloxone and epinephrine.  We have completed proof of concept studies for a naloxone nasal spray and are currently in the process of completing the non-clinical toxicology studies, including juvenile animal toxicity studies as part of the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”).  We intend to file an NDA in the second quarter of 2019.  In addition, we received fast track designation from the FDA and completed proof-of-concept and dose-finding PK studies for an epinephrine nasal spray to be used for the treatment of allergic reactions (Type 1) including anaphylaxis.
Sales and Marketing
 We currently market SUBSYS® and SYNDROS® in the United States through our commercial sales organization. Our product detailing efforts focus primarily on oncologists, pain specialists and centers that cater to supportive care.
 We do not currently have internal sales and marketing capabilities outside of the United States. We are evaluating opportunities to sell our products internationally, and have entered into arrangements with third parties to pursue requisite regulatory approvals in the Middle East.

We believe some of the key factors in generating growth in SUBSYS® usage include: (i) taking market share from other competing TIRF products and increasing access of the product to appropriate cancer patients suffering from BTCP, and (ii) increasing awareness of the prevalence of BTCP among oncologists and highlight the efficient benefits of SUBSYS®, which include rapid onset of analgesia, improved bioavailability, patient satisfaction and ease of administration relative to other TIRF products.
 As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 4,500 physicians enrolled in the TIRF REMS program. Enrollment in this class-wide REMS program is required by the FDA as of March 2012 in order to prescribe TIRF products. Approximately 900 physicians comprise 90% of TIRF prescriptions dispensed in 2018, according to IQVIA. Our sales and marketing efforts have primarily targeted approximately 48% of these top 900 prescribing physicians with a focus on those prescribers with the highest number of BTCP patients.
 We believe some of the key factors in generating growth in SYNDROS® usage include: (i) continuing to drive product awareness of the benefits of SYNDROS® as the first FDA approved liquid cannabinoid with the appropriate healthcare professionals, (ii) increasing the education on the different mechanism of action between SYNDROS® and other antiemetics, and (iii) converting branded and generic dronabinol usage by reducing financial and payer barriers for the patient.
 The majority of our sales of SUBSYS® and SYNDROS® are to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and specialty retail pharmacies.  Wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, in turn, sell the products to pharmacies, hospitals and other customers, whereas specialty retail pharmacies sell the products directly to patients. For the year ended December 31, 2018, three wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc., individually comprised approximately 33%, 15%, and 10%, respectively, and two specialty retail pharmacies individually comprised 18% and 21%, of our total gross sales of SUBSYS® and SYNDROS®.  For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and History—We depend on wholesale distributors and specialty retail pharmacies for retail distribution of SUBSYS® and SYNDROS®; if we lose any of our significant wholesale distributors or specialty retail pharmacies, our business could be harmed” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We produce dronabinol, the API in our dronabinol product family, including our proprietary dronabinol product candidates, internally at our U.S.-based, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Round Rock, TX. We believe that this facility has the capacity to supply sufficient commercial quantities of dronabinol API for SYNDROS®, as well as to support the continued development of our other cannabinoid product candidates in the near-term. We believe this facility gives us a significant competitive advantage since dronabinol API is a Schedule I material and, consequently, is subject to annual production limits set by DEA quotas for each individual facility, cannot be readily procured, is difficult to import into the United States and has a limited number of suppliers domestically. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and History—We may encounter manufacturing failures that could impede or delay commercial production of SYNDROS®, or the preclinical and clinical development or regulatory approval of our dronabinol product candidates” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 In 2014, we completed construction of a second domestic dronabinol manufacturing facility, which will enable us to supply additional commercial quantities of dronabinol API for our continued commercialization of SYNDROS® and any of our proprietary dronabinol product candidates, if approved. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and History—We have expanded our SYNDROS® capacity by constructing a second facility. We may encounter a number of challenges relating to the management and operation of such a facility, and we may never realize a return on our investment” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 The chemical materials for dronabinol API are sourced from independent suppliers and are manufactured utilizing well-established chemical techniques. Our manufacturing facility utilizes these chemical materials to produce dronabinol through a series of synthetic reactions and purification cycles. We believe that our suppliers are equipped to meet our current and future chemical material needs for the commercialization of SYNDROS®, and the development and commercialization of our dronabinol-based product candidates.

We purchase the fentanyl API utilized in connection with SUBSYS® from one vendor as our sole supplier of the API in this product.  In addition, SUBSYS® is manufactured by contract manufacturers and sub-component fabricators.  Aptar and Renaissance have been selected for their specific competencies in manufacturing, product design and materials. FDA regulations require that materials be produced under cGMPs or quality system regulations, as required for the respective unit operation within the manufacturing process. We believe both key suppliers have sufficient capacity to meet our projected product requirements.
 
Aptar
 
Aptar, a dispensing system company based in Illinois, developed the sublingual spray device we use for SUBSYS®. We entered into a supply agreement, effective as of March 7, 2011, with Aptar pursuant to which Aptar supplies us with the delivery system to administer SUBSYS®. We are required to provide Aptar with rolling quarterly forecasts of our requirement for SUBSYS® drug delivery systems. Under certain circumstances, such forecasts are non-binding; however, some portions of such forecasts may constitute a firm commitment to purchase delivery systems. The agreement has a term of five years from the effective date, subject to early termination clauses. On October 30, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated supply, development & exclusive licensing agreement with Aptar, which, among other things, extended our exclusive supply rights to the current sublingual device, currently utilized by SUBSYS®, as well as any new device(s) jointly developed by the two companies for a period of seven years. In addition to extending the term, this amendment added certain minimum purchase commitments and requires certain tiered royalties as a percentage of net revenue to be paid by us ranging from less than one percent to the low single digits, commencing in March 2016 through the term of the agreement, from our sales of SUBSYS® and future products that use the Aptar spray device technology. 
 
In January 2016, we assigned our rights, title, duties and obligations of our supply, development & exclusive licensing agreement with Aptar from our parent to our manufacturing subsidiary as part of a corporate restructuring.  
 
In April 2017, we, through our manufacturing subsidiary, entered into a further amendment to our Aptar supply, development and exclusive licensing agreement. This amendment effectively eliminated any prior minimum purchase obligations that had been set forth in the amendment, dated October 30, 2015, and beginning in 2019, replaces them with a new annual flat fee of up to $500,000 if the quantity of devices purchased in a calendar year is less than one million devices. As a result, the cumulative effect related to this amendment reduces our aggregated purchase commitment with Aptar from $20,790,000 to $9,000,000 through December 21, 2022. 
 
Renaissance
 
We entered into a manufacturing agreement effective as of May 24, 2011 with Renaissance pursuant to which we engaged Renaissance on an exclusive basis to provide processing and packaging services with respect to SUBSYS®. The contract requires us to provide rolling quarterly forecasts, a portion of which constitute firm purchase commitments. In April 2015, we entered into an amendment to our manufacturing and supply agreement with Renaissance, which extends our existing manufacturing and supply agreement to produce SUBSYS® until the end of 2020. In addition to extending the term, this amendment added certain minimum purchase commitments. 
 
In January 2016, we assigned our rights, title, duties and obligations of our manufacturing and supply agreement with Renaissance from our parent to our manufacturing subsidiary as part of a corporate restructuring.  
 
In April 2018, we, through our manufacturing subsidiary, entered into a further amendment to our Renaissance manufacturing and supply agreement. This amendment effectively eliminated any prior minimum purchase (and batch) obligations that had been set forth in the amendment dated July 2016 and replaces them with a new annual purchase commitment of $3,000,000 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, and $2,000,000 for the calendar years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020. As a result, the cumulative effect related to this amendment reduces our aggregated purchase commitment with Renaissance from $12,000,000 to $7,000,000 through December 31, 2020.
 13



In February 2019, we, through our manufacturing subsidiary, entered into a further amendment to our Renaissance manufacturing and supply agreement. This amendment effectively eliminates any prior and future minimum purchase (and batch) obligations that had been set forth in the amendment dated April 2018.  In addition, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement in which we agreed to sell, and Renaissance agreed to purchase, certain of our manufacturing equipment.

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a loss of $359,000 and $1,035,000, respectively, in cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for a portion of this commitment to Renaissance which represented firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our current forecasts for future demand.  
 
For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and History—We are dependent on numerous third parties in our supply chain for the commercial supply of SUBSYS® and SYNDROS®, and if we fail to maintain our supply and manufacturing relationships with these third parties or fail to develop new relationships with other third parties, we may be unable to continue to commercialize SUBSYS® and SYNDROS®,  or to develop other product candidates” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
 Competition
 Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of our products and the development of our product candidates include, but are not limited to, onset of action, bioavailability, efficacy, cost, convenience of dosing, safety, tolerability profile, DEA scheduling and intellectual property rights. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we do, and greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing product candidates, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for the treatment of BTCP, CINV and anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS, or other indications we pursue that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely-prescribed or accepted, more useful and less costly, and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. We also face competition from third parties in obtaining allotments of fentanyl and dronabinol under applicable DEA production and procurement quotas, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials and in identifying and acquiring or in-licensing new products and product candidates.
SUBSYS® 
 SUBSYS® competes against numerous branded and generic products already being marketed and potentially those which are or will be in development. SUBSYS® is one of nine commercially available products in the TIRF market. In the BTCP market, physicians often treat patients with a variety of short-acting opioid medications, including morphine, morphine and codeine derivatives and fentanyl. Some currently marketed products against which we directly compete include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s FENTORA® and ACTIQ®, Sentynl Therapeutics’ Abstral®, West Therapeutic Development, LLC’s Lazanda® and BioDelivery Science International, Inc.’s Onsolis®. Some generic fentanyl products against which SUBSYS® competes are marketed by Mallinckrodt, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies and Actavis, Inc. 
 14



Cannabinoid Product Family
 With respect to our dronabinol product candidates, the market in which we intend to compete is challenging in part because of the presence of generic products. We or our distributors may not be able to differentiate any products that we may market from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better performance than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. In addition, there are a number of established therapies and products already commercially available and under development by other companies that treat the indications which SYNDROS® and our dronabinol product candidates are intended to treat. Specifically, SYNDROS®, and our other dronabinol product candidates, will compete against therapies and products such as AbbVie, Inc.’s Marinol® and Marinol® generics. Par Pharmaceutical Companies markets an approved generic version of Marinol®, and Actavis, Inc. markets an authorized generic version of Marinol®. Moreover, our cannabinoid products may compete with non-synthetic cannabinoid drugs, including therapies such as GW Pharmaceuticals plc’s Sativex® and Epidiolex®, especially in many countries outside of the United States where non-synthetic cannabinoids are legal. In addition, literature has been published arguing the benefits of natural cannabis, or marijuana, over dronabinol, and there are a number of states that have already enacted laws legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana. There is some support in the United States for further legalization of marijuana. We also cannot assess the extent to which patients utilize marijuana illegally to alleviate CINV, instead of using prescribed therapies such as approved dronabinol products. Furthermore, in the treatment of CINV, physicians typically offer conventional anti-nausea agents prior to initiating chemotherapy, such as Sanofi’s Anzemet®, Eisai Inc./Helsinn Group’s Aloxi®, Roche Holding AG’s Kytril®, Par Pharmaceutical Companies’ Zuplenz® and GlaxoSmithKline plc’s Zofran®, as well as Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists on the market including Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.’s Sancuso® and Merck & Co., Inc.’s Emend®. To the extent that SYNDROS® and our dronabinol product candidates, if approved, compete in a broader segment of the CINV market, we will also face competition from these products.
 Additionally, we are aware of companies that have received approval for the commercialization of CINV products, including Heron Therapeutics, Inc.’s (formerly A.P. Pharma, Inc.) Sustrol®, Tesaro, Inc.’s Varubi®, and Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc.’s Akynzeo®. If these products are successfully marketed over the next few years, they could represent significant competition for SYNDROS®. Additionally, Aphios Corp.’s Zindol® is in late stage development (Phase 3), and if successfully developed and approved, could represent significant competition for SYNDROS®.
 Intellectual Property
 The success of most of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
  
• | obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prosecute our patent applications and defend our issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for certain of our product candidates, drug delivery systems, molecular modifications, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for medical uses, processes for preparation, processes for delivery and formulations.
 As of March 5, 2019, we owned or licensed from third parties a total of ninety-four worldwide patents and sixty-two patent applications including twenty-seven issued U.S. utility patents and twenty-nine pending U.S. utility patent applications. These U.S. patents and patent applications will expire between 2022 and 2039. Some of the issued patents and pending applications, if issued, may also be eligible for patent term adjustment and patent term restoration, thereby extending their patent terms.
 15



SUBSYS® 
 Our SUBSYS® patent portfolio currently consists of nine Orange Book listed (with the FDA) U.S. Patent Nos. 8,486,972, 8,486,973, 8,835,459, 8,835,460, 9,241,935, 9,289,387, 9,642,797, 9,642,844, and 10,016,403, and two pending U.S. patent applications. These patents are directed to SUBSYS® brand fentanyl and/or the use of the SUBSYS® sublingual fentanyl spray for the treatment of pain and will expire in 2027 and 2030. We also currently have sixty-six issued foreign patents and four pending foreign patent applications covering formulations and methods of use relating to SUBSYS®. Any patents that issue from our pending foreign patents and applications are expected to expire no earlier than 2027.
Dronabinol
 Our dronabinol patent portfolio currently consists of four issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. patent applications. Two of the U.S. patents are directed to formulations of dronabinol and methods of manufacturing and packaging dronabinol in capsules. Two of the U.S. patents and the pending applications are directed to SYNDROS® brand oral solution formulations of dronabinol. Three of the issued dronabinol patents will expire in 2028, while the forth will expire in 2033. Any patents that issue from our pending patent applications will likely expire between 2028 and 2039.
Other
 The rest of our patent portfolio relates to patents and applications owned or licensed by us and directed to other potential product candidates. 
 Although we believe our rights under these patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain issued patents from pending applications. Even if patents are granted, the allowed claims may not be sufficient to adequately protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. Any patents or patent rights that we obtain carry some risk of being circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. For example, a former officer of Insys Pharma sought unsuccessfully to rescind his assignment of his inventions concerning fentanyl and dronabinol patent applications described above. Ownership and inventorship disputes may arise for other patents and applications that we own or license.
 We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement before they begin providing services to us. Among other things, this agreement obligates each employee, consultant or advisor to refrain from disclosing any of our confidential information received during the course of providing services and, with some exceptions, to assign to us any inventions conceived or developed during the course of these services. We also require confidentiality agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information.
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. As our current and potential product candidates and others based upon our proprietary technologies progress toward commercialization, the possibility of an infringement claim against us increases. While we attempt to be certain that our products and proprietary technologies do not infringe other parties’ patents and other proprietary rights, competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe on their proprietary rights.
 We have conducted certain clearance searches of issued U.S. patents for our fentanyl formulations but we have not conducted extensive clearance searches for SYNDROS® or our other product candidates, and cannot guarantee that the searches we have done were fully comprehensive and, therefore, whether SUBSYS®, SYNDROS® or any of our product candidates, delivery devices, or methods of using, making or delivering our product candidates infringe the patents searched, or that other patents do not exist that cover SUBSYS®, SYNDROS® or our product candidates, delivery devices or these methods. Interpreting patent claims involves complex legal and scientific questions and it is difficult to assess whether or not our product candidates would infringe any patent. Likewise, it is difficult to predict whether or not third-party patent applications will issue and 
 16



what claim scope they may obtain. If we conclude that any identified patents, or patent applications once issued as patents, cover SUBSYS®, SYNDROS® or any of our product candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to formulate around such patents at all or without material delay or whether we can obtain reasonable license terms from the patent owners, if at all. There may also be other pending patent applications that are unknown to us and, if granted, may prevent us from making, using or selling SUBSYS®, SYNDROS® or our product candidates. Other product candidates that we may develop, either internally or in collaboration with others, could be subject to similar uncertainties. If a product is found to infringe a third-party patent, we could be prevented from developing and selling that product. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”
 Environmental and Safety Matters
 We use hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern, among other things, the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts.
 In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or environmental contamination from these materials. If one of our employees was accidentally injured as a result of the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials, the medical costs related to his or her treatment should be within the coverage terms of our workers’ compensation insurance policy. However, we do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. regulations may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending INDs, and NDAs or the issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves, among other things, preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease indicated for treatment.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, stability, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Certain nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may be conducted after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the IND within this 30-day period, the proposed clinical trial may begin.
 17



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing in U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human volunteers, the drug is tested to assess safety, metabolism, PK, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the efficacy and safety of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
 The current FDA standards for approving new pharmaceutical products are more stringent than those that were applied in the past. These standards were not applied to many established products currently on the market, including certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently. The FDA has recently expressed an intention to develop safety data for certain products, including many opioids. In particular, the FDA has expressed interest in specific impurities that may be present in a number of opioid narcotic APIs, such as oxycodone. Based on certain structural characteristics, these impurities may have the potential to cause mutagenic effects. If, after testing, such effects are ultimately demonstrated to exist, more stringent controls on the levels of these impurities may be required for FDA approval of products containing these impurities, such as oxymorphone. Any additional testing or remedial measures that may be necessary could result in increased costs for, or delays in, obtaining approval for certain of our products in development.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment fees per product and per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the PDUFA the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA has a goal of reviewing applications for non-priority drug products within 12 months of NDA submission. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically comprised of a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The 
 18



FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless the facility demonstrates compliance with cGMPs and the NDA contains data that provides substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the indication sought in the proposed labeling. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs before approving an NDA.
 After the FDA evaluates the data in the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, clinical sites, and the proposed product label, it may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms that can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, dosage, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a new or supplemental NDA may need to be submitted, which may require additional data or additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 The FDA may require sponsors of investigational drugs to submit proposed REMS in order to ensure that the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks associated with its use. Sponsors of certain drug applications approved without a REMS program may also be required to submit a proposed REMS program if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information and makes a determination that a REMS program is necessary.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the RLD and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the RLD. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, but are required to conduct bioequivalence testing, which compares the bioavailability of their drug product to that of the RLD to confirm chemical and therapeutic equivalence. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic versions of the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA that any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book have expired or are not applicable. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents via a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the ANDA until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 19



If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. As an incentive for the rapid development of generic drug products, the first ANDA(s) filed that challenges a listed patent by filing a Paragraph IV certification may be granted a 180-day marketing exclusivity period during which the FDA may not approve another ANDA for the same product. There may be multiple such “first filers.” The 180-day marketing exclusivity period is triggered either by commercial launch of any first-filed ANDA approved product or from the date of a court decision finding the challenged patent to be invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is first. The 180-day exclusivity can be forfeited, among other reasons, if the first filed and approved ANDA is not marketed, does not obtain tentative approval or the challenged patent expires.
 The ANDA also will not be approved until any non-patent market exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides an exclusive period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law additionally provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor. The FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug during this three-year period.
 Section 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings from preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on findings of safety or efficacy for an already approved product, the applicant is subject to existing exclusivity for the reference product and is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 20



Post-Approval FDA Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to extensive and ongoing post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. FDA post-market regulations also include, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, manufacturing and reporting of adverse events arising from use of the product. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, recall or market withdrawal, fines, warning letters, refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of approvals, product seizure or detention, injunctions and/or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and can take the same actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing original NDAs.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 commitments or requirements, a REMS program and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. The FDA and comparable state regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is also subject to the PDMA, which governs the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the licensing and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies
 On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a single shared REMS for TIRF products. TIRF products, which include the brand-name drugs Abstral®, ACTIQ®, FENTORA®, Lazanda®, Onsolis® and SUBSYS®, are narcotic pain medicines called opioids used to manage breakthrough pain in adults with cancer who routinely take other opioid pain medicines around-the-clock. The program officially began in March 2012.
 The goals of the TIRF REMS Access Program are to ensure patient access to important medications and mitigate the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and serious complications due to medication errors by:
  
• | prescribing and dispensing TIRF products only to appropriate patients, including use only in opioid-tolerant patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preventing inappropriate conversion between fentanyl products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | preventing accidental exposure to children and others for whom TIRF products were not prescribed; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | educating prescribers, pharmacists, and patients on the potential for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21



Healthcare professionals who prescribe TIRF products that will only be used in an inpatient setting (hospitals, hospices, or long-term care facilities) are not required to enroll in the TIRF REMS Access Program. Similarly, patients who receive TIRF products in an inpatient setting are not required to enroll in the program. Long-term care and hospice patients who obtain their medications from outpatient pharmacies, however, must be enrolled.
 Controlled Substances; Drug Enforcement Administration
 We sell products that are “controlled substances” as defined in the CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage and other requirements administered by the DEA. States impose similar requirements. The DEA regulates entities that handle controlled substances and the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. Except for research and industrial purposes, a pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances considered to present the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Fentanyl, the active ingredient in our SUBSYS® product, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II substance under the CSA. Consequently, its manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, manufacturing of fentanyl is subject to a DEA regulated quota system. In addition, generally all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician and physically presented to a pharmacist before filling and may not be refilled without a new prescription.
 DEA registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized to be handled under that registration.
 The DEA typically inspects certain facilities to review their security controls, recordkeeping and reporting prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Security measures required by the DEA include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as vaults, cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, suspicious orders, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 A DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. This includes manufacturing of the API and production of dosage forms. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Absent the Marinol®-like formulation and encapsulation exception, dronabinol is a Schedule I controlled substance and, therefore, subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much total dronabinol may be produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount of dronabinol that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. We or our partners, including our contract manufacturers, must obtain an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including dronabinol and fentanyl. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual manufacturing quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of the active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 22



The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including licensing, recordkeeping and security.
 Controlled substances are also regulated pursuant to several international drug control treaties. These treaties are enforced by the United National Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The United States is a signatory to these treaties and thus must conform its laws and regulations to the international requirements, which generally include licensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Both fentanyl and dronabinol are currently classified under the international treaties and current U.S. controls adequately address international requirements. Any change in the international treaties regarding classification of these products could affect regulation of these substances in the United States and in other countries.
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include Anti-Kickback and False Claims statutes. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the PPACA which amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also lead to violations of the False Claims Act. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
 23



and False Claims Act, which state laws apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Moreover, qui tam suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as “relators” or “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend such qui tam actions and pay substantial sums to settle such actions.
 Also, the HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 The commercial success of our products and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our products, product candidates, and related treatments.
 Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the U.S., the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting, and the effect of any healthcare reform, could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any products or approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
 The MMA imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.  In 2018, CMS 
 24



published a roadmap outlining their efforts to address the opioid epidemic.  Under this roadmap, new policies, which went into effect on January 1, 2019, were implemented for Part D plans that include improved safety alerts when opioid prescriptions are dispensed at the pharmacy, and drug management programs to better coordinate care when chronic high-risk opioid use is present.  While CMS recognizes that a “one size fits all” approach does not take into account different circumstances related to opioid use, and has stated that patients being treated for active cancer-related pain are exempt from these interventions, further restrictions could be placed on opioid prescriptions.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our products or product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the PPACA, which changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers.
 Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
 We may be subject to various privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the related final published omnibus rule. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent then HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Approval Outside the United States
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, and may be otherwise complicated by our product candidates being controlled substances such as synthetic cannabinoids and fentanyl. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval and DEA classification. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 25



We have initiated early stage discussions with the Medicines Evaluation Board (“MEB”) in the Netherlands to solicit feedback on potential approval pathway for SUBSYS®, and have entered into arrangements with third parties to pursue requisite regulatory approvals in the Middle East. As in the United States, the regulatory approval process in Europe and in other countries is a lengthy, challenging and inherently uncertain process.
 Research and Development
Our operating results will also depend significantly on our research and development activities and related regulatory developments. Our research and development expenses were $57.6 million, $63.0 million and $73.9 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had 50 and 61 full-time research and development personnel, respectively. We expect research and development expenses to fluctuate with the timing of our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, particularly our proprietary cannabinoid product candidates and sublingual spray product candidates. We do not expect to realize net revenues from all of these research and development initiatives in the near term and may never realize net revenues from these investments. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Performance—Product Development and Related Regulatory Processes”. 
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 226 full-time employees, including 62 manufacturing employees, 66 sales and marketing employees, 50 employees in research and development, and 48 employees in administration. None of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Scientific Advisory Board 
 We have established a scientific advisory board consisting of industry experts with knowledge of our target markets. Our scientific advisors generally meet twice a year as a group to assist us in formulating our research, development, clinical and sales and marketing strategies. Some individual scientific advisors consult with and meet informally with us on a more frequent basis. Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our scientific advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.
Available Information
 We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports available, free of charge, in the “Investors” section of our Internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or furnish these materials to, the SEC. Our website is www.insysrx.com. Additionally, you will find these materials on the SEC Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
