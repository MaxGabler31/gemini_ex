ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

 
AmeriCann, Inc. (“AmeriCann”) is a specialized cannabis company that is developing state-of-the-art product manufacturing and greenhouse cultivation facilities. Our business plan is based on the continued growth of the regulated marijuana market in the United States.
 
AmeriCann uses greenhouse technology which is superior to the current industry standard of growing cannabis in warehouse facilities under artificial lights. According to industry experts, by capturing natural sunlight, greenhouses use 25 percent fewer lights, and utility bills are up to 75 percent less than in typical warehouse cultivation facilities. As such, AmeriCann’s Canopy System enables cannabis to be produced with a greatly reduced carbon footprint, making the final product less expensive. Additionally, greenhouse construction costs can be nearly half of warehouse construction costs. AmeriCann’s business is committed to sustainable, clean cultivation of medical cannabis and to social and environmental ethics, transparency and accountability.
 
AmeriCann’s team includes board members, expert consultants, engineers and architects who specialize in real estate development, traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, medical research, facility construction, regulatory compliance, security, cannabis cultivation and genetics, extraction processes, and infused product development.
 
AmeriCann’s flagship project is the Massachusetts Cannabis Center. The Massachusetts Cannabis Center (“MCC”) is being developed on a 52-acre parcel located in southeastern Massachusetts. AmeriCann’s MCC project is permitted for 987,000 sq. ft. of cannabis cultivation and processing infrastructure, which is being developed in phases to support both the existing medical cannabis and the emerging adult-use cannabis marketplace.
 
The first phase of the million square foot project, Building 1, a 30,000 square foot cultivation and processing facility, is fully-operational and is currently 100% leased by a vertically-integrated Massachusetts cannabis company.
 
See “Massachusetts Cannabis Center” below for more information.
 
Massachusetts Cannabis Center
 
On October 17, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of the 52.6-acre parcel of undeveloped land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The property is located approximately 47 miles southeast of Boston. We are developing the property as the Massachusetts Cannabis Center (“MCC”). 
 
As part of a simultaneous transaction, we assigned the property rights to Massachusetts Medical Properties, LLC (“MMP”) for a nominal fee and entered a lease agreement pursuant to which MMP agreed to lease the property to us for an initial term of fifty (50) years. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for four (4) additional ten (10) year periods. The lease is a triple net lease, with the Company paying all real estate taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance.
 
The lease payments are the greater of (a) $30,000 per month; (b) $0.38 per square foot per month of any structure built on the property; or (c) 1.5% of all gross monthly sales of products sold by the Company, any assignee of the Company, or any subtenant of the Company. The lease payments will be adjusted up (but not down) every five (5) years by any increase in the Consumer Price Index.

Plans for the MCC include the construction of sustainable greenhouse cultivation and processing facilities that will be leased to Registered Marijuana Dispensaries under the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana and Adult Use Programs
 
The Town of Freetown Planning Board has approved our site plan application for the MCC. The site plan application requested 977,000 square feet of infrastructure for cannabis cultivation, processing, testing and associated administration in Freetown's Industrial Park. 
 
We are developing MCC in phases that will consist of three different building sites. The buildings have been approved for the following approximate sizes:
 
Building 1: 30,000 square feet
 Building 2: 370,000 square feet
 Building 3: 600,000 square feet.
 
Building 1 is a fully-constructed and operational, state-of-the-art greenhouse cultivation and product manufacturing facility.
 
On July 26, 2019 we entered into a Triple Net Lease for Building 1 with BASK, Inc. ("BASK"), a related party. Building 1, an Adult-Use and Medical cannabis cultivation and processing facility, is the first phase of the MCC. BASK commenced operations in Building 1 in February of 2020 and is licensed by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission to cultivate, process and sell cannabis.
 
The 15-year lease for Building 1 with BASK provides, in addition to a monthly Base Rent, a Revenue Participation Fee whereby we will receive 15% of all gross monthly sales of cannabis, cannabis-infused products and non-cannabis products produced at Building 1.
 
Building 2 is the next phase of the MCC development where we will occupy space for cannabis cultivation and product manufacturing. Designs for Building 2 include 370,000 square feet of greenhouses for cultivation and GMP certified product manufacturing and extraction capabilities.
 
On November 19, 2020, AmeriCann received two licenses from the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission. The licenses are for Cannabis Cultivation and a license for Cannabis Product Manufacturing. The Cannabis Cultivation and Cannabis Product Manufacturing licenses awarded to AmeriCann are designated to be operated in Building 2 of the MCC.
 
For the remainder of the project we intend to enter into agreements with other licensed cannabis businesses in Massachusetts to occupy space in the MCC. We will generate revenue through lease arrangements with the operators that include base rents and revenue participation fee payments up to 15% of gross revenue generated from products produced at the MCC. We plan to replicate the brands, technology and innovations developed at the MCC to new markets.

Market Conditions
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces several major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers in the United States. Second, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there is a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of cultivators, processors and retailers in these states. As explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law. These obstacles to the cannabis industry require financial resources, expertise and dedicated advocacy to change regulations on the state level.
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law.  Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.  The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.”  If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Although many states have legalized cannabis for medical and recreational use by adults, the state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. Although previous administrations have indicated that they are not opposed to the legalization of marijuana any change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.
 
Competition
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that are involved in the cannabis industry, many of which we consider to be our competition. Many of these companies provide services similar to those which we provide or plan to provide.  We expect that other companies will recognize the value of serving the cannabis industry and become our competitors.
