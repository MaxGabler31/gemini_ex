ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 SeaChange International, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded on July 9, 1993, is an industry leader in the delivery of multiscreen, advertising and premium over the top (“OTT”) video management solutions headquartered in Acton, Massachusetts. Our products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video and advertising content for cable television system operators, telecommunications companies, satellite operators and media companies. We sell our software products and services worldwide, primarily to television service providers including: cable television system operators, such as Liberty Global, plc. (“LGI”), Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”), Cox Communications, Inc. and Rogers Communications, Inc.; telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., AT&T, Inc. and Frontier Communications Corporation; satellite operators such as Direct TV and Dish Network Corporation; and media companies such as Filmbank Media.
 Our products and services are designed to empower video providers to create, manage and monetize the increasingly personalized, highly engaging experiences that viewers demand. Using our products and services, we believe customers can increase revenues by offering services such as video-on-demand (“VOD”) programming on a variety of consumer devices, including televisions (“TVs”), mobile telephones (“smart phones”), personal computers (“PCs”), tablets and OTT streaming players. Our solutions enable service providers to offer other interactive television services that allow subscribers to receive personalized services and interact with their video devices, thereby enhancing their viewing experience. Our products also allow our customers to insert advertising into broadcast and VOD content. 
 SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasing, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewing habits are shifting. The primary driver of our business is enabling the delivery of video assets in the changing multiscreen television environment. Through strategic collaborations, we have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players. We believe that our strategy of expanding into adjacent product lines will also position us to further support and maintain our existing service provider customer base. Providing our customers with more scalable software platforms enables them to further reduce their infrastructure costs, improve reliability and expand service offerings to their customers. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serving adjacent markets, such as mobile and OTT. Our core technologies provide a foundation for products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber activity across multiple devices. 
 On May 5, 2016, we acquired a 100% share of DCC Labs in exchange for an aggregate of $2.7 million in newly issued shares of SeaChange common stock and $5.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired, resulting in a total net purchase price of $7.9 million. DCC Labs is a developer of set-top and multiscreen device software. The acquisition of DCC Labs in fiscal 2017 enabled us to optimize the operations of our In-Home business, which developed home video gateway software including SeaChange’s Nucleus and NitroX products. In addition, the acquisition brought market-ready products, including an optimized television software stack for Europe’s Digital Video Broadcasting community, and an HTML5 framework for building additional user experience client applications across a variety of CPE devices, including Android TV STBs, tablets, mobile and computer devices. During fiscal 2018, the In-Home business became the center of engineering and expanded to include product development for backoffice, advertising and legacy products. The Poland operation became the prime engineering location and as of the end of fiscal 2018, was the largest location by number of engineers. In addition, the engineering efforts were combined and the teams were re-organized into a single global team in fiscal 2018, which spans a reduced number of locations globally compared to fiscal 2017. As part of the engineering transition, organizational improvements were implemented in order to focus on software quality, reliability and pre-integration, in order to de-risk deployments and improve go-to-market time for new solutions and existing upgrades. The global engineering team introduced DevOps practices with a customer-centric view of technology improvements across all products within the SeaChange solution. Along with operational improvements, engineering introduced changes to process and workflow which enabled more accurate effort estimations and velocity tracking. With the introduction of common agile project methodology across all teams and products, the efficiency of software engineering increased, which allowed more engineering resources to focus on innovation and development of industry leading features and enhancements to existing products as well as new product releases that expand the SeaChange technology franchise. At the same time, improved efficiency and better allocation of software developers enabled a more lean and targeted approach to supporting existing deployments and delivering upon support commitments for legacy products using a cost-optimized workforce.
 In conjunction with the DCC Labs acquisition and an additional company-wide cost savings program established in the second half of fiscal 2017, SeaChange commenced a restructuring program (“Restructuring Program”), which has allowed us to achieve approximately $38 million in annualized cost savings since its commencement. The Restructuring Program resulted in aggregate charges of $9.2 million as of January 31, 2018 in severance and other restructuring costs. These charges include costs for workforce reductions, facility closings and other costs to complete the restructuring, such as legal and consulting fees. As of January 31, 2018, the Restructuring Program has been completed and has helped us improve operations and optimize our cost structure since its 
 4


inception. Any remaining costs related to the Restructuring Program will be expensed as incurred to severance and other restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in future quarters.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our business is focused on the following product areas: video platform (including content management), advertising and user experience. Our revenue sources consist of product revenue from these areas, as well as related services. 
Video Platform
 SeaChange Adrenalin Multiscreen Video Backoffice Platform. Adrenalin is a comprehensive software platform that enables service providers to manage, monetize and deliver a seamless viewing experience to subscribers across TVs, PCs, tablets, smart phones and other IP-enabled devices. Adrenalin is a modular software solution allowing customers to gradually adopt new functionality and features to expand multiscreen television distribution capabilities. We offer our Adrenalin platform under two deployment options: through onsite software licenses and on a cloud-based offering through software-as-a-service (“SaaS”). With an onsite software license model, revenue is derived from perpetual software licenses, maintenance and support fees and professional services. In a SaaS offering, we license our product offerings and customers pay us on a monthly recurring basis based on the total number of subscribers deployed by the customer.
 SeaChange AssetFlow Content Management Solution. In today’s multiscreen viewing environment, programming or advertisements are reproduced with numerous variants to serve the unique requirements of multiple network types, consumer devices and geographies. Metadata, such as poster, description and pricing, associated with the programming, is also managed by the platform. At the point of content ingest, our AssetFlow software is used to receive, manage and publish video content for viewing on televisions, tablets, PCs and other consumer devices. AssetFlow simplifies the increasingly complex tasks of movie and television program asset tracking, metadata management, and overall content workflow processing.
 End-to-End Integrated Platforms. Leveraging the experience gained through our SeaChange Rave™ offering, we continue to expand our offerings in the integrated platform service/solution market.
 Advertising
SeaChange Infusion Advanced Advertising Platform. As more video content is served to multiple consumer devices, the ability to generate additional revenue by inserting advertising across multiple platforms becomes crucial to service providers seeking to offset content rights costs and reduce subscriber fees for viewing the content. Infusion enables service providers to maximize advertising revenue across multiscreen, broadcast, on-demand and OTT viewing and reach their audiences while viewers watch content across multiple devices. 
User Experience
 Nucleus. Nucleus ports to third-party set-top boxes, or other customer on-premises equipment hardware and system on a chip, and acts as a hub for all video distribution to any IP- connected device in the home, such as tablets, smart phones and game consoles.  SeaChange capitalizes on open software and networking technologies to offer Nucleus, a fully customizable foundation for rich multiscreen services running on the chipset and hardware. Nucleus enables the service providers to select the chipset, hardware and set-top box vendor of their choice. Nucleus extends providers’ video services to a wide range of video consumer devices through its support for Digital Living Network Alliance networking protocols. This enhances the overall offering by providing the framework for the introduction of new applications.  Further, Nucleus leverages the industry Reference Design Kit, a technology standard that enables the video service provider community to use open technologies to more rapidly introduce and support service innovations.
 SeaChange NitroX. NitroX empowers service providers and content owners to optimize live and on-demand video consumption on multiscreen and OTT services. Its features and functionality allow service providers to fully leverage the extensive content management, delivery and monetization capabilities of Seachange’s platforms. NitroX products provide a ready-to-deploy multiscreen user experience that is pre-integrated with SeaChange’s widely deployed Adrenalin or third-party multiscreen video platform and Nucleus.
 Services
 SeaChange offers comprehensive professional services, maintenance and support for all its products.  We have developed extensive capabilities in systems integration, implementation and customer engineering.  We also offer managed services with advantages,

including remote monitoring and proactive system maintenance, to help our customers quickly and confidently establish new on-demand and multiscreen capabilities.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We have focused and streamlined our research and development efforts in recent years. Our research and development costs were $23.2 million in fiscal 2018, $30.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $33.7 million in fiscal 2016. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new integrated solutions and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements in our current and future customer base as well as new markets. We have made substantial investments in developing and bringing to market our next generation products. Our current research and development activities are focused on developing multiscreen television platforms, content management solutions, additional user experience applications, advertising solutions and integrating the solutions we currently offer. Our direct sales and marketing groups closely monitor changes in customer needs, changes in the marketplace and emerging industry standards to help us focus our research and development efforts to address our customers’ needs, such as increasing average revenue per subscriber, lowering operating and capital costs and reducing customer churn. Our significant research and development efforts are performed at our Acton, Massachusetts headquarters, in Warsaw, Poland and in Eindhoven, Netherlands.  
 During fiscal 2018, we continued the focus of our research and development efforts on the next generation software platforms, which are vital to our customers’ success. We achieved this by further increasing our investment in our software products for multiscreen video platforms. As of January 31, 2018, we had a research and development staff of 104 full-time employees and 67 contract employees.   
 SELLING AND MARKETING 
 Our sales cycle tends to be long, in some instances 12-24 months, and purchase orders can be more than one million dollars. It is sometimes difficult to predict in what quarter or fiscal year our sales will occur. Considering the complexity of our video products, we primarily utilize a direct sales process. We sell and market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales organization and sales representatives and partners. Working closely with customers to understand and define their needs enables us to obtain better information regarding market requirements, enhance our expertise in our customers’ industries, and more effectively and precisely convey to customers how our solutions address their specific needs. 
 6


We use several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products. We also market certain of our products to systems integrators and value-added resellers. We attend and exhibit our products at a limited number of prominent industry trade shows and conferences and we present our technology at seminars and smaller conferences to promote their awareness. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, to increase software sales in North America and EMEA, we increased our sales efforts in those regions. We also increased our sales efforts in other geographic areas such as Asia Pacific and Latin America. As of January 31, 2018, we had a selling and marketing staff of 41 employees.
MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CONTROL
 Our manufacturing operation consists primarily of component and subassembly procurement, systems integration and final assembly, testing and quality control of the complete systems. As of January 31, 2018 we had a manufacturing staff of 4 employees, reflecting our transition to being a company that primarily provides software solutions.
OUR CUSTOMERS
 We currently sell our products primarily to video service providers, such as cable system operators and telecommunications companies, as well as content providers. Our customer base is highly concentrated among a limited number of large service provider customers. A significant portion of our revenues in any given fiscal period have been derived from substantial orders placed by these large organizations. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, LGI was the only customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. 
 We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues in the near future, even as we intend to penetrate new markets and customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders because of changes in customer requirements or new product announcements or introductions. In addition, the concentration of customers may cause variations in revenue, expenses and operating results on a quarterly basis due to seasonality of orders, the timing and relative size of orders received and accepted during a fiscal quarter, or the timing and size of orders for which revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied during a fiscal quarter.
 We do not believe that our backlog at any time is meaningful as an indicator of our future level of revenue for any specific future period. Because of the requirements of some customers, orders may require substantive acceptance criteria prior to revenue being recognized, resulting in the related revenues not being recognized in the ensuing quarter. Therefore, there is no direct correlation between the backlog at the end of any quarter and our total revenue for the following quarter or other periods. If our sales growth increases or we experience business model changes, our backlog may become a meaningful indicator of revenue in the future.
 COMPETITION 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by intense competition, with many suppliers providing different types of products to different segments of the markets. In new markets for our products, we compete based on price, functionality and delivery capabilities. In markets in which we have an established presence, we compete principally based on the breadth of our products’ features and benefits, including the flexibility, scalability, professional quality, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of our products, and our reputation and the depth of our expertise, customer service and support. While we believe that we currently compete favorably overall with respect to these factors and that our ability to provide integrated solutions to manage and distribute digital video differentiates us from our competitors, in the future we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors. 
 In the market for multiscreen video, we compete with various larger companies offering video platforms and applications such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Arris Group Inc., TiVo Corporation and Ericsson Inc., as well as in-house solutions built by the service provider. Increasingly, we are also seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions such as Comcast’s X-1 platform and many OTT providers. We expect the competition in each of the markets in which we operate to intensify in the future with existing and new competitors with significant market presence and financial resources.
 Many of our current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, these companies may introduce additional products that are competitive with ours or enter strategic relationships to offer complete solutions. Therefore, our products may not be able to compete effectively with these products from these companies in the future.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
 Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon the proprietary rights of our intellectual property. We have currently been granted 24 patents worldwide. In addition, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademark laws, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. It is possible that in the future, not all these patent applications will be issued or that, if issued, the validity of these patents would not be upheld. It is also possible that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be distributed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Currently, we are not party to intellectual property litigation, but we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others’ intellectual property.
EMPLOYEES
 The table below represents the number of full-time employees that we employ in different geographic areas across the world for the periods shown. We also use part-time and many other temporary employees in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by local works council as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions.

During fiscal 2017, we implemented costs-savings efforts related to the TLL, LLC (“Timeline Labs”) business and the DCC Labs acquisition. We implemented an additional company-wide cost savings program beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which included a worldwide reduction in workforce, to help improve operations and optimize our cost structure with the goal of restoring SeaChange to profitability and positive cash flow. In total, these actions affected more than 180 employees in fiscal 2018 and approximately 170 employees in fiscal 2017. Reductions in workforce relating to this latest cost-savings efforts are completed. 
 ACQUISITIONS AND LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT OF TLL, LLC
 DCC Labs
 On May 5, 2016, we acquired a 100% share of DCC Labs in exchange for an aggregate of $2.7 million in newly issued shares of SeaChange common stock and $5.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired, resulting in a total net purchase price of $7.9 million. The acquisition of DCC Labs enables us to optimize the operations of our In-Home business, which develops home video gateway software including SeaChange’s Nucleus and NitroX products. In addition, the acquisition brings market-ready products, including an optimized television software stack for Europe’s Digital Video Broadcasting community and an HTML5 framework for building additional user experience client applications across a variety of CPE devices, including Android TV STBs, tablets, mobile and computer devices. 
 We accounted for the acquisition of DCC Labs as a business combination, which requires us to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. The amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. We engaged an independent appraiser to assist management in assessing the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the acquisition date. Assets acquired in the acquisition include receivables, prepaid expenses and property and equipment while liabilities assumed include accounts payable, other accrued expenses, deferred taxes and income taxes payable. The amounts recorded for these assets and liabilities are final based on information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. 
 Loss on Impairment of TLL, LLC
 In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a restructuring plan to wind down the Timeline Labs operations, as previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 17, 2016. Based on the decision to enter into the restructuring plan and the plan’s impact on the projected future cash flows of the Timeline Labs operations, we determined that the 
 8


carrying amount of all long-term assets that resulted from the February 2015 acquisition had exceeded their fair value as of January 31, 2016. As a result, these long-term assets were deemed fully impaired and we recorded the $21.9 million net book value of these long-term assets as a component of loss on impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. Additionally, we reduced the contingent consideration liability associated with the Timeline Labs acquisition to zero, as we determined that the defined performance criteria would not be achieved, and credited the reversal of the liability of $0.4 million to loss on impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. In addition, we incurred $0.7 million in severance and other restructuring charges during fiscal 2017 related to cost-saving actions taken with respect to the Timeline Labs business.
