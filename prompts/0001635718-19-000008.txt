ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Gannett Co., Inc. (Gannett, we, us, our, or the company) is an innovative, digitally focused media and marketing solutions company committed to fostering the communities in our network and helping them build relationships with their local businesses. 
 Gannett owns ReachLocal, Inc. (ReachLocal), a digital marketing solutions company, the USA TODAY NETWORK (made up of USA TODAY (USAT) and 109 local media organizations in 34 states in the U.S. and Guam, including digital sites and affiliates), and Newsquest (a wholly owned subsidiary operating in the United Kingdom (U.K.) with more than 150 local media brands). Through the USA TODAY NETWORK and Newsquest, Gannett delivers high-quality, trusted content where and when consumers want to engage with it on virtually any device or platform. Additionally, the company has strong relationships with thousands of marketers in both our U.S. and U.K. markets due to our large local and national sales forces and a robust advertising and marketing solutions product suite. The company reports in two operating segments, publishing and ReachLocal, plus a corporate and other category. A full description of our segments is included in Note 14 — Segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The company has made both internal and external digital investments to align with the shift in spending habits to digital products by both consumers and marketers. In 2018, we acquired WordStream, Inc. (WordStream), a self-service, software-as-a-solution digital marketing services company that broadened our product suite and expanded our client base. In 2018, total digital revenues were $1.1 billion, or 36% of total company revenues. The USA TODAY NETWORK, with more than 3,200 journalists, averaged approximately 126 million(a) (see "References" section below) monthly unique visitors who access content through desktops, smartphones, and tablets. In November 2018, the company achieved a record 133 million(a) unique digital visitors in the U.S. In the U.K., Newsquest is a publishing and digital leader with approximately 800 journalists and a network of web sites that attracts over 25 million(b) unique visitors monthly.
Publishing Segment
Our publishing segment comprises the USA TODAY NETWORK (as described above) and Newsquest. Since its introduction in 1982, USA TODAY has been a cornerstone of the national news landscape and is a recognizable and respected brand. Through the execution of our business strategy since our spin-off, we have taken a series of steps that have culminated in the creation of the USA TODAY NETWORK.
•In 2015, we leveraged the strong USA TODAY brand and created the USA TODAY NETWORK, the largest local to national media network in the country, with full-scale content sharing capabilities across all sites. 
•In 2017, we started a branding refresh of our print and digital products across our U.S. markets with the goal to unify our digital network, modernize our visual storytelling, create a more contemporary look for our advertisers and partnerships, and attract new audiences. 
•In 2018, we completed the brand refresh and were recognized with several awards, including “Best Global New Print Product” as awarded by the International News Media Association. Additionally, the USA TODAY NETWORK was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes in 2018 for local reporting, editorial writing, and explanatory journalism, highlighting our ability to integrate in-depth reporting with cutting edge technology. We also expanded the size of our investigative journalism team and launched “The City,” named one of Apple's Best Podcasts in 2018.
•In 2018, we also launched LOCALiQ, our new data-driven, marketing solutions brand which packages together all of our advertising and marketing capabilities including products such as search engine marketing, display retargeting, location and reputation management, and website development.
The scale of our consumer audience across our publishing business makes us an attractive marketing partner to various national and local businesses trying to reach consumers. We are the leading newspaper publisher in the U.S. in terms of circulation and have the fourth largest digital audience in the News and Information category based on December 2018 Comscore Media Metrics; per those metrics, our content reaches more people digitally than Fox News, CBSnews.com, New York Times Digital, BuzzFeed.com, or WashingtonPost.com.(a)

•At our U.S. local publishing operations, the average daily print readership is approximately 11 million on Sundays and 5 million daily Monday through Saturday, while the digital audience averages nearly 45 million(a) unique visitors per month. At our flagship brand, USA TODAY, print readership averages over 1.6 million daily Monday to Friday, while the digital audience averages approximately 81 million(a) unique visitors per month. While our print audience tends to skew to an older demographic, our digital audience skews younger as evidenced by 47%(a) of the total U.S. digital millennial audience (ages 18 - 34) accessing USA TODAY NETWORK content monthly. 
•In the U.K., our wholly-owned subsidiary Newsquest has a total average print readership of over 8 million every week. Newsquest’s digital audience in 2018 had an average of 25.3 million(b) monthly unique users.
As digital media consumption shifts to mobile devices and social media, our audiences on these platforms continue to grow. The USA TODAY NETWORK consistently ranks in the top three in mobile web unique visitors in the News and Information category, finishing December 2018 at #1(a). Total mobile web page views for the USA TODAY NETWORK grew 10%(b) in December 2018, evidence our content successfully resonates on mobile devices. On social platforms, we focus on creating franchises to drive user engagement and had great success with our "Kind" brands (Animalkind, Humankind, and Militarykind). In 2018, the Kind brands produced 5.1 billion(c) video views and added more than 8.9 million followers. These results show that regardless of platform, our content drives engagement. At Newsquest, mobile monthly unique users also increased 1%(b) and mobile article page views grew 3%(b) in 2018 on a year-over-year basis. 
The publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and subscriptions to our print and digital publications and to a lesser extent commercial printing and distribution, marketing, and data services. USA TODAY and our local publications have developed an efficient operating model utilizing integrated shared support for back-office operations such as financial services and accounting, content design and layout services, print and digital creative development, and certain sales and service platforms. This model also serves as a point of leverage and synergy opportunity with respect to businesses acquired by the company. 
Advertising: In 2018, publishing segment advertising and marketing services revenues of $1.3 billion comprised 51% of total publishing segment revenues, down from 53% in 2017. We track our print advertising in three primary categories: local, national, and classified. Below are descriptions of the three categories:
•Local advertising is associated with local merchants or locally owned businesses. Ads run in our print products, such as our daily or non-daily publications, and are either run-of-press (ROP) or preprinted inserts (typically stand-alone, multiple page fliers inserted into daily and Sunday print products). 
•National advertising is principally associated with advertisers who are promoting national products or brands. Examples are retailers, commercial banks, airlines, and telecom. It also includes national brands that advertise in our local markets. Similar to local, ads are either ROP or preprints. 
•Classified advertising includes the major categories of automotive, employment, legal, and real estate/rentals. Advertising for classified segments is published in the classified sections or other sections within the publication and in certain magazines.
In 2018, we split our digital advertising and marketing services revenues into three main categories: digital media, digital classified, and digital marketing services. Below are descriptions of these three categories:
•Digital media represents all display advertising either delivered on our products or off-platform on partner channels such as Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News.
•Digital classified encompasses digital advertising revenues associated with our classified partnerships including auto (Cars.com) and employment (PandoLogic) as well as real estate, legal, and obituaries.
•Digital marketing services represents the suite of ReachLocal products being offered in our local markets as well as e-mail marketing.
2018 was a year of transition as we restructured and focused our local sales organization to better align with our customers based on level of spending and marketing objectives. In focusing our local sales organization, we categorized the retail teams into three main categories: metros/communities, strategics, and SMB (small and medium-sized business), with sales strategies tailored to individual client accounts rather than a “one size fits all" approach. We also centralized our pre-sales client solutions team and streamlined our post-sales operations, gaining efficiencies and improving post-sales reporting. In conjunction with the 
4

sales and post-sales reorganizations, in September 2018 we launched LOCALiQ, our go-to-market product solution brand that better packages our broad set of marketing solutions to enable a more consultative sale. In addition to our local sales organizations, we also have separate sales organizations that focus on the national, classified (employment and SMB classifieds), and auto categories, key categories utilizing unique sales approaches.
Our advertising teams employ a multi-platform approach to advertising sales, which can be specifically tailored to the individual needs of advertisers from small, locally-owned merchants to large, complex businesses. We believe local and national advertisers find it challenging to manage the complexity of their media budgets, particularly on the digital side, and are seeking to reach a shifting audience while also desiring to influence attitudes and behavior at each stage of the purchase path. Our diverse sales force, unique industry scale, and broad portfolio of print and digital products position us well to solve these challenges. Through our media planning process, we present advertisers with targeted, integrated solutions that help advertisers reach this shifting audience. To help improve the planning process and maximize our clients' return on investment, in the third quarter of 2018 we launched our “Grader” tool. Grader is a proprietary digital auditing technology that provides guidance, context, and recommendations around a business’ online marketing presence, including specific budgets with a defined set of outcomes that can be expected by the client. Grader combines smart insights and data intelligence to empower a business by comparing its digital presence to that of its competitors. The technology provides recommendations of marketing approaches without costly trial and error, leading to a much better and faster return on investment.
Our advertising revenues are subject to moderate seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising volumes. Our advertising revenues for publishing are typically highest in the company's fourth quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the first quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.
Circulation: In 2018, publishing segment circulation revenues of $1.1 billion comprised 42% of total publishing segment revenues, up from 40% in 2017. In a trend generally consistent within the domestic publishing industry, print circulation volumes declined in 2018. Circulation revenues in the U.S. are derived from our Full Access Content Subscription Model, single-copy sales, hotel sales, and digital-only subscriptions. Circulation revenues at Newsquest are more centered on single-copy sales with a larger portion of weekly paid-for titles and free titles as compared to our U.S. publications. Additionally, Newsquest employs a regional model, generally involving clustering products, which allows for the cross-selling of advertising serving the same or contiguous markets.
Our Full Access Content Subscription Model in our local markets includes access to our content via multiple platforms including websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-newspapers, with subscription prices that vary according to the frequency of delivery of the print edition. Also available to subscribers are digital only or digital plus Sunday subscriptions. We currently have approximately 1.8 million digital activated subscribers via our Full Access Content Subscription Model. We offer our customers EZ Pay, a payment system which automatically deducts subscription payments from customers' credit cards or bank accounts; we see better subscriber retention with our EZ Pay customers. At the end of 2018, EZ Pay was used by 60% of all subscribers at local U.S. Gannett sites (not including USA TODAY). 
Growing our digital-only subscribers is a strategic priority and, in 2018, our digital-only subscribers increased by 46% to approximately 504,000. Our primary digital subscriber acquisition strategies include on-site promotion, e-mail marketing, social marketing, and event marketing. A variety of pricing strategies are used throughout the year, including discounted introductory periods and sales, to encourage trial and habituation before transitioning to the full price rate. In the U.S. local markets, approximately 82% of circulation revenue is derived from our Full Access Content Subscription Model and digital-only subscriptions.
In addition to the subscription model in our U.S. local markets, single-copy print editions continue to be sold at retail outlets and account for approximately 11% of daily and 20% of Sunday net paid circulation volume. Approximately 77% of net paid circulation volumes of USA TODAY are generated by single-copy sales at retail outlets, vending machines, or hotels that provide copies to their guests. The remainder is generated by home and office delivery, mail, educational, and other sales. 
Production and Distribution: Gannett Publishing Services (GPS) was formed to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost associated with the production and distribution of the Gannett printed products across all divisions in the U.S. GPS manages the production and circulation operations for all our local daily and non-daily newspapers as well as USA TODAY and runs a commercial printing and delivery business that generates revenues from third party publishers. 
GPS leverages our existing assets, including employee talent and experience, physical plants and equipment, and our vast national and local distribution networks. GPS is particularly focused on maximizing our geographic footprint to most 
5

efficiently produce and transport our printed product. GPS is responsible for internal and external printing, packaging, and distribution. Over the last several years, GPS has actively outsourced printing activities to competitive local market or regional printing businesses in situations where the cost to outsource would benefit Gannett. Alternatively, in certain cases, GPS will utilize excess printing capacity to print competitor and other publications.
Newsquest operates its publishing activities in a similar manner to GPS, through regional centers to maximize the use of management, finance, printing, and personnel resources. This regional approach allows the business to leverage a variety of back-office and administrative activities to optimize financial results and enables the group to offer readers and advertisers a range of attractive products across the market.
Competition: Our U.S. and U.K. publishing operations and affiliated digital platforms compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Our publishing operations also compete for circulation and readership against other news and information outlets and amateur content creators. While very few of our publishing operations have similar daily print competitors that are published in the same city, our print products compete with the following types of businesses:
•National, regional and smaller suburban area newspapers and free or paid publications
•Other media including magazines, television, direct mail, cable television, radio, outdoor/billboard advertising, directories, e-mail marketing, web sites, mobile-device platforms, and social platforms. 
Development of opportunities in, and competition from, digital media, including web sites, tablet, mobile, and social products continues to increase. As such, there is very little barrier to entry and limited capital requirements for new companies to enter the market with competitive digital products. The company will continue to expand its audience reach in the digital media industry through internal audience development efforts, content distribution programs, acquisitions, and partnerships to protect its audience market share. Additionally, the company will continue to improve its suite of advertising and marketing services products through both internal development, acquisitions and partnerships to protect its advertising market share. 
Environmental Regulation: The company is committed to protecting the environment. Our goal is to ensure our production and distribution facilities comply with federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and to incorporate appropriate environmental practices and standards in our operations. We are one of the industry leaders in the use of recycled newsprint. During 2018, 17% of our domestic newsprint purchases contained recycled content, with average recycled content of 45%. 
Our operations use inks, solvents, and fuels. The use, management, and disposal of these substances are sometimes regulated by environmental agencies. We retain a corporate environmental consultant who, along with internal and outside counsel, oversees regulatory compliance and preventive measures. Some of our subsidiaries have been included among the potentially responsible parties in connection with sites that have been identified as possibly requiring environmental remediation, although we do not currently anticipate these designations will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
Raw Materials: Newsprint, which is the basic raw material used in our print publications, has been and may continue to be subject to significant price changes from time to time. For example, in the first half of 2018, many Canadian producers were subjected to significant anti-dumping and countervailing duties upon importation of newsprint into the U.S. which resulted in higher newsprint prices and tighter supply from the Canadian producers. Prices ultimately came down in the second half of the year as the duties were eliminated by the International Trade Commission in September 2018, but this example serves as a reminder of the price and supply volatility that can impact the market.

We purchase newsprint primarily from 14 domestic and global suppliers. During 2018, our total newsprint consumption was approximately 220,000 metric tons, including consumption by our owned and operated print sites, third-party printing sites, and Newsquest. Newsprint consumption in 2018 was 19% less than in 2017. We continue to moderate newsprint consumption and expense through the use of lighter basis weight paper. Our ability to supply the needs of our publishing operations depends upon the continuing availability of newsprint at an acceptable price, and the results of operations of our publishing segment may be impacted significantly by changes in newsprint prices. The availability and price of newsprint is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which are described more fully under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Joint Operating Agencies: Our publishing subsidiaries in Detroit and York each participate in a joint operating agency (JOA). In each instance, the JOA performs the production, sales, distribution, and back office functions for our subsidiaries and 
6

the publisher of another publication pursuant to a joint operating agreement. Operating results for the Detroit and York JOAs are fully consolidated along with a charge for the minority partner's share of profits. 
ReachLocal Segment
The mission of our ReachLocal segment is to deliver customers to local businesses. ReachLocal, Inc., which was founded in 2004 and acquired by Gannett in 2016, helps local businesses advertise online to find those customers. We believe local businesses want a single, unified solution to solve their digital marketing needs. Our total digital marketing solution consists of products and solutions in two categories: digital advertising (including search engine marketing, social advertising, and display advertising) and subscription solutions (including software solutions such as lead conversion software and field management software and presence solutions such as websites, search engine optimization, listings management, and live chat). In July 2018, Gannett acquired WordStream, a provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for local and regional businesses and agencies to optimize their digital advertising campaigns. WordStream’s solutions are included with our subscription solutions.
Products: Our digital advertising products are headlined by our search engine marketing (SEM) solution that combines search engine marketing optimized across multiple publishers, call tracking and call recording services, and industry leading campaign performance transparency. Our SEM offering is a leading product for local businesses and has won numerous awards since its rollout, including most recently winning Google's Quality Score Champion Award in North America. It is optimized for local markets in each of the locations in which our ReachLocal segment operates. Search engine marketing accounted for 67% of our ReachLocal segment’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
We also offer online advertising products focused on maximizing local businesses’ exposure by displaying their ads on websites that, in the aggregate, reach more than 90% of the U.S. online audience. We offer a Facebook advertising solution that incorporates our proprietary goal-based smart optimization. Our display products include a retargeting solution to target consumers who have previously visited a specific client's website through one of our digital advertising campaigns or who have previously searched for a client's keywords and other display products. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in ReachLocal's international markets.
In addition, we offer a number of subscription solutions. Our software solutions include our WordStream software and related services that enable our clients to optimize their own digital advertising campaigns ("do-it-yourself"). Our lead conversion software is a marketing automation platform that includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers for clients. We provide clients with tools designed to significantly improve their conversion of leads to customers and also help clients stay top-of-mind during the prospect's decision-making process by using integrated marketing automation to send new prospects targeted e-mails and alerts to the client's staff reminding them to follow up on each lead. Our lead conversion software also provides reports to show clients how many leads they are getting from each marketing source and other important business insights. Our field management solution is a cloud-based business management software for service businesses and allows us to provide an end-to-end solution to clients that starts with lead generation (e.g., digital advertising), includes lead conversion, and then closes and manages the business relationship. Our software solutions are available in North America and our lead conversion software is available in all of our markets.
Our subscription solutions also include presence solutions, including websites, search engine optimization, live chat, listings management, store locator, and other products and solutions, all focused on expanding and leveraging clients' web presence. Often, these products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing clients’ marketing return on investment. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in our international markets.
Distribution: We deliver our suite of products and solutions to local businesses through a combination of our proprietary technology platform, our sales force, and select third-party agencies and resellers. Our ReachLocal segment has sales operations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Approximately 82% of revenues are derived in North America and the remaining 18% from other international markets. All ReachLocal segment revenues are digital revenues.

Competition: The market for local online advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market is highly fragmented as there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services at highly competitive prices and, increasingly, we compete with vertical-specific SMB marketing providers who offer solutions tailored for specific verticals. In addition, the online publishers that we utilize for clients, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, generally offer their products and services through self-service platforms. Many traditional offline media companies also offer online advertising solutions and have large, direct sales forces and digital publishing properties. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.
Strategy
Gannett’s vision is to become essential to consumers and marketers seeking meaningful connections with their communities across print, digital and other channels. We are committed to a business strategy that drives audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our audience while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. The execution of this strategy should allow the company to continue its evolution from a more traditional print media business to a digitally focused media and marketing services business.
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Leverage nationwide scale and local presence to expand and deepen our relationships with consumers and marketers. The broad reach of both the USA TODAY NETWORK, with 109 local properties plus USA TODAY, and Newsquest, with more than 150 local media brands, gives us the ability to deepen our relationships with both consumers and advertisers at a national and local level. Through the USA TODAY NETWORK, we bring consumers the local news and information that impacts their day-to-day lives while keeping them informed of the national events that impact their country. To further drive audience growth and engagement across our domestic and international media brands, we will leverage the network to expand our content offerings to extend beyond news into new verticals, including lifestyle content such as food, health, and fitness. We intend to deepen our relationships with our subscribers by offering a membership model providing access to local events and experiences. For advertisers, we plan to leverage our broad sales footprint and strong customer relationships to aggressively expand our digital marketing services business into our local markets, both domestically and internationally. Given our extensive client base and volume of digital campaigns, we will also use data and insights to offer new and dynamic advertising products that can deliver superior results. 
Accelerate expansion of our digital businesses through innovative consumer experiences and new marketing solutions. In 2018, we continued the development of new consumer experiences through new storytelling platforms like podcasts as well as improving our digital products. We will continue to deepen overall engagement and drive audience growth in 2019 by further expanding our product offerings in these new mediums. During 2018, we further extended and scaled ReachLocal’s digital marketing offerings in our local markets. In 2019, we will continue to expand our digital marketing footprint through LOCALiQ as well as integrating WordStream’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) product offering. We will also continue to evolve our branded content offerings while building new and innovative ad products that will drive engagement for our local and national advertisers. 
Pursue opportunistic acquisitions. We are well-positioned to pursue value-enhancing investments and acquisitions while being both disciplined and opportunistic in our acquisition strategy. Our balance sheet remains strong and our cash flow generation capabilities provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities of various sizes. In 2018, our focus shifted from acquiring traditional print businesses to digital acquisitions that either expand our digital marketing services portfolio or broaden our content offerings. For example, we acquired WordStream, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider focused on the “do-it-yourself” category of the digital marketing services market, which added a new capability to the product portfolio of ReachLocal. We will still explore traditional print acquisitions that fit our geographic profile and offer strong synergy opportunities.
Maximize the value of our legacy print business and rationalize our cost base. We will continue to drive the profitability of our traditional print operations by rationalizing our cost infrastructure and maximizing our revenue base. To drive greater cost savings, we will continue to centralize operations to increase efficiencies with focus on our printing and distribution centers, content creation network, advertising sales and finance operations structure. Our economies of scale will enable us to continue to reduce supply chain costs while streamlining the process of producing newspapers. We will also explore outsourcing certain business functions to reduce costs. On the revenue side, we will implement new initiatives aimed at increasing our advertisers' return on investment while reducing our overall advertiser churn. Our circulation pricing strategy will center on strategic price increases while delivering greater value to our most loyal subscribers through membership opportunities.

 Maintain a flexible balance sheet with emphasis on capital allocation. Through aggressive cost management and disciplined financial policies, we have been able to maintain a strong balance sheet with relatively low debt levels compared to our peers. Our strong balance sheet has enabled us to keep a flexible capital allocation policy with an emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. Since the spin-off from our former parent, we have paid a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new three-year, $100 million share repurchase program in May 2018, replacing our initial program dated July 2015. As of December 31, 2018, 5.75 million shares have been repurchased under the legacy program at an average cost of $8.70 per share while no shares have been repurchased under the new plan. 
Strategic Acquisitions
WordStream, Inc. (WordStream): In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of WordStream. WordStream provides software that enables SMBs to optimize the performance of marketing campaigns on Google, Facebook, and other major advertising platforms through a variety of software-as-a-service (SaaS) product offerings.

ReachLocal offers online marketing, digital advertising, software-as-a-service, and web presence products and solutions to small and medium-sized businesses. It delivers its suite of products and solutions to local businesses through a combination of its proprietary technology platform, its sales force, and select third-party agencies and resellers.
North Jersey Media Group, Inc. (NJMG): In July 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of NJMG. NJMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving primarily the northern New Jersey market. Its brands include such established names as The Record (Bergen County) and The Herald. 
Journal Media Group, Inc. (JMG): In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of JMG. JMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving 15 U.S. markets in nine states, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Knoxville News Sentinel, and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. The acquisition expanded our print and digital publishing operations domestically.
History
Our newspaper business was founded by Frank E. Gannett and associates in 1906 and incorporated in 1923. We were separated from our former parent on June 29, 2015 when our former parent distributed 98.5% of the outstanding shares of Gannett common stock (also referred to herein as the spin-off or separation) to its stockholders on a pro rata basis. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GCI and are headquartered in McLean, VA near Washington, DC.
Employees
We employed approximately 13,700 persons at our subsidiaries in the U.S. as of December 31, 2018. Approximately 14% of those employed by us in the U.S. are represented by labor unions, most of which are affiliated with one of seven international unions. These represented employees are covered by approximately 29 collective bargaining agreements. These agreements conform generally with the pattern of labor agreements in the publishing industry. We do not engage in industry-wide or company-wide bargaining. Our U.K. subsidiaries bargain with two unions over working practices, wages, and health and safety issues only. There were approximately 3,280 employees outside of the U.S., including approximately 2,600 employed by Newsquest in the U.K.
