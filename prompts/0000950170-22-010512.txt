 Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
History and Significant Events
 Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc.
 In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.
 In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations.
 In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units.
 In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market.
 In fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.
 We converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022.
 Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate

with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship.
 Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and maintenance agreements, and professional services.
 Products, Support and Professional Services
 We are a leading developer and marketer of software-enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions.
 We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories:
 •Products (hardware and software)
 •Support, maintenance and subscription services
 •Professional services
 Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows:
 

 | Year ended March 31, | 
(In thousands) | 2022 | | 2021 | | | 2020
Products | $ | 35,956 | | $ | 26,714 | | $ | 44,230 
Support, maintenance and subscription services | | 98,958 | | | 88,565 | | | 83,680 
Professional services | | 27,722 | | | 21,897 | | | 32,847 
Total | $ | 162,636 | | $ | 137,176 | | $ | 160,757

 
Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’ ability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases.
Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting end-to-end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.
 Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money.
 Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions:
 The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated “platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage functions, including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem.


Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, optimize staff efficiency, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey – from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions.
 With our omni-channel suite of software products, we are uniquely positioned to offer solutions that allow customers to adhere to social distancing guidelines, offer contactless solutions at every point of the guest journey, and maximize operational efficiency all while providing an improved guest experience.
Point of Sale (POS) Solutions:
 Agilysys POS solution suite allows customers to provide their guests with an omni-channel experience within their property. Guests are empowered to create their own experiences through ordering from a mobile device or walking up to a self-service kiosk, but also providing for a more traditional experience with staff by interacting with a cashier or bar, or having a server come to them. Irrespective of the channel of interaction for the guest, our POS suite provides a single integrated enterprise-grade back-office management system with robust reporting capabilities. This allows our customers to manage menus, price changes, purchasing trends, inventory management and sales reporting from a single integrated source providing for increased efficiency as well as providing a richer guest profile.
 

Agilysys InfoGenesis® POS is an award-winning point of sale solution that combines a fast, intuitive and highly customizable terminal application with powerful, flexible reporting and configuration capabilities in the back office management portal. The system is easy to set up, and its scalable architecture enables customers to add workstations without having to build out expensive infrastructure.

InfoGenesis POS is available as a cloud-based or on-premise solution.

Agilysys IG KDS is a digital kitchen management solution that integrates with InfoGenesis, IG Buy® Kiosk and IG OnDemand to deliver staff and customer-originated orders to the kitchen for preparation. Custom attributes such as guest phone number, name, guest location or packaging instructions can be provided on each incoming order so the order can be fulfilled promptly to guests. Guests can optionally be notified of order completion via an order status monitor (OSM) or via text message.
 


Agilysys IG Buy is an enterprise-class self-service, customer-facing kiosk point of sale solution for the hospitality industry. It is ideal for food & beverage venues such as buffets, grab ‘n go, corporate cafeterias and food courts.

IG Buy Kiosk is currently deployed at more than 270 customer sites across the country, including corporate cafeterias at a top five U.S. bank, a top 40 U.S. law firm, one of the nation’s largest technology manufacturers, and at a national financial services firm.
 Agilysys IG Buy’s intuitive guest-facing order and pay experiences transfer the control and convenience to the end user. The self-service components reduce on-site labor needed to manage venue operations, while improving guest throughput, check size, order accuracy, guest experience and satisfaction. The platform-driven and cloud-based solution allows for easy deployments and management at scale resulting in a lowered overall cost of ownership.
 

Agilysys IG OnDemand provides a visual, interactive food and beverage ordering experience to any mobile device – phone, tablet, laptop – with a browser-based self-service experience. Using a simple, intuitive interface, guests can easily order and reorder from anywhere across the property, driving order velocity and volume.
 Agilysys IG OnDemand allows our customers to immediately offer an online ordering platform that is natively integrated with their physical location operations. Menus and price updates can be done in one place and automatically updated across all channels – online web store, digital menus and app ordering as well as POS terminals. Orders placed online are routed automatically to the appropriate kitchen for preparation. Orders placed from all channels are automatically available on the POS terminal at the physical location.
 
Agilysys IG OnDemand Full Service is a complete contactless self-service F&B ordering solution that offers an intuitive guest-facing order and pay experience. IG OnDemand allows guests to place and pay for orders using their own device - phone, tablet, laptop – for pick-up or delivery orders, as well as for a tableside order and pay experience. It supports ordering for multiple guests at a table over the course of a meal using their own devices making the ordering process touchless while freeing up staff to spend more time with guests. The result is dramatically increased revenue opportunities and more chances to enhance guest service.
 
Agilysys IG Quick Pay allows guests to use their own mobile device, scan a QR code on the InfoGenesis check, review a digital copy of the check, add a tip & initiate payment, maintaining a fully touchless guest payment experience. The product can be sold as a standalone payment solution or can be bundled with IG OnDemand for a complete order and pay experience.
 
Agilysys IG Smart Menu provides a touchless menu display on a guest’s own mobile device - phone, tablet, laptop. Simply scan a QR code to access a venue menu that is linked directly to the actual items available in the IG OnDemand system, not a pdf or a website link. The product can be sold as a standalone menu solution or can be bundled with IG OnDemand for a complete menu, order and pay experience.
 
Agilysys IG Digital Menu Board provides large screen menu and image display on commercial television monitors. It will display a venue menu that is linked directly to the actual items available in the IG OnDemand system, not a pdf or a website link, so it can easily reflect the latest items and pricing.

 Virtual Check-in and Check-out Solutions
 Today’s hotels cater to guests with high expectations when it comes to technological efficiency. An emerging trend in the hotel industry that has accelerated in the COVID-19 environment where social distancing is often the norm, is the ability for guests to check themselves in or out of their room without interacting with the front desk. To that end, we offer software modules that enable this approach and are fully integrated with our core PMS solutions.
Point of Sale and Property Management Ecosystem Offerings:
 The following solutions integrate with and are complementary to our point of sale or property management systems, or both. These solutions, for the most part, can stand alone and do not require POS or PMS to be functional.

Industry and Markets
 We are a technology software solutions company exclusively focused on the hospitality industry. Our products have been enabling mission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the hospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for our customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following hospitality verticals: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA.
 Some verticals we serve continue to face uncertainties with the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people receive vaccinations and pandemic-related restrictions continue to ease, the markets we serve are recovering and re-opening to their customers. The long-term outlook remains strong and we expect the momentum from the three years preceding the pandemic to continue building with a growing focus on social distancing and mobile applications. Prior to COVID-19, we estimated our total addressable market to be approximately $4.8 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it is still in the billions of dollars and we are only a fraction of that size. We continue to feel good about our opportunity to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry.
Customers
 Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly fragmented.
Human Capital
 As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 1,400 employees, with approximately 63%, 30%, 3%, 3%, and 1% of our employees located in India, the United States, APAC, Canada, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success.
 Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success.
 We are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We make all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. All employees, directors, independent contractors, and other parties who work with Agilysys are expected to create a working environment where everyone is respected, regardless of individual differences. We believe that each of our employees' individual character, virtues, and individual experiences will leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers.
 Seasonality
 Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results.
Competition
 Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service.
 We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support, subscription and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., Shiji,

Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies like Maestro. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.
 Environmental Matters
 We believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.
Access to Information
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our corporate website, http://www.agilysys.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

 Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Risks Relating to Our Business
 Markets, Competition, and Operations
 Our business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions.
 Because we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services.
 For example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed below under “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time,” our performance has been affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be further materially affected going forward if these conditions continue for an additional extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities.
 Similarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.
 COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time.
 The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. Even as these restrictions have been relaxed in many parts of the world, including across the United States, they remain effective in other parts of the world and have frequently been re-imposed in many locations after having been relaxed as a result of additional outbreaks. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate foodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadiums and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers’ businesses. Business closures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue.
 We saw an improvement in the overall business environment and the hospitality market we serve during the second half of our fiscal 2021 (the year ended March 31, 2021) that continued through our fiscal 2022 as our customers re-opened their locations for business and our suppliers resumed operations that had been closed or reduced due to the pandemic. Based on the improved business

environment and our financial performance, we have resumed certain levels of spending; however, we will continue to assess spending activity as the facts and circumstances surrounding the pandemic evolve. Any resulting cost controls may have an adverse impact on our business, particularly if they remain in place for an extended period. As the pandemic has evolved, we have also adapted our pandemic response based on the conditions of the locations in which we and our customers and suppliers operate. We expect to incur additional costs to the extent we further resume business-related travel and our employees return to our office locations, the timing and extent of which remains undetermined at this time. We expect the office activity will vary significantly from region to region based on factors such as the availability of vaccines and the spread and overall impact of any new virus variants.
 Notwithstanding the recovery in the business environment since the early part of the pandemic, given the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, our ability to predict how it will impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results in future periods is limited.
 Our business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes.
 We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.
Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance.
 Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
 The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:
 •Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;
 •Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and
 •Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices.
 Our product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments.
If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
 We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.
 Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future.
 We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or

services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity.
 Our future success depends on our ability to execute on growth or strategic initiatives, properly manage investments in our business and operations, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure.
 Our success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth or strategic initiatives we are pursuing. A key element of our long-term strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions.
 Investments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, R&D, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are critical components for achieving this strategy. In particular, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in research and development may result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate.
 However, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful (financially or otherwise), especially in new areas in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term. To be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment funds and other resources, prioritize among opportunities, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new areas and the servicing of our existing customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with the new solutions, in which we have invested.
 Our success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure, systems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new implementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems during or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting.
 If we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.
 Our dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them.
 We rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins.
 For certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant risk exposure for us.
 We maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other cloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these providers with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If these third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other difficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs, potential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially adversely impact our business.
 We also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our competitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be smaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in an effort to benefit our margins.
If any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any other disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a

competitor, macroeconomic issues like those described above (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to internally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce our service levels, any of which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we strive to establish contractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our relationship with a key provider is interrupted.
 If we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if labor costs continue to rise, our ability to operate and grow our business may be impaired and our financial results may suffer.
 We depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we must retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry challenge given the competitive technology labor market, especially with the remote work options brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our workforce to execute on new and larger opportunities and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in technology areas. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in trending market sectors. Remote employment arrangements also come with challenges, including with respect to collaboration, training, and corporate culture, especially at a significant scale. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel when and where they are needed or to manage effectively our remote workforce, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected.
 While the market for talent in our industry has been competitive for many years, in recent quarters, the labor market has become even tighter, increasing the difficulty and lead time in filling open positions with qualified candidates. Ongoing labor shortages or increasing labor costs could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, especially if rising costs outpace our revenue growth.
 Our international operations have many associated risks.
We continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.
 We have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic instability abroad.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business.
 Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our employees throughout the world have been capable of working from home for months at a time without significantly impacting our business. However, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers.


Regulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality
 Cyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers.
The number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers and ultimately, our business.
 These events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers.
 Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities.
 Our software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and implementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers’ systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our software can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software, our business could be adversely affected.
 We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology.


We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.
 Third parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
While we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement.
 If we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability.
 Our ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers’ businesses.
 In addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability.
 Risks Relating to the Industries We Serve
 Our business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 Because our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of that industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time” above for additional information.
 Consolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business.
 Customers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
 Insolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business.
 Customers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their

lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected.
Risks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure
 If we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits.
 As part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects.
 We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
 Some of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.
 We may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results.
 As of March 31, 2022, we had $32.8 million and $20.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March 31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and cash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future.
 We have incurred losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future.
 We have incurred operating losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our products. Our lack of consistent profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product upgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations.
 Our stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.
 Our stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2022, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $58.45 to a low close of $35.31. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:
 •uncertainties the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for the global economy;
 •economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets;
 •our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;
 •announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;
 •our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; and
 •any major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.


On May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Dilution upon the conversion of the preferred stock in the future may negatively impact the price of our common stock.
 Additionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time.
 We may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances.
 While we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any.
 Other Risk Factors
 We are subject to litigation, which may be costly.
 As a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business.
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
 While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
