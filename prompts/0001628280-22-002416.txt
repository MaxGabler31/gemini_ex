Item 1. Business
Overview
ON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, which operate under the onsemiTM brand ("onsemi," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1992. 
We provide industry leading intelligent sensing and power solutions to help our customers solve the most challenging problems and create cutting edge products for a better future. Our intelligent power technologies enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems. Our intelligent sensing technologies, supports the next generation industry allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible. 
onsemi’s intelligent power allows our customers to exceed range targets with lower weight and reduce system cost through efficiency. With our sensing integration, we believe onsemi’s intelligent power solutions achieve higher efficiencies compared to our peers and allows lower temperature operation, reducing cooling requirements, saving costs and minimizing weight while delivering the required power with less die per module and achieving higher range for a given battery capacity. onsemi’s intelligent sensing solutions offer proprietary features in smaller packages that support customers' use cases. We believe our intelligent sensing technology offers advanced features to achieve optimal results and our product integration drives improved efficiency. This performance is delivered in a smaller footprint while reducing system latency to increase safety and throughput by providing a proprietary feature set to solve different use cases.
We serve a broad base of end-user markets, including automotive, industrial and others which include communications, computing and consumer. We believe the evolution of automotive with advancements in autonomous driving, ADAS, vehicle electrification, and the increase in electronics content for vehicle platforms is reshaping the boundaries of transportation. With our extensive portfolio of AEC-qualified products, onsemi helps customers design high reliability solutions while delivering top performance. And within the industrial space, onsemi is helping OEMs develop innovative products to navigate the ongoing transformation across energy infrastructure, factory automation and power conversion.
As of December 31, 2021, we were organized into the following three operating and reportable segments: the Power Solutions Group ("PSG"), the Advanced Solutions Group ("ASG") and the Intelligent Sensing Group ("ISG").
Business Strategy Developments
Our primary focus continues to be on gross margin and operating margin expansion, while at the same time achieving revenue growth in our focused end-markets of automotive, industrial and communications infrastructure as well as being opportunistic in other end-markets, including obtaining longer-term supply arrangements with strategic end-customers. We are also focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating expenditures. While we believe we have made significant progress on gross margin and operating margin expansion, we continue to rationalize our product portfolio and have allocated capital, research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products and end-markets by moving away from non-differentiated products, which have had historically lower gross margins. To this effect, onsemi is exploring the sale of select manufacturing facilities. As actions are initiated to achieve our business strategy goals, we could incur accounting charges in the future. 
We believe these actions, among others, will allow us to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model where our financial performance will be less volatile and not as heavily influenced by our internal manufacturing volumes. We will continue to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in 2022 to align with our investment priorities and corporate strategy. Our goal is to reduce volatility in our gross margins and maximize return on our manufacturing investments with the intention of having our product strategy drive our manufacturing footprint and capital investments.
In order to streamline our operations and achieve efficiencies, we implemented an involuntary severance plan during 2021, under which approximately 960 employees were notified of their employment termination and we incurred severance and related charges of $65.3 million. We continue to evaluate employee positions and locations for potential efficiencies and may incur additional severance and related charges in the future.
We are focused on sustainability as we drive a common theme across all markets. In August 2020, onsemi announced its commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040. As we initiate steps to achieve our sustainability goals, additional investments may be required in the future in connection with such actions, although the timing and amounts of such investments are uncertain at this time.
Completed and Pending Acquisitions and Divestitures
On October 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of GT Advanced Technologies Inc. ("GTAT"), a producer of SiC. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the purchase price for the acquisition was $434.9 million, which included cash consideration of $424.6 million and effective settlement of pre-acquisition balances (non-cash) of approximately $10 million, in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests of GTAT. We believe the GTAT acquisition will act as a building block to fuel growth and accelerate innovation in disruptive intelligent power technologies and secure supply of SiC to meet rapidly growing customer demand for SiC-based solutions in the sustainable ecosystem.
On October 1, 2021, we divested one of our businesses along with the related intellectual property for aggregate consideration of approximately $13.6 million and recognized a gain on sale of $10.2 million after offsetting the carrying values of the disposed assets and liabilities.
During 2019 and 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "APA") and an Asset Purchase Agreement Amendment (the "APA Amendment") to acquire GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc.'s ("GFUS") East Fishkill, New York site and fabrication facilities and certain other assets and liabilities on or around December 31, 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments as described in the APA and the APA Amendment (the "Total Consideration"). We paid GFUS $70.0 million and $100.0 million during 2019 and 2020, respectively, of the Total Consideration in cash as a non-refundable deposit, which will be applied toward and reduce the Total Consideration. 
See Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Impact of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") Pandemic on our Business
In response to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry, we have proactively implemented preventative protocols, which we continuously assess and update for current local conditions and emerging trends. These are intended to safeguard our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers and communities and to ensure business continuity in case of further government restrictions or if severe outbreaks impact operations at certain of our facilities. While substantially all of our global manufacturing sites are currently operational, our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates in response to further outbreaks or new variants of COVID-19. We are still unable to predict the ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations.
Revenue-Generating Activities
onsemi generates revenue from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors and direct customers. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis.
As many of our products are sold into different end-markets, the total revenue reported under PSG, ASG and ISG is not indicative of actual sales in the end-market associated with that segment, but rather is the sum of the revenue from the product lines assigned to that segment. From time to time, we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices to our operating segments and may move product families or individual devices from one operating segment to another.
The following table illustrates the product technologies under each of our segments based on our operating strategy:

PSG | ASG | ISG 
Analog products | Analog products | Actuator Drivers 
SiC products | ASIC products | CMOS Image Sensors 
Discrete products | Connectivity products | Image Signal Processors
MOSFET Products | ECL products | LSI products 
Power Module products | Foundry products / services | Single Photon Detectors
Isolation products | Gate Driver products | Sensors 
Memory products | LSI products | 
Gate Driver products | Standard Logic products | 
Standard Logic products | | 
WBG products | | 

Products and Technology
The following provides certain information regarding the products and technologies for each of our operating segments. See Note 3: ''Revenue and Segment Information'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for other information regarding our segments, their revenue and property, plant and equipment and the gross profit derived from each segment.
PSG
PSG offers a wide array of analog, discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products that perform multiple application functions, including power switching, power conversion, signal conditioning, circuit protection, signal amplification and voltage regulation functions. The trends driving growth within our end-user markets are primarily higher power efficiency and power density in power applications, the demand for greater functionality, and faster data transmission rates in all communications. The advancement of existing volt electrical infrastructure, electrification of power train in the form of EV/HEV, higher trench density enabling lower losses in power efficient packages and lower capacitance and integrated signal conditioning products to support faster data transmission rates significantly increase the use of high power semiconductor solutions. The recent increase in the use of WBG MOSFETs and diodes, including SiC and IGBT, is further expanding the use of semiconductor products. 
ASG
ASG designs and develops analog, mixed-signal, advanced logic, ASSPs and ASICs, RF and integrated power solutions for a broad base of end-users in different end-markets. Our product solutions enable industry leading active mode and standby mode efficiency now demanded by regulatory agencies around the world. Additionally, ASG offers trusted foundry and design services for our government customers which leverages the Company’s broad range of manufacturing, IC design, packaging, and silicon technology offerings to provide turn-key solutions for our customers. 
ISG
ISG designs and develops CMOS image sensors, image signal processors, single photon detectors, including SiPM and SPAD arrays, as well as actuator drivers for autofocus and image stabilization for a broad base of end-users in the different end-markets. Our broad range of product offerings delivers excellent pixel performance, sensor functionality and camera systems capabilities in which high quality visual imagery is becoming increasingly important to our customers and their end-users, particularly in automotive and factory automation and in applications powered by AI. 
Customers
We sell our products to distributors and direct customers for ultimate use in a variety of end-products in different end-markets. In general, we have maintained long-term relationships with our key customers and our sales agreements are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. During 2021, we entered into a number of long-term supply arrangements with certain strategic end-customers, which generally include minimum purchase commitments. Pricing terms on product development agreements are negotiated at the beginning of a project. Almost all of our contracts have default provisions, and certain of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at 
any time for convenience of the contracting agency.
We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Our standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery, except in the case of image sensor products, which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with our customers, they may cancel orders 120 days prior to shipment for standard products without penalty and, for custom products, prior to shipment, provided they pay onsemi's actual costs incurred as of the date we receive the cancellation notice. The loss of one of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment, and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
Distributors
Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 64% of our revenue in 2021, 60% of our revenue in 2020 and 57% of our revenue in 2019. We had one distributor whose revenue accounted for approximately 13% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our distributors resell to mid-sized and smaller OEMs and other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.
Direct Customers
Sales to direct customers, which include manufacturers who provide contract manufacturing services for OEMs, accounted for approximately 36% of our revenue in 2021, 40% of our revenue in 2020 and 43% of our revenue in 2019. Large multi-nationals and selected regional OEMs, which are significant in specific markets, form our core direct customers. Generally, these customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty.
For additional information regarding agreements with our customers, see "Markets," "Resources" and "Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and Note 2: "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Competition

We face significant competition from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because some of our components include functionality that in some cases may be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:
PSG 
Our competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading edge fabrication technologies, micro packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high quality cost effective manufacturing and supply chain management which ensures supply to our customers. Our commitment to continual innovation allows us to provide an ever broader range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency, the key performance characteristics driving our markets.
The principal methods of competition in our discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products are through new products and package innovations enabling enhanced performance over existing products. Of particular importance are our power MOSFETs, IGBTs, WBG MOSFETs and diodes, including SiC rectifiers and power module portfolio for power conversion applications, and ESD portfolio for hi-speed serial interface protection products, where we believe we have significant performance advantages over our competition. PSG's competitors include: Broadcom Limited ("Broadcom"), Diodes Incorporated, Infineon Technologies AG ("Infineon"), Wolfspeed, Nexperia BV, Rohm Semiconductor USA LLC ("Rohm"), Semtech Corporation, STMicroelectronics N.V. ("STMicroelectronics"), Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI"), Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

ASG principally competes on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel. Our competitive position with respect to the above basis is enhanced by long-standing relationships with leading direct customers.
Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing 
yields and availability of supply, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Competitors for certain of ASG's products and solutions include: Infineon, NXP Semiconductors N.V. ("NXP"), STMicroelectronics and TI.
ISG
ISG differentiates itself from the competition through deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive leading edge sensing performance for both human and machine vision applications. ISG has significant imaging experience and was one of the earliest to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors and introduce CMOS technology in many of our markets. ISG has leveraged this expertise into market leading positions in automotive and industrial applications, which allows us to offer technical and end-user applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative sensing solutions across a broad range of end-user needs. 
Competitors for certain of ISG's products and solutions include: Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Omnivision, STMicroelectronics, Rohm, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Broadcom.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We have global distribution centers in China, the Philippines and Singapore. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers' needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers, allowing for applications that are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions.
Backlog
Our sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are booked as far as 52 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped in the current or future period. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. During 2021, our backlog for shipments requested for a given quarter exceeded actual revenue during such quarter. 

In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Historically, a significant portion of our backlog was cancellable, however, under our current agreements, including orders subject to minimum purchase commitments under our longer-term supply arrangements, are not subject to cancellation. See "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" located elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the inventory practices within the semiconductor industry.
Resources
Raw Materials
Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, SiC wafers, laminate substrates, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources, generally on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we continue to experience some supply constraints due to the current conditions, we could face further shortages in various essential materials as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand in the industry or other factors.

See Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K regarding the pending acquisition of a manufacturing facility in 2022. 
We operate all of our existing manufacturing facilities directly, except our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests ("Leshan"). The financial and operating results of Leshan have been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner in Leshan, Leshan Radio Company Ltd. ("Leshan Radio"), is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement between us and Leshan Radio, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment, provided that any shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We purchased 80% of Leshan's production capacity in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan's expected production capacity in 2022.
We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These manufacturers collectively accounted for approximately 37% of our total manufacturing input costs in 2021, 33% in 2020 and 31% in 2019.
For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see "Risk Factors —Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We market our products under worldwide trademarks including the ON Semiconductor, ON, onsemi, and various product names and logos, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our IP. We acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous U.S. and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. As of December 31, 2021, we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2040, and none of the patents that expire in the next three years materially affect our business. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. 
Seasonality
We believe our business today is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality, as was the case historically. Our 2021 results were positively influenced by macroeconomic factors including a better-than-expected economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic along with our efforts focused on price increases, better utilization, product diversification and content gains. We could again experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or macroeconomic conditions. For information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business, see "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, with respect to such matters, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines.
We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable environmental regulations for the year ended December 31, 2021 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, together with any liabilities for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures or earnings or our competitive position. It is possible, however, that future developments, including 
changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. See Note 13: ''Commitments and Contingencies'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters.
We are also subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, trade barriers, trade embargoes, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act ("ITAR"), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Additionally, U.S. or China governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could impact our operations.
We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable trade regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, ITAR, FCPA, the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, and similar applicable laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable trade regulations for the year ended December 31, 2021 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing trade laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures or earnings or our competitive position. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations or government policies, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. For information regarding risks associated with import-export control regulations and similar applicable laws and regulations, see "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

We have organization level and overall Company metrics to monitor for diverse director-level and above employees, diverse new hires and diverse promotions. Our Human Resources organization and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"), through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workflow equity and workplace inclusion. 
Compensation, Benefits, Health, Safety and Wellness
Our compensation philosophy is focused on delivering total rewards based on corporate affordability in a way that enables attraction, retention, and recognition of performance delivered in an equitable manner. We provide our employees and their families with access to flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that secure them during events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being. Our primary focus during the COVID-19 pandemic has been protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We use a combination of total rewards and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract and retain our employees, including: annual performance bonuses; stock awards, including an employee stock purchase plan; retirement support; healthcare and insurance benefits; business travel and disability insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; flexible work schedules, vacation and paid time off; parental leave; paid counseling assistance; backup child and adult care; education assistance; and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers.
Career Growth and Development
We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee motivation, performance and improving retention. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have established a leadership pathway model as a tool for employees to practice and apply learning as part of their development.
Turnover
We monitor employee turnover rates by region and the Company as a whole. The average tenure of our employees is approximately seven years and approximately one-fifth of our employees have been employed by us for more than 10 years. We believe our compensation philosophy along with the career growth and development opportunities promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover.
