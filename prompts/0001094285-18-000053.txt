Customers
We have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve. No commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of any segment net sales, during 2017, 2016 or 2015. No commercial customer in 2017, 2016 or 2015 accounted for more than 3.0% of total net sales.
Sales to international customers accounted for approximately 46% of total sales in 2017, compared with 43% in 2016 and 44% in 2015. In 2017, we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries. Approximately 90% of our sales to foreign-based customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries. In 2017, the top five countries for international sales were China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and South Korea and constituted approximately 21% of our total sales.
Approximately 24%, 27% and 26% of our total sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):

U.S. Government sales by segment: | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Instrumentation | $ | 65.2 | | | $ | 74.4 | | $ | 61.2 
Digital Imaging | 85.6 | | | 73.1 | | | 78.9 
Aerospace and Defense Electronics | 225.0 | | | 210.4 | | | 223.5
Engineered Systems | 243.9 | | | 219.8 | | | 234.4
Total U.S. Government sales | $ | 619.7 | | | $ | 577.7 | | $ | 598.0

Our principal U.S. Government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense. These sales represented 18%, 21% and 19% of our total sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In both 2017 and 2016, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Mission Operations and Integration contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center which represented 1.5% of our total sales in both years. In 2015, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Engineering Solutions and Prototyping contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, which represented 1.5% of our total sales. 
As described under risk factors, there are risks associated with doing business with the U.S. Government. In 2017, approximately 58% of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed-price type contracts, compared to 54% in 2016 and 54% in 2015. Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. Such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance. Additionally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government at its convenience, without identification of any default. When contracts are terminated for convenience, we recover costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. We had nine U.S. Government contract terminated for convenience in 2017, compared with one in 2016 and eight in 2015.
Our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $1,250.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $916.4 million at January 1, 2017, and $802.8 million at January 3, 2016. We expect to fulfill 93% of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2018. The increase in total backlog in 2017 primarily reflects backlog related to e2v, which was acquired in 2017.

Generally, our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials, but not without some price volatility. While some of our businesses provide services, for those businesses that sell hardware and product, a portion of the value that we provide is labor-oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors, including international sources. Some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products, including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications, certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes, certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems, as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our X-ray detectors, are purchased from limited or single sources, including international sources, due to technical capability, price and other factors. At times we have experienced difficulty in procuring raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes due to shortages and supplier imposed allocation of components.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments. A shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs, with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longer-term relationships.
Our segments use a combination of internal sales forces, third-party distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services. Our Teledyne Instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts. Several Teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “one-stop” shopping under singular “brand” names, including Teledyne Marine, Teledyne Oil & Gas, Teledyne Water Quality, Teledyne Microwave Solutions, Teledyne HiRel Electronics and Teledyne Advanced Chemistry Systems.
Products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites. To promote our products and other capabilities, our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations.
Many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing.
Through Teledyne Technologies International Corp. and other subsidiaries, we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses. Locations include Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.
Competition
We believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete. Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive. With regard to our defense businesses, it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among a number of companies, including competitors. In any event, because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields. We incurred a total of $508.4 million in 2017, $458.3 million in 2016 and $476.6 million in 2015 on research and development and bid and proposal costs. Customer-funded research and development, most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the U.S. Government, represented approximately 65%, 63% and 66% of total research and development and bid and proposal costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In 2017, we incurred $177.7 million in Company-funded research and development and bid and proposal costs. We expect the level of Company-funded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately $180.0 million in 2018.
Intellectual Property
While we own and control various intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties. We own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. Similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents, patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Employees
We consider our relations with our employees to be good. At December 31, 2017, our total workforce consisted of approximately 10,340 employees, of which approximately 6,760 employees were located in the United States.

 * Such officers are subject to the reporting and other requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Dr. Robert Mehrabian and Teledyne are parties to a Fifth Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated as of October 22, 2013, which was amended on September 28, 2015. Under the amended agreement, we will employ Dr. Mehrabian as the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Teledyne through December 31, 2019, at an annual base salary that is currently $995,000. The agreement provides that Dr. Mehrabian is entitled to participate in Teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan (“AIP”) and other executive compensation and benefit programs. The agreement provides Dr. Mehrabian with a non-qualified pension arrangement, under which Teledyne will pay him annually starting six months following his retirement and for a period of 10 years, as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan, an amount equal to 50% of his base compensation as in effect on retirement.
Ten current members of management have entered into change of control severance agreements. The agreements have a three-year, automatically renewing term, except as noted below. The executive is entitled to severance benefits if (1) there is a change in control of the Company and (2) within three months before or 24 months after the change in control, either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason. “Severance benefits” currently consist of:

• | A cash payment equal to three times in the case of Dr. Mehrabian or two times in the other cases the sum of (i) the executive’s highest annual base salary within the year preceding the change in control and (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan bonus target for the year in which the change in control occurs or the average actual bonus payout for the three years immediately preceding the change in control, whichever is higher.


• | A cash payment for the current Annual Incentive Plan bonus cycle based on the fraction of the year worked times the Annual Incentive Plan target objectives at 100%.


• | Payment in cash for unpaid performance share program awards, assuming applicable goals are met, at 120% of performance targets.


• | Continued equivalent health and welfare (e.g., medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability) benefits at our expense for a period of up to 36 months (24 months in some agreements) after termination (with the executive bearing any portion of the cost the executive bore prior to the change in control); provided, however, such benefits would be discontinued to the extent the executive receives similar benefits from a subsequent employer.


• | Removal of restrictions on restricted stock issued under our restricted stock award programs.

11


• | Full vesting under the Company’s pension plans (within legal parameters) such that the executive shall be entitled to receive the full accrued benefit under all such plans in effect as of the date of the change in control, without any actuarial reduction for early payment.


• | Up to $25,000 ($15,000 in some agreements) reimbursement for actual professional outplacement services.


• | Immediate vesting of all stock options, with options being exercisable for the full remainder of the term.


• | There is no “gross up payment” to hold the executive harmless against the impact, if any, of federal excise taxes imposed on executive as a result of “excess parachute” payments as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The executive will receive the better of, on an after-tax basis, (a) the unreduced excess parachute payment with no tax gross up payment, or (b) a parachute payment reduced to a level below which an excise tax is imposed.


• | Certain payments are deferred for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company has entered into individual Indemnification Agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of Teledyne, including those members of Executive Management listed above. The Indemnification Agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a stand-alone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under Delaware law. The Indemnification Agreements also provide:

• | In a third-party proceeding, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, if in a criminal action or proceeding, if the indemnitee had no reason to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. In a third party proceeding, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, judgment fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnity.


• | In proceedings by or in the name of the Company (e.g., derivative suits), an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. In derivative suits, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, but in proceedings where the Company is alleging harm caused by the indemnitee, the indemnitee would generally not be entitled to be indemnified for judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (otherwise the Company would effectively not recover any damages), unless a Delaware or other court determines otherwise despite the finding of liability.


• | The Company has an obligation to advance, on an unsecured and interest free basis, reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within 30 days of the indemnitee’s request. The indemnitee does not need to meet any standard of conduct to be entitled to advancement of expenses and there is no determination requirement to be made by the Board in connection with the advancements of expenses. An indemnity must repay any amounts advanced if it ultimately determined that the indemnity is not entitled to indemnification.

Our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations: (1) where indemnification payments have been made under director’s and officer’s insurance or other indemnification provisions; (2) where the claim is based on disgorgement of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; (3) where the claim is based on reimbursement by the indemnitee to the Company of a bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation if required under the Exchange Act (e.g., in connection with a restatement as a result of the Company’s noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); or (4) where the proceeding is initiated by the indemnitee (other than proceedings that are consented to by the Board or that the indemnitee initiates against the Company to enforce the Agreement).
Under the Indemnification Agreements, in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s and officer’s insurance coverage, we are required to purchase (or cause the acquirer or successor to the Company to purchase or maintain) a six-year tail policy, subject to a 200% premium cap. The agreements continue until the later of (i) 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer, and (ii) one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement.
