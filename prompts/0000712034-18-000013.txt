ITEM 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the terms "ACCO Brands," "ACCO," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ACCO Brands Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2005, and its consolidated domestic and international subsidiaries.
For a description of certain factors that may have had, or may in the future have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
Overview of the Company
ACCO Brands is a designer, marketer and manufacturer of recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools, and homes. Our widely known brands include AT-A-GLANCE®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra® and Wilson Jones®. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select product categories in which we compete. We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail and commercial channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 55% of our sales were outside the U.S.; up from 43% in 2016. This increase was the result of the Esselte and Pelikan Artline acquisitions, which further extended our geographic reach. For further information on the acquisitions see "Note 3. Acquisitions" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report and "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Over the past several years we have transformed our business by: divesting certain non-core commercially-oriented product lines; acquiring companies with consumer and end-user demanded brands, and continuing to diversify our distribution channels. In 2012, we acquired the Mead Consumer and Office Products business ("Mead C&OP"), which substantially increased our presence in North America and Brazil in school and calendar products with well-known consumer brands. In 2016, we purchased the remaining equity interest in Pelikan Artline from our joint venture partner, which enhanced our competitive position in school and business products in Australia and New Zealand and added new consumer categories, including writing instruments and janitorial supplies. In early 2017, we acquired Esselte Group Holdings AB ("Esselte"), which more than doubled our presence in Europe and added several iconic business brands, a significant base of independent dealer customers, and a new product category of do-it-yourself hardware tools. Together these three acquisitions have meaningfully expanded our portfolio of well-known end-user demanded brands, enhanced our competitive position from both a product and channel perspective, and added scale to our business operations.
Today our Company is a global enterprise focused on developing innovative branded consumer products for use in businesses, schools and homes. We believe our leading product category positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive profitable growth. We expect to derive much of our growth, over the long term, in faster-growing emerging geographies such as Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which exhibit stronger demand for our product categories than in developed markets. In all of our markets we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and innovative products. We plan to supplement organic growth globally with strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent product categories.
Reportable Segments
ACCO Brands has three operating business segments each of which is comprised of different geographic regions. Each of the Company's three operating segments designs, markets, sources, manufactures and sells recognized consumer and end-user demanded brands used in businesses, schools and homes. Product designs are tailored based on end-user preferences in each geographic region.

Our product categories include storage and organization; stapling; punching; laminating, binding and shredding machines and related consumable supplies; whiteboards; notebooks; calendars; computer accessories; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. Our portfolio of consumer and end-user demanded brands includes both globally and regionally recognized brands.

Operating Segment | Geographic Regions | Primary Brands 
ACCO Brands North America | United States and Canada | AT-A-GLANCE®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Mead®, Quartet®, and Swingline®
ACCO Brands EMEA | Europe, Middle East and Africa | Derwent®, Esselte®, GBC®, Kensington®, Leitz®, NOBO®, Rapid®, and Rexel® 
ACCO Brands International | Australia, Latin America and Asia-Pacific | Artline®, GBC®, Kensington®, Marbig®, Quartet®, Rexel®, Tilibra®, and Wilson Jones® 


Sales Percentage by Operating Segment | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
ACCO Brands North America | 51 | % | | 65 | % | 68 | %
ACCO Brands EMEA | 28 | % | | 11 | % | 13 | %

 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

ACCO Brands North America
The ACCO Brands North America segment is comprised of the United States and Canada where the Company is a leading branded supplier of consumer and business products under brands such as AT-A-GLANCE®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Mead®, Quartet®, and Swingline®. The ACCO Brands North America segment designs, sources or manufactures and distributes school notebooks, calendars, whiteboards, storage and organization products (such as three-ring binders, sheet protectors and indexes), stapling, punching, laminating, binding and shredding products, and computer accessories, among others, which are primarily used in schools, homes and businesses. The majority of revenue in this segment is related to consumer and home products and is associated with the "back-to-school" season and calendar year-end purchases; we expect sales of consumer products to become an increasingly greater percentage of our revenue as they are faster growing than most business-related products.
ACCO Brands EMEA
The ACCO Brands EMEA segment is comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where the Company is a leading branded supplier of consumer and business products under brands such as Derwent®, Esselte®, GBC®, Kensington®, Leitz®, NOBO®, Rapid®, and Rexel®. The ACCO Brands EMEA segment designs, manufactures or sources and distributes storage and organization products (such as lever-arch binders, sheet protectors and indexes), stapling, punching, laminating, binding and shredding products, do-it-yourself tools, and computer accessories, among others, which are primarily used in businesses, homes and schools.
ACCO Brands International
The ACCO Brands International segment is comprised of Australia, Latin America and Asia-Pacific where the Company is a leading branded supplier of consumer and business products under brands such as Artline®, GBC®, Kensington®, Marbig®, Quartet®, Rexel®, Tilibra®, and Wilson Jones®, among others. The ACCO Brands International segment designs, sources or manufactures and distributes school notebooks, calendars, whiteboards, storage and organization products (such as three-ring binders, sheet protectors and indexes), stapling, punching, laminating, binding and shredding products, writing instruments, and janitorial supplies, among others, which are primarily used in businesses, schools and homes. The majority of revenue in this segment is related to consumer products and is associated with the “back-to-school” season and calendar year-end purchases; we expect sales of consumer products to become an increasingly greater percentage of our revenue as they are faster growing than most business-related products.
Certain financial information for each of our business segments and geographic regions is incorporated by reference to "Note 16. Information on Business Segments" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.

Customers
ACCO Brands markets and sells its strong multi-product offering broadly and is not dependent on any one channel. Our products are sold through all relevant channels, namely retailers, including: mass retailers; e-tailers; discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; and contract stationers. We also sell directly to commercial and consumer end-users through our e-commerce platform and our direct sales organization. Changes in consumer buying patterns over the past several years have resulted in increased consumer purchases of our products through mass retailers and e-tailers. Increased sales through retail and e-tail channels have partially mitigated the impact of lower traffic and sales experienced by the traditional office products suppliers and wholesaler channels.
Our top ten customers accounted for 44% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, no customer exceeded 10% of our net sales. Sales to Staples amounted to approximately 14% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Sales to Walmart amounted to approximately 10% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales to Office Depot amounted to approximately 10% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low-cost competitors, large, sophisticated customers, low barriers to entry, and competition from a wide range of products and services (including private label). ACCO Brands competes with numerous branded consumer products manufacturers as well as numerous private label suppliers and importers, including many of our customers who import their own private label products directly from foreign sources. Examples of branded competitors to ACCO Brands include Bi-Silque, Blue Sky, CCL Industries, Dominion Blueline, Fellowes, Hamelin, Herlitz, LSC Communications, Newell Rubbermaid, Novus, Smead, Spiral Binding and Stanley Black and Decker, among others.
The Company meets its competitive challenges by creating and maintaining leading brands and differentiated and innovative products that deliver superior value, performance and benefits to consumers. Our products are sold to consumers and end-users through diverse distribution channels delivering superior customer services. We further meet consumer needs by developing, producing and procuring products at a competitive cost, which are priced attractively. The Company’s management also believes that its experience at successfully managing a complex, highly seasonal business is a competitive advantage.
Product Development
Our strong commitment to understanding our consumers and designing products that fulfill their needs drives our product development strategy, which we believe is and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Our products are developed from a strong understanding of consumer needs by our own research and development team or through partnership initiatives with inventors and vendors. Costs related to consumer and product research when paid directly by ACCO Brands are included in marketing costs and research and development expenses, respectively. Research and development expenses amounted to $23.5 million, $21.0 million and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 1.2%, 1.3% and 1.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We consistently review our business units and product offerings, assess their strategic fit, and seek opportunities to invest in new products and adjacencies as well as to rationalize our product offerings. The criteria we use in assessing strategic fit or investment opportunities include: the ability to increase sales for the Company; the ability to create strong, differentiated products and brands; the importance of the product category to key customers; the relationship with existing product lines; the importance to the market; the actual and potential impact on our operating performance; and the value to ACCO Brands versus an alternative owner.
Marketing and Demand Generation
We support our brands with a significant investment in targeted marketing, advertising and consumer promotions, which increase brand awareness and highlight the innovation and differentiation of our products. We work with third party vendors, such as Nielsen, NPD Group, GfK SE and Kantar Group, to capture and analyze consumer buying habits and product trends. We also use our deep consumer knowledge to develop effective marketing programs, strategies and merchandising activities.

Raw Materials
The primary materials used in the manufacturing of many of our products are paper, plastics, resin, polyester and polypropylene substrates, steel, wood, aluminum, melamine, zinc and cork. These materials are available from a number of suppliers, and we are not dependent upon any single supplier for any of these materials. Based on our experience, we believe that adequate quantities of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future.
Supply
Our products are either manufactured or sourced to ensure that we supply our customers with quality products, innovative solutions and attractive pricing as well as convenient customer service. We have built a customer-focused business model with a flexible supply chain to ensure that these factors are appropriately balanced. Using a combination of manufacturing and third-party sourcing also enables us to reduce our costs and effectively manage our production assets by lowering capital investment and working capital requirements. Our overall strategy is to manufacture locally those products that would incur a relatively high freight and/or duty expense or that have high customer service needs and source through third-parties those products, which require higher direct labor to produce. We also look for opportunities to leverage our manufacturing facilities to improve operating efficiencies as well as customer service. We currently manufacture approximately half of our products locally where we operate, and source the remaining half in lower cost countries, primarily China, but also other Far Eastern countries and Eastern Europe.
Seasonality
Historically, our business has experienced higher sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year and we expect these trends to continue. Two principal factors contribute to this seasonality: (1) we are a major supplier of products related to the back-to-school season, which occurs principally from June through September for our North American business and from November through February for our Australian and Brazilian businesses; and (2) several product categories we sell lend themselves to calendar year-end purchase timing, including planners, paper organization and storage products (including bindery) and Kensington® computer accessories, which have higher sales in the fourth quarter driven by traditionally strong fourth-quarter sales of personal computers and tablets. As a result, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, most of our earnings in the second half of the year and much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters as receivables are collected.
For further information on the seasonality of net sales and earnings, see "Note 19. Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.
Intellectual Property
Our products are marketed under a variety of trademarks. Some of our more significant trademarks include ACCO®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, and Wilson Jones®. We own rights to these trademarks in various countries throughout the world. We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also own numerous patents worldwide. While we consider our portfolio of trademarks, patents, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations in the aggregate, the loss of any one trademark, patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling, disposal and clean-up of waste materials and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. This includes environmental laws and regulations that affect the design and composition of certain of our products. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, financial condition and results of operations or competitive position.
4

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6,620 full-time and part-time employees. There have been no strikes or material labor disputes at any of our facilities during the past five years. We consider our employee relations to be good.
