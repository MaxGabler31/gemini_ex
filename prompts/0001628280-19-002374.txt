Overview 

Fitbit is a technology company focused on delivering health solutions that impact health outcomes. The Fitbit platform combines wearable devices with software and services to give our users tools to help them reach their health and fitness goals, augmented by general purpose features that add further utility and drive user engagement. Our wearable devices, which include health and fitness trackers and smartwatches, enable our users to view data about their daily activity, exercise and sleep in real-time. Our software and services, which include an online dashboard and mobile app, provide our users with data analytics, motivational and social tools, and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. In addition, our software and services drive engagement and can be leveraged to provide personalized insights. Together, our devices, services, and software have helped millions of users on their health and fitness journeys be more active, sleep better, eat smarter, and manage their weight. Fitbit appeals to a wide spectrum of consumers by addressing key health and fitness needs with advanced technology embedded in simple-to-use products and services. 

The core of our platform is our family of wearable devices. These devices automatically track users’ daily steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and active minutes, and display real-time feedback to encourage users to become more active in their daily lives. Most of our wearable devices also measure floors climbed, and sleep duration and quality, and our more advanced products track heart rate, and GPS-based information such as speed, distance, and exercise routes. Several of our devices also have more advanced features such as the ability to receive call and text notifications, and certain of our devices offer contactless payments, on-board music, notifications, and several apps. To accompany certain of our products, we offer accessories that include wireless headphones, interchangeable wrist bands and frames, colored clips, device charging cables, wireless sync dongles, band clasps, and Fitbit apparel. In addition, we offer a Wi-Fi connected scale that records weight, body fat, and BMI. We are able to enhance the functionality and features of our wearables through wireless updates. 

Our platform also includes software that helps to encourage healthy behavior changes in three areas: activity, sleep, and nutrition. The software includes our online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with our devices. It enables users to see trends and achievements and, access motivational tools such as coaching and guidance, or connections to our community. We believe gamifying behaviors and providing virtual badges, real-time progress notifications, social support, and a competition dashboard helps drive engagement. Our direct connection with our users also enables us to provide personalized insights. In addition, we extend the value of our platform through our open API, which enables third-party developers to create health and fitness apps that interact with our platform. Through our open platform and our large community of users, we have established an ecosystem that includes thousands of third-party health and fitness apps that connect with our products and enhance the Fitbit experience.
Our platform enables a wide range of people to get fit their own way, whatever their interests and goals. Our users range from people interested in improving their health and fitness through everyday activities to endurance athletes seeking to maximize their performance. To address this wide range of needs, we design our devices, apps, and services to be easy to use so that they fit seamlessly into peoples’ daily lives and activities. Our users can sync their Fitbit devices with and view their dashboard on their

computers and over 200 mobile devices, including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone products. This cross-platform capability coupled with broad global distribution have enabled us to attract what we believe is one of the largest community of wearable device users. The size of our user community increases the likelihood that our users will be able to find and engage with like-minded individuals, friends, and family, creating positive network effects that reinforce our growth. In addition, data from our large community enables us to enhance our product features, provide improved insights, and offer more valuable guidance for our users.
The Fitbit Platform

Our wearable platform is designed to enable our users to improve their health and fitness by:


• | Tracking activities through our wearable devices. We empower users to live healthier, more active lifestyles by both tracking the information that matters most to them and providing them with real-time feedback. Our wearable devices span multiple styles, form factors, and price points, and, as a result, address the needs of a wide range of people—from people simply looking to get fit by increasing their activity levels to endurance athletes seeking to maximize their performance. Our devices, which include both health and fitness trackers and smartwatches and our Wi-Fi connected scale, feature proprietary and advanced sensor technologies and algorithms and long battery lives. In addition, the ease of use and small, lightweight, and durable designs of our devices help them fit effortlessly into our users’ lifestyles.


• | Learning through our online dashboard and mobile apps. We offer our users a personalized online dashboard and mobile apps that sync automatically with and display data from our wearable devices. We provide our users with a wide range of information and analytics, such as charts and graphs of their progress and the ability to log caloric intake. Both our online dashboard and mobile apps are free and work with all of our wearable devices. Our internally-developed software is regularly updated and enhanced, increasing the utility of our platform.


• | Staying motivated through social features, notifications, challenges, and virtual badges. Our products help millions of users achieve their goals both individually and within the community that they choose. On an individual level, we motivate users by delivering real-time feedback, including notifications, leaderboard and challenge updates, and virtual badges. Our platform also offers users social features that allow them to view and participate in a social feed, receive and provide support through specific groups organized by activity or health, and engage in friendly competition. Users can securely share some or all of their health and fitness information on an opt-in basis with friends, family, and other parties and compete against each other on key statistics through leaderboards and daily or multi-day fitness challenges. In addition, users can choose to share their data with thousands of third-party apps and through social networks on an opt-in basis. As users create more connections on our network, they often benefit from higher levels of activity.


• | Improving health and fitness through goal-setting, personalized insights, premium services, and virtual coaching. Our primary goal is to help our users improve their health and fitness. We believe our platform assists users in changing their daily behavior, such as going for a run or walking more to reach a goal or win a challenge. We empower our users to set their own health and fitness goals and track their progress towards these goals. We also offer premium services on a subscription basis that provide personalized insights and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive video-based exercise experiences on mobile devices and computers. Our premium services feature in-depth data analysis and personalized reports, as well as benchmarking against peers.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strengths are brand, community, and data. 
Brand

• | Fitbit is a leading global wearables brand. We stand for health and fitness and have a trusted relationship with our users. We have a singular focus on driving positive health outcomes by targeting activity, sleep, and nutrition.


• | Broad and differentiated go-to-market strategy. We have developed a broad go-to-market strategy that reaches individuals regardless of where they shop. We sell our products in over 39,000 retail stores and in 87 countries, through our retailers’ websites, through our online store at Fitbit.com, and through Fitbit Health Solutions. We believe the breadth and depth of our established selling channels and prominent presence in retail stores would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.

Community

• | Broad range of wearable devices. We believe everyone’s approach to fitness is different, so we offer our users a range of wearable devices spanning multiple styles, form factors, and price points to allow people to find the devices that fit their lifestyles and goals. In addition to our wrist-based and clippable wearable health and fitness devices, we also offer a Wi-Fi connected scale that tracks weight, body fat, and BMI. We believe the breadth of our wearable devices provides us with a competitive advantage over our competitors, which often have a more limited line of products.


• | Large and growing community and powerful network effects. We believe the size of our community of users makes it more likely that users can connect with like-minded individuals, friends, and family and attracts many new users to our platform. Achieving meaningful health and fitness outcomes over the long-term is difficult. We believe that access to a network of users who provide support and motivation can increase a user’s engagement with and duration on the platform, especially when that network provides positive support as observed on our social feed. Each of our users adds value to our platform by making progress towards their goals and syncing their data with our platform, which we leverage to provide better insights for our users. As our community of users continues to grow, we will develop a deeper understanding of our users and expect to deliver additional value to them through more detailed insights and analysis. We believe the growth and scale of our user community allows users to become not only more engaged with personalized and relevant content, but also less likely to leave a community in which many of their friends and family are active members. 


• | Direct relationship and continuous communication with our users. The connectivity of our devices allows us to better understand our users’ health and fitness goals. This connectivity also allows us to communicate the most relevant analysis, features, advice, and content to our users throughout the day with our online dashboard, mobile apps, emails, and notifications. It also allows us to focus on developing software that influences the behavior of our users to improve health outcomes, which can not only drive new forms of monetization, but also further engagement and duration of usage. We also utilize these communication channels to help our users become aware of our new products and services. 

Data

• | Advanced, purpose-built hardware and software technologies. Our wearable devices leverage industry-standard technologies, such as Bluetooth low energy, as well as proprietary technologies, such as our PurePulse continuous heart rate tracking and our algorithms that measure and analyze user health and fitness metrics. We devote significant resources to ensure that our devices effortlessly fit into our users’ lifestyles. For example, we design our small, lightweight, durable, and fashionable products to be optimized for power efficiency, which enables automatic wireless data syncing without compromising battery life. We place a similarly strong emphasis on our online dashboard and mobile apps to provide users with visualization of their progress and personalized guidance. Our highly-scalable cloud infrastructure enables millions of users around the world to engage with our platform in real-time.


• | Broad mobile compatibility and open API. Our broad mobile compatibility and open API enable a large health and fitness ecosystem that provides additional value to our existing users and extends our reach to potential new users. Our users can sync their Fitbit devices with and view their online dashboard on their computers and over 200 mobile devices, including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone products. Additionally, we enable seamless integration with thousands of apps across iOS, Android, and Windows Phone through our open API, which allows our users to share data with third-party apps on an opt-in basis.

Our Devices and Accessories

Our line of devices includes Fitbit Charge 3™, Fitbit Surge®, Fitbit Blaze®, Fitbit Charge 2®, Alta HR™, Alta®, Fitbit Ace™, Fitbit Flex 2®, Fitbit One® and Fitbit Zip® activity trackers, as well as Fitbit Ionic™ and Fitbit Versa™ smartwatches, and Fitbit Aria 2™ Wi-Fi Smart Scales. We also offer a line of accessories including bands and frames for some of our devices, as well as Fitbit Flyer™, our wireless headphone designed for fitness.

Our Software and Services 
We believe our software and services offer the ability to engage the user and effect behavior change, representing an opportunity to diversify our revenue stream and deepen our relationship with our users. As we continue to work towards driving and influencing health outcomes, we believe there is an opportunity for our software to play a role in chronic disease management. We offer both enterprise software such as corporate challenges for Fitbit Health Solutions customers and coaching and guidance for our retail customers. Revenue from our software and services has historically represented less than one percent of our annual revenue. 
Fitbit online dashboard and mobile apps. We offer our users a personalized online dashboard and mobile apps that sync automatically with, and display real-time data from, our wearable devices. Through these offerings, we provide users with charts and graphs of their progress, deeper analysis of their activities, and the ability to log caloric intake. Additionally, we motivate users through real-time feedback including notifications, leaderboard and challenge updates, and virtual badges. Our platform also offers users social features, such as access to an online community of users, leaderboards and challenges, that allow users to receive and provide support and engage in friendly competition. Our online dashboard and mobile apps are available for free through the iOS App Store, Google Play, Windows Store, and on Fitbit.com.

Fitbit Coach. In March 2015, we acquired FitStar, a provider of interactive video-based exercise experiences on mobile devices and computers that utilize proprietary algorithms to adjust and customize workouts for individual users based on data gathered during their workouts. We rebranded FitStar to Fitbit Coach beginning in October 2017. Through our Fitbit Coach offering, we provide exercise programs through personal trainer and yoga apps that continuously adjust to our users based on feedback throughout the workout. 
Fitbit Care™. In September 2018, we launched Fitbit Care, a connected health platform for health plans, employers, and health systems that combines health coaching and virtual care through the new Fitbit Plus™ app, Fitbit’s wearable devices and self-tracking and personalized digital interventions to help improve wellness, disease management and prevention. Fitbit Care combines our experience inspiring people to get healthy with the clinically-proven behavior change principles of Twine Health, which Fitbit acquired in March 2018 to improve care team collaboration and health outcomes across the spectrum of care. Fitbit Care is sold through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel.
Our Commitment to Privacy 

We are committed to respecting our users’ privacy, letting our users decide how their information is used and shared, and keeping their data safe.

We have developed our data collection and use practices in accordance with the Fair Information Practice Principles, or FIPPs. We are committed to the following privacy principles as outlined in our privacy policy:

• | Transparent and Easy to Understand Policies. We are transparent about our data practices and explain them in clear language. Our data collection practices are designed to only collect data that is useful to improving our products, services, and user experience.


• | No Unexpected Uses. We never sell personally identifiable data or use it other than as described in our privacy policy.


• | Clear Notice and Consent. We only share personally identifiable data with third parties, including employers, when our users consent to the sharing and under the limited circumstances outlined in our privacy policy where users’ personally identifiable data can be shared without specific consent, such as our receipt of search warrants or subpoenas from law enforcement agencies or in response to a validly issued legal process in a civil litigation matter.


• | Prioritize Security. We take the security of our users’ data seriously. We use a combination of technical and administrative security controls to help ensure the security of user data.

Research and Development

We are passionate about developing innovative products and services that empower our users to reach their health and fitness goals. We believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that expand the versatility and performance of our existing platform, and we plan to continue to invest significant resources to enhance performance, functionality, convenience, and style for our users.

Our global research and development team supports the design and development of our wearable devices, proprietary sensors, firmware, data algorithms, and online dashboard and mobile apps. Our team is also researching new advanced science to help deepen our penetration of wearable devices. The team is comprised of dedicated research employees, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, firmware engineers, site operations engineers, and mobile app developers. Our research and development team is primarily based at our headquarters in San Francisco, California, as well as several other worldwide locations.

Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment 

We outsource the manufacturing of our products to several contract manufacturers. These contract manufacturers produce our products in their facilities, which are primarily located in Asia. The components used in our products are sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers selected by us and our contract manufacturers, and are located worldwide. Our operations employees coordinate our relationships with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility at lower costs than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. We evaluate our current contract manufacturers and component suppliers on an ongoing basis, including whether or not to utilize new or alternative contract manufacturers or component suppliers.

We work with third-party fulfillment partners that deliver our products from multiple locations worldwide, which allows us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs, and improve inventory flexibility.

Sales Channels and Customers 

We sell our products through three primary channels:

Retail and distribution channel. We offer our products in over 39,000 retail stores and in 87 countries. We focus on building close relationships with our retailers, working with them to merchandise our products in a compelling manner both in-store and on their e-commerce sites, promoting our products through their marketing efforts, and educating their sales forces about our products. In addition, we sell to distributors who resell our products to retailers. 

• | Consumer electronics and specialty retailers. Our products are sold by retailers with a large domestic and international presence such as Best Buy.


• | e-Commerce retailers. Our products are sold on Amazon.com, in addition to the e-commerce sites of our retailers.


• | Mass merchant, department store, and club retailers. Our products are sold by large retailers, including Target, Costco, Macy’s, Kohl’s, and Walmart.


• | Sporting goods and outdoors retailers. Our products are sold by sporting goods and outdoors retailers, including Dick’s Sporting Goods and REI.


• | Wireless carriers. Our products are sold by wireless carriers, including Verizon.


• | Distributors. Our products are sold by a network of distributors.

Consumer direct channel. We sell our full line of products directly to consumers in the United States and other countries through our online store at Fitbit.com, which represented 10% of our revenue in both 2018 and 2017. We drive consumers to our website through online and offline advertising as well as marketing promotions. 

Fitbit Health Solutions channel. Fitbit Health Solutions delivers health and wellness solutions designed to increase engagement, improve health outcomes and drive positive returns for employers, health plans, and health systems. It leverages our consumer device technology to build a platform of hardware and software tools to motivate people to make sustained behavior change. We believe our strong brand recognition and success with consumers makes Fitbit a desirable partner for the healthcare and enterprise ecosystem. Fitbit Health Solutions partners and sells offerings to employer health and wellness plans, health plans, hospitals, and researchers through a direct sales team and indirectly through partners. In the fall, we launched Fitbit Care, a connected health platform for health plans, employers, and health systems that combines health coaching and virtual care, wearable devices, and personalized digital interventions to better support patients outside the walls of the clinical environment. 

Backlog

There is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
Marketing and Advertising

Our marketing and advertising programs are focused on building global brand awareness, increasing product adoption, including the launch of new product offerings, and driving sales. Our marketing and advertising efforts target a wide range of 
6

consumers and leverage traditional advertising methods (including television, cinema, and print magazines), sponsorships and public relations, digital marketing, channel marketing, and endorsements by professional athletes and celebrities.

Our in-store merchandising strategy focuses on our point of purchase, or POP displays. We install our freestanding, in-line, and endcap POP displays of varying sizes at our various retailers. These displays communicate our marketing messages, present our products and their features and, in many cases, allow consumers to try on our devices and view an interactive app that enables them to learn more about our products.

Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.

We have developed a significant patent portfolio to protect certain elements of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2018, we had 480 issued patents. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. 
Competition 

The market for wearable devices is both evolving and competitive. The wearable devices category has a multitude of participants including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin and Withings, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, and Samsung. For example, Apple sells the Apple Watch, which is a smartwatch with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and Apple has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.

The principal competitive factors in our market include:


• | brand awareness and focus;


• | breadth of product offerings;


• | battery life, sensor technology, and tracking features;


• | online and mobile app experience;


• | cross-platform capability (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone);


• | software algorithms;


• | partnerships;


• | strength of sales and marketing efforts; and


• | distribution strategy.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of our community of users, leading global brand, and data. The size of our user community increases the likelihood that our users will be able to find and engage with like-minded individuals, friends, and family, creating positive network effects. We believe that our success with consumers, along with our focus on health and fitness, makes us an attractive wearables partner for the healthcare and enterprise ecosystem. Furthermore, our platform and open API have together enabled us to establish a large and growing health and fitness ecosystem that not only provides additional value to our existing users, but also extends our reach to potential new users.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,694 global employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
