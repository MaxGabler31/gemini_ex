Item 1. Business
General
We are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products. Our operations are comprised of four segments: Aerospace & Electronics, Process Flow Technologies, Payment & Merchandising Technologies, and Engineered Materials. Our primary end markets include process industries (chemical production, oil & gas, power, and general industrial), non-residential and municipal construction, payment automation solutions, banknote design and production, aerospace, defense and space, along with a wide range of general industrial and certain consumer related end markets.
We have been committed to the highest standards of business conduct since inception in 1855 when our founder, R.T. Crane, resolved “to conduct my business in the strictest honesty and fairness; to avoid all deception and trickery; to deal fairly with both customers and competitors; to be liberal and just toward employees; and to put my whole mind upon the business.”
Our strategy is to grow earnings and cash flow by focusing on the manufacturing of highly engineered industrial products for specific markets where our scale is a relative advantage, and where we can compete based on our proprietary and differentiated technology, our deep vertical expertise, and our responsiveness to unique and diverse customer needs. We continuously evaluate our portfolio, pursue acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and selectively divest businesses where appropriate. We strive to foster a performance-based culture focused on productivity and continuous improvement, to attract and retain a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of our shareholders, and to maintain a focused, efficient corporate structure.
We operate a comprehensive set of business processes, philosophies and operational excellence tools to drive continuous improvement throughout our businesses (collectively, the Crane Business System). Beginning with a core value of integrity, we incorporate “Voice of the Customer” teachings (specific processes designed to capture our customers’ requirements) and a broad range of tools into a disciplined strategy deployment process to continuously improve safety, quality, delivery, cost and growth.  An embedded intellectual capital development process helps ensure that we attract, develop, promote and retain talent to drive continuity and repeatable results.
Recent Transactions
On May 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the Engineered Materials segment to Grupo Verzatec S.A. de C.V. for $360 million on a cash-free and debt-free basis. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We determined that the Engineered Materials segment met the criteria of being reported as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2021. As a result, the related assets, liabilities and operating results of Engineered Materials are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity are presented on a continuing operations basis. See Part II, Item 8 under Note 3, “Discontinued Operations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

Process Flow Technologies
In the second quarter of 2021, we changed the name of our 'Fluid Handling' segment to 'Process Flow Technologies'. This new name better conveys the key strengths and core competencies of the segment; providing proprietary and highly engineered process flow technology solutions to its customers. The Process Flow Technologies segment is a provider of highly engineered fluid handling equipment for mission critical applications that require high reliability. The segment is comprised of Process Valves and Related Products, Commercial Valves, and Pumps and Systems.
Process Valves and Related Products manufactures on/off isolation valves, instrumentation and controls, and related products for critical and demanding applications primarily in the chemical and petrochemical, general industrial, energy- related and pharmaceutical end markets globally. Products are sold under the trade names Crane, Saunders, Jenkins, Pacific, Xomox, Krombach, DEPA, ELRO, REVO, Flowseal, Centerline, Resistoflex, Duochek, Barksdale, Dynalco, Westlock, WTA, HOKE and DOPAK.

Engineered Materials sells the majority of its products directly to RV, trailer, and truck manufacturers, and it uses distributors and retailers to serve the commercial and industrial construction markets. Manufacturing facilities are located in the United States. In the second quarter of 2021, the Engineered Materials segment met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. See “Recent Transactions” for additional details.
Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole
Competitive Conditions
Our businesses participate in markets that are highly competitive. Because of the diversity of products manufactured and sold, our businesses typically have a different set of competitors in each geographic area and end market in which they participate. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the number of competitors, or precise market share; however, we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our markets. Our primary basis of competition is providing high quality products, with technological differentiation, at competitive prices, with superior customer service and timely delivery.
Our products are sold into primary end markets which include process industries (chemical production, oil & gas, power, and general industrial), non-residential and municipal construction, payment automation solutions, banknote design and production, aerospace, defense and space, along with a wide range of general industrial and certain consumer related end markets. As such, our revenues depend on numerous unpredictable factors, including changes in market demand, general economic conditions, customer capital spending, timing and amount of contract awards and credit availability. Since our products are sold in such a wide variety of markets, we do not believe that we can reliably quantify or predict the potential effects of changes in any of the aforementioned factors.
Our engineering and product development activities are focused on improving existing products, customizing existing products for particular customer requirements, as well as the development of new products. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property, no one of which is of such importance that termination would materially affect our business. From time to time, however, we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property.
Raw Materials
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics, cotton, flax and various petroleum-based products. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. Although market forces have at times, including in 2021, caused increases in the costs of key raw materials, there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business. We believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at acceptable costs. For a further discussion of risks related to raw materials, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Seasonal Nature of Business
In aggregate, our business does not experience significant seasonality.
Government Contracts
We have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in our Aerospace & Electronics and Payment & Merchandising Technologies segments and, to a lesser extent, our Process Flow Technologies segment. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts. For example, some government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Environmental Compliance and Climate Change
We are regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce significant volumes or quantities of byproducts that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment if not properly handled or maintained. Accordingly, continued compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures or earnings. 
However, we occasionally engage in environmental remediation activities as required by federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in the characterization and remediation of federal Superfund sites, or analogous state sites. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. For 
further discussion of environmental related risks, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” For further discussion of our environmental matters, please refer to Part II, Item 8 under Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Human Capital Resources
To remain a leading manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products, it is important that we continue to attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent across our global enterprise. 
The Company has a diverse global workforce located in 34 countries, spanning six continents. At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 11,000 persons worldwide, of which substantially all were full time employees. In the United States, we employed approximately 5,800 people across 94 locations. At December 31, 2021, approximately 4% of our U.S. employees were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. Employees based in some foreign countries may, from time to time, be represented by works councils or unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our associates. We are committed to developing our associates personally and professionally by leveraging a structured and disciplined Intellectual Capital (“IC”) process. This regular IC cadence includes constructive reviews and various talent and leadership development initiatives conducted by the executive management team and provided throughout an associate’s career. We are also committed to an inclusive and high-performance culture at all levels of the organization, based on trust and respect.
The manufacture and production of our products requires the use of a variety of tools, equipment, materials, and supplies. At Crane, we are strongly committed to the health and safety of our associates and strive to continuously adhere to global regulatory safety requirements and to reduce the incidence and severity of job-related injuries. We utilize strict compliance protocols, training programs, effective risk management practices, and sound science in our operations to minimize risk to our associates. 
Beginning in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented flexible remote work options and health and safety protocols and procedures across all of our global offices, manufacturing and distribution facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates. These protocols included proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use and temperature screenings and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S., and other similar public health authorities in our international locations. 
For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
