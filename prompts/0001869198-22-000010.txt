Who We Are
Life Time, the “Healthy Way of Life Company,” is a leading lifestyle brand offering premium health, fitness and wellness experiences to a community of nearly 1.3 million individual members, who together comprise more than 724,000 memberships, as of December 31, 2021. Since our founding nearly 30 years ago, we have sought to continuously innovate ways for our members to lead healthy and happy lives by offering them the best places, programs and performers. We deliver high-quality experiences through our omni-channel physical and digital ecosystem that includes more than 150 centers—distinctive, resort-like athletic destinations—across 29 states in the United States and one province in Canada. Our track record of providing differentiated experiences to our members has fueled our strong, long-term financial performance. In 2021, a year in which we saw an initial recovery from the impacts of COVID-19, we generated $1,318 million of revenue, a net loss of $579 million and $80 million in Adjusted EBITDA. In 2020, which was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we generated $948 million of revenue, a net loss of $360 million and $(63) million in Adjusted EBITDA. In 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generated $1,900 million of revenue, net income of $30 million and $438 million in Adjusted EBITDA.
Our luxurious athletic centers, which are located in both affluent suburban and urban locations, total more than 15 million square feet in the aggregate. We offer expansive fitness floors with top-of-the-line equipment, spacious locker rooms, group fitness studios, indoor and outdoor pools and bistros, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, basketball courts, LifeSpa, LifeCafe and our childcare and Kids Academy learning spaces. Our premium service offering is delivered by approximately 30,000 Life Time team members, including over 7,800 certified fitness professionals, ranging from personal trainers to studio performers. Our members are highly engaged and draw inspiration from the experiences and community we have created, as demonstrated by the 69 million visits to our centers in 2021, 48 million visits to our centers in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic and 92 million visits to our centers in 2019.

Our footprint of premium athletic centers as of December 31, 2021:
We believe that no other company in the United States delivers the same quality and breadth of health, fitness and wellness experiences as we deliver, which has enabled us to consistently grow our recurring membership dues and in-center revenues for 20 consecutive years, prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our recurring membership dues represented 68%, 67% and 63%, respectively, of our total revenue, while our in-center revenue, consisting of Life Time Training, LifeCafe, LifeSpa, Life Time Swim and Life Time Kids, among other services, represented 29%, 29% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenue. Between 2015 and 2019, we grew our average revenue per center membership from $1,883 to $2,172, a testament to the significant value that our members place on engaging with Life Time. While average revenue per center membership fell to $1,317 in 2020, we experienced a strong rebound in 2021, with $2,098 in average revenue per center membership. 
Our Growth Strategies and Member Experience Initiatives
We have built a strong foundation with an engaged membership base in pursuit of a healthy way of living. We are executing on several strategies to grow our business and drive our memberships and revenue per center membership, including expanding the number of our premium centers in an asset-light model that targets higher income members, higher average annual revenue per center membership and higher returns on invested capital. We are also implementing new strategies to elevate our member experiences, including introducing new types of memberships, providing concierge-type member services, expanding our omni-channel offerings and improving our in-center services. We believe these strategies will allow us to reach our pre-COVID-19 center revenue more quickly than the recovery of our total center memberships.
Continue to Grow Our Membership Base
We believe we will continue to expand our membership base as consumer activity returns post-pandemic and by continuing to increase our member experiences and brand awareness, acquire new consumers and retain our current members longer. We expect to grow our consumer reach through the following initiatives:
•Data-driven, targeted marketing campaigns focused on personalized experiences. Employ targeted marketing campaigns driven by data analytics to increase personalized experiences, brand awareness and membership growth, as well as engage in consumer-focused marketing related to improving consumers’ health post-pandemic.
•Expand and elevate service offerings. Continue to expand and elevate our service offerings to attract and retain members of all ages, from extended childcare hours for kids, to new studio classes, to pickleball for the aging population. We believe extending and elevating our existing membership offerings with complementary or fee-based services and benefits will continue to drive broader appeal, higher memberships and longer member retention.

•Market share gains. Capture orphaned members from fitness centers that shut down during the pandemic. According to International Health, Racquet, and Sportsclub (“IHRSA”), from March 2020 when the pandemic began to December 31, 2021, approximately 25% of health clubs and fitness facilities and 30% of studios closed permanently. We believe we are well-positioned to capture a portion of these consumers within our markets.
We believe that employing these strategies will enable us to continue to grow our membership base over the long-term.
Increase Revenue per Center Membership
We expect to increase revenue from our members by executing on the following initiatives:
•Expand and elevate in-center offerings that generate incremental revenue. We nearly doubled our average in-center revenue per membership from 2007 to 2019. Although we saw a decline in average center revenue per membership during 2020, we experienced a recovery during 2021. We intend to continue to expand and elevate our health, fitness and wellness offerings to cater to all types of interests and levels, and to drive increased spend by members within our centers.
•Enhance membership pricing. We expect to increase spend from consumers by developing new premium centers in more affluent markets that drive higher membership dues, enhancing experiences at our existing centers to create more value and pricing opportunities and, over time, transitioning existing memberships to higher membership prices or tiers as we continue to add more value to their memberships.
Expanded National Footprint and Strategic Focus on Locations in Affluent Metropolitan Statistical Areas
We believe we have significant whitespace opportunity for our premium athletic centers across the United States and Canada, as well as internationally. Over the last five-plus years, we have expanded our footprint on the East and West coasts, and increased our presence in premium, urban and coastal areas such as Boston, Chicago, New York City and California. Our new center expansion initiatives are focused on strategic locations that will generate higher average dues, higher in-center revenue per membership and higher revenue per square foot. Our geographic and upscale expansion has been enabled by our flexible center formats, which can be modified to accommodate traditional suburban, vertical residential, urban and mall/retail locations.
Between 2016 and 2019, we opened eight new centers per year on average. After opening three new centers in 2020, we opened six new centers in 2021 and have a pipeline to open 22 or more new centers in 2022 and 2023. As we continue to focus on premium athletic centers in affluent areas, we closed four small under-performing centers in 2021, each of which was subject to a lease that we decided to let expire rather than renew. Our new centers historically have ramped to maturity over three to four years with a high level of consistency. As our annual number of new centers increases, we believe this ramping club dynamic will provide further support and predictability to our overall revenue and earnings growth.
We also intend to complement our organic growth through acquisitions. We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, athletic centers as well as services and experiences. Our acquisitions can be single assets or portfolios of assets. We take a disciplined approach to sourcing, acquiring and integrating high quality assets and/or locations and complementary businesses that can help us continue to expand into new geographic areas, acquire key talent and offer new services and experiences. Our post-acquisition integration process often involves significant investments in both the acquired physical assets and human capital to improve each acquired site and to rebrand the look and feel of the center to create the Life Time brand experience for our members.
Asset-light, Flexible Real Estate Strategy
Approximately 58% of our centers are now leased, including approximately 94% of our new centers opened within the last five years, versus a predominantly owned real estate strategy prior to 2015. Our focus on a flexible real estate strategy has enabled us to develop a business model that targets a new center return on invested capital of mid-to-upper thirties percent, more than double historical trends, grow the number of centers at a faster pace and enter attractive urban coastal markets with premium centers where the price of real estate had historically been a deterrent to entry. 
Expanded Memberships and Omni-Channel Membership Offerings
We believe the importance of health, fitness and wellness coupled with the structural shift of consumer preferences toward experiential and proactive health and wellness spending creates new opportunities for us to leverage our “Healthy Way of Life” lifestyle brand. As our business model evolves and our membership base grows, we expect to leverage our brand reputation and use our deep understanding of membership needs to add a growing portfolio of products and services to our omni-channel 
Table of Contents
platform. We also believe that we can leverage our brand reputation to expand our operations internationally. While our operations are predominantly in the United States today, we continuously analyze our growth strategy and believe we have opportunities to expand our digital and physical ecosystem and healthy way of life internationally.
We continue to evolve our premium lifestyle brand in ways that elevate our members’ experiences and allow our members to more easily and regularly integrate health, fitness and wellness into their lives. We are introducing new memberships and communities, including our signature membership that includes unlimited small group training and priority registrations, and our new ARORA community focused on members aged 55 years and older. We are also focused on delivering a concierge experience to our members. As we enhance our member experiences and services, and further differentiate Life Time, we are able to adjust the pricing for our memberships and services accordingly.
We are also enhancing our digital platform to deliver a true omni-channel experience for our members. Our Life Time Digital offering delivers live streaming fitness classes, remote goal-based personal training, nutrition and weight loss support and curated award-winning health, fitness and wellness content. Through an agreement with Apple®, we also provide Apple Fitness+ to our members, which gives our members expanded content and wellness data monitoring on the go. In addition, our members are able to purchase a wide variety of equipment, wearables, apparel, beauty products and nutritional supplements via our digital health store. We are continuing to invest in our digital capabilities in order to strengthen our relationships with our members and more comprehensively address their health, fitness and wellness needs so that they can remain engaged and connected with Life Time at any time or place. 
We are also expanding our “Healthy Way of Life” ecosystem in response to our members’ desire to more holistically integrate health and wellness into every aspect of their daily lives. In 2018, we launched Life Time Work, an asset-light branded co-working model, which offers premium work spaces in close proximity to our centers and integrates ergonomic furnishings and promotes a healthy working environment. We have eight Life Time Work locations open and operating, with plans to open more in the following years. Life Time Work members also receive access to all of our resort-like athletic destinations across the United States and Canada. Additionally, we opened our first Life Time Living location in 2021, another asset-light extension of our “Healthy Way of Life” ecosystem, which offers luxury wellness-oriented residences. While we are in the early stages of capitalizing on this opportunity, we believe integrating how and where consumers live, work, move and play is a promising opportunity that Life Time is uniquely positioned to capture. As we expand our footprint with new centers and nearby work and living spaces, as well as strengthen our digital capabilities, we expect to continue to grow our omni-channel platform to support the “Healthy Way of Life” journey of our members wherever they are.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths power our brand and business model:
Authentic, Premium “Healthy Way of Life” Brand
We have built Life Time into a premier health, fitness and wellness lifestyle brand, earning the trust of our members for nearly 30 years to make their lives healthier and happier. We believe that consumers equate our brand with the uncompromising quality, luxury and “Healthy Way of Life” experiences that Life Time offers. We have built this credibility and robust brand equity through our continuous focus on high quality member experiences delivered through what we believe to be the best programs with the best performers in the best places. We believe our brand loyalty will allow us to continue to grow our core business as well as expand our omni-channel platform in digital, work, living and other health, fitness and wellness experiences.
Differentiated and Uncompromising Omni-Channel Experiences
Our omni-channel platform offers members an exceptional breadth of physical and digital experiences that meet or exceed our members’ expectations:
•Full Suite of Comprehensive Offerings: Life Time offers an expansive array of amenities, services and activities, thereby enabling members to enjoy a “Healthy Way of Life” across a diverse and varied set of offerings. Whether taking advantage of our state-of-the-art fitness equipment, partaking in summer camp for kids, competing in one of our sports leagues or relaxing in one of our award-winning spas, Life Time members enjoy a full end-to-end experience that can be utilized by the entire family and enable them to grow and develop, regardless of where they are in their health and wellness journey.
Table of Contents
•World-Class Talent: We recruit, hire and certify those whom we believe are the best certified fitness professionals and performers in the industry to empower, educate and entertain our members. In addition, to enhance our member experiences and drive consistency in our hospitality and services, we have a strong focus on team member culture, training and certification. Life Time University, our in-house, proprietary education and certification division, offers curricula curated by over 20 dedicated professionals providing team members with online and in-person training and certification.
•Passionate Culture: Our focus on engagement among team members and performers attracts and fosters our multi-generational member base. We deeply value diversity, equity and inclusion at Life Time and strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture. In addition, we foster community engagement through a wide range of events and activities, from parent-child dances to pool parties to charity runs. Since the start of 2019, we have organized approximately 15,000 events and served as a social and community hub for our members.
•Digital Offerings: Life Time Digital enables our members to experience some of our best offerings at their fingertips at any time and wherever they are located in the United States or Canada.
Loyal and Engaged Multi-Generational Membership Base with Attractive Demographics
Life Time’s breadth of premium services and offerings attracts anyone who wants to lead a healthier, happier life. The power of our lifestyle brand, attractive member demographics, breadth of amenities and services and high utilization of our centers allow us to build deeply meaningful connections with our members, which are difficult for others in our industry to replicate fully. From young children attending our swim lessons and Kids Academy classes, or teenagers engaged in our sports and agility training, to members of all ages participating in our iconic athletic events and variety of in-center activities, we have something for every generation. As of December 31, 2021, 75% of our members owned a home and had a median household income of $119,000 and approximately 59% of our members are part of a couples or family membership, and these members typically engage more fully within our centers. Approximately 62% of our members had at least a college education. Additionally, our gender mix is balanced and approximately 48% of our members are below 35 years of age and approximately 81% are under 55 years of age. On average, revenue per center membership was $1,317 and $2,172 at our centers during 2020 and 2019, respectively, and average visits per membership ranged from 69 and 108 times during the same periods, respectively. We experienced an improvement in these metrics during 2021, with average revenue per center membership of $2,098 at our centers and average visits of 113 times per membership.
Flexible Real Estate Strategy with Nationwide Footprint
We have a diversified portfolio of over 150 resort-like athletic destinations that are primarily located in affluent markets across 29 states and one Canadian province. Over the last five years, we have transitioned to an asset-light strategy through sale-leaseback transactions and have adopted more strategic and flexible center formats that can be modified to accommodate various settings, including traditional suburban, vertical residential, urban and mall/retail locations. Our focus on a flexible real estate strategy since 2015 has enabled us to develop a business model that targets a new center return on invested capital of mid-to-upper thirties percent, more than double historical trends, grow the number of centers at a faster pace and enter attractive urban and coastal markets with premium centers where the price of real estate had historically been a deterrent to entry. We also benefit from our in-house architecture, design and construction expertise that allows us to create sustainable and energy efficient centers. These efforts have helped us control the cost and pace of capital expenditures and have also ensured a consistent feel across our centers.
We have developed a disciplined and sophisticated process to evaluate markets and specific sites in those markets where we may want to build new centers. This dynamic process is based upon demographic, psychographic and competitive criteria generated from profiles of our most successful centers, and we continue to refine these criteria based upon the performance of our centers. We believe that the presence of a Life Time center benefits landlords and the value of the underlying property and surrounding neighborhoods. We seek to leverage this halo effect of our brand, as well as long-term relationships with landlords, to achieve favorable lease agreements and increased construction reimbursements from landlords to support our capital light expansion.
Recurring Revenue Model with Consistent Growth
Membership dues from our network of members create a recurring and relatively predictable revenue stream that has proven to be resilient for nearly 30 years and across economic cycles. Membership dues provide our largest source of revenue, representing 68%, 67% and 63% of our total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Table of Contents
We have grown from $137 million, $4 million and $36 million in revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, in 2001 to $1,900 million, $30 million and $438 million in revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, in 2019. During that time period, we did not have a year-over-year decline in revenue or Adjusted EBITDA. While revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA did decline to $948 million, $(360) million and $(63) million, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we saw a recovery during 2021 as we re-opened our centers and began to emerge from the pandemic. During 2021, we generated $1,318 million, $579 million and $80 million in revenue, net loss and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
Passionate, Visionary, Founder-Led Management Team with Deep Industry Experience
Our unwavering commitment to excellence and a “Healthy Way of Life” culture is driven by our passionate management team, under the leadership of Bahram Akradi, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Life Time was founded by Mr. Akradi in 1992 with a goal of helping people achieve their health, fitness and wellness goals by delivering entertaining, educational and innovative experiences with uncompromising quality and unparalleled service. From the very beginning, Mr. Akradi has led the Company with a focus on serving members’ needs first and a belief that business results would naturally follow.
By building a strong and highly experienced executive leadership team, Life Time has continued to grow and consistently deliver exceptional experiences. Our executive leadership includes:
•Tom Bergmann, President & Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Bergmann has been with Life Time for more than six years and has more than 30 years of leadership experience across various industries, including as Chief Financial Officer at three companies including USF Corporation (prior to being acquired by Yellow Corporation), Amsted Industries and Harley Davidson.
•Jeff Zwiefel, President & Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Zwiefel has been with Life Time for over 20 years and has more than 35 years of experience in the health, fitness and wellness industry.
•Eric Buss, Executive Vice President & Chief Administrative Officer. Mr. Buss has been with Life Time for over 20 years and has served as a key executive leader in a variety of roles.
•Parham Javaheri, Executive Vice President & Chief Property Development Officer. Mr. Javaheri joined Life Time in 2004 and has over 20 years of experience in real estate development.
•RJ Singh, Executive Vice President & Chief Digital Officer. Mr. Singh joined Life Time in 2017 and oversees all digital and technology infrastructure, operations and initiatives.
Our team has an entrepreneurial spirit that we believe makes us highly adaptable, reflects an ownership mentality and allows us to navigate shifts in the health, fitness and wellness landscape, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the strength of our team, culture and organizational approach position us to continue to grow and deliver strong financial results.
Strong Financial Performance
Our compelling financial profile is distinguished by our long-term track record of consistent revenue growth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, growth of new centers in attractive markets, a high percentage of predictable recurring membership revenue, increasing revenue per center membership and strong profitability.
•Long-Term Track Record of Revenue Growth. We believe the strength of our brand and the effective execution of our operating strategy have driven our long-term track record of growth. Prior to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, we grew our revenue each year from 2000 through 2019.

Revenue ($ in millions)
•Highly Successful New Center Openings. Our asset-light, flexible real estate strategy and compelling center economics have enabled us to successfully open new centers in attractive markets. From 2016 through December 31, 2021, we opened 40 new centers, increasing our total center count by 36.0%.
•Predictable Recurring Membership Revenue. Due to our strong membership base, our membership dues represent a predictable recurring revenue stream that provides stability to our business. Center memberships were approximately 649,000 at the end of 2021 compared to approximately 501,000 at the end of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, Center memberships were approximately 854,000 at the end of 2019. With respect to the net increase of approximately 148,000 Center memberships during 2021, the percentage of that net increase attributable to members converting from Digital On-hold was approximately 66%, or 98,000 memberships. The proportion of our total revenue generated by the resulting recurring membership dues was 68%, 67% and 63% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•Increasing Average Revenue Per Center Membership. Between 2015 and 2019, we grew our average revenue per center membership from $1,883 in 2015 to $2,172 in 2019, a testament to the significant value that our members place on engaging with Life Time. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, average revenue per center membership fell to $1,317 in 2020 and recovered to $2,098 in 2021. As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic with a smaller membership balance, one of our strategies is to continue to increase our average revenue per center membership.
•Strong Profitability. We have maintained a highly profitable business model, achieving a 1.6% net income margin and 23.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2019. These metrics were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, falling to a (38.0)% net loss margin and (6.6)% Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2020 and a (44.0)% net loss margin and 6.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Financial Performance
On March 16, 2020, we closed all of our centers based on orders and advisories from federal, state and local governmental authorities responding to the spread or threat of spread of COVID-19. While our centers were closed, we did not collect monthly access membership dues or recurring product charges from our members. We re-opened our first center on May 8, 2020 and continued to re-open our centers in accordance with evolving state and local governmental guidance. As of December 31, 2021, all of our 151 centers were open.
After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized the health and safety of our members and team members by developing and implementing robust COVID-19 operating protocols, while taking appropriate steps to ensure our financial stability, including by reducing operating expenses, delaying capital investments and securing additional debt financing. We continue to refine these protocols and may take further actions as governmental authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the interests of our members, team members, vendors and service providers as we operate in the evolving COVID-19 environment, including as a result of variants such as the Delta and Omicron variants. Despite the challenges presented by the governmental response to the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to the health, fitness and wellness industry, we have remained committed to our mission and our members and began our recovery in 2021.
Number of Centers. While our new center construction and growth was slowed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully opened nine new centers since the end of 2019 through December 31, 2021, seven of which opened after the onset of the pandemic. We have also continued our real estate development efforts after initially suspending them during the pandemic, and had 12 centers under construction as of December 31, 2021. We opened six new centers in 2021 and closed four small under-performing centers with expiring leases, and we have a pipeline to open 22 or more new centers in 2022 and 2023.

Revenue and Net Income (Loss). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our total revenue fell from $1,900 million for 2019 to $948 million for 2020. This revenue loss resulted in a reduction of net income from approximately $30 million in 2019 to net losses of approximately $360 million in 2020. Our results began to recover in 2021 and we generated $1,318 million in total revenue but experienced net losses of approximately $579 million, which included tax-effected expenses of $269.1 million related to non-cash share-based compensation expense and $68.6 million of additional interest expense incurred as a result of a loss on the conversion of a related-party secured note into preferred stock, as well as costs incurred in connection with our debt refinancing and partial pay down of our Term Loan Facility.
Memberships. We define memberships for our centers as Center memberships and Digital On-hold memberships (as further detailed below under “—Our Membership Offering”). Both Center memberships and Digital On-hold memberships include Life Time Digital. Center memberships grew from approximately 814,000 at the end of 2018 to approximately 854,000 at the end of 2019. By the end of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Center memberships had declined to approximately 501,000 as we experienced more conversions of Center memberships to Digital On-hold memberships as well as a higher level of membership terminations. However, we saw significant improvement in our Center membership numbers during 2021 and had approximately 649,000 Center memberships as of December 31, 2021 due in large part to the conversion of Digital On-hold memberships back to Center memberships. 
Our Membership Offering
We define a membership for our centers in two ways: Center memberships and Digital On-hold memberships. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 724,140 total memberships, comprised of 649,373 Center memberships and 74,767 Digital On-hold memberships. We also have Digital memberships that we began to offer in December 2020 for direct-to-consumer memberships that do not provide access to our centers.
Center Memberships. We offer a variety of convenient month-to-month memberships with no long-term contracts. Each Center membership is defined as one or more adults 14 years of age or older, plus any juniors under 14.
•Base Memberships. We offer base memberships that provide one or more individuals 14 years of age or older general access (with some amenities excluded) to a selected home center and all centers with the same or a lower base monthly dues rate. Our optimized pricing for a Center membership is determined center-by-center based on a variety of factors, including geography, market presence, demographic nature, population density, initial investment in the center and available services and amenities. Base memberships typically include locker and towel service, group fitness classes and access to the Life Time app.
•Junior Memberships. We offer junior memberships (as an add-on to a base membership) that provide one or more children 13 years of age or younger access to the child center, pools and gymnasiums at designated times, drop-off events and Kids Academy, which includes more in-depth programming focused on activity, learning and fitness. Junior memberships currently cost $10 to $90 per month depending upon the center. We do not count junior memberships as incremental in our membership count since they are already part of the Center membership.
•Other Memberships and Products. We offer several other recurring memberships and access-related products at select centers, including a Signature Membership that bundles a base membership with small group training, a Tennis Membership that bundles a base membership with tennis and a Pool Pass that provides access to the outdoor pool area at select centers.
Digital On-hold Memberships. We offer Digital On-hold memberships for members who do not currently wish to access our centers, but still want to maintain certain member benefits, including our Life Time Digital membership, and the right to convert to back to a Center membership without paying an enrollment fee. The majority of our Digital On-hold memberships cost $15 per month, which we may not charge from time to time, including during periods of the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to maintain member engagement. 
Digital Memberships. We launched Life Time Digital direct-to-consumer in December 2020 to bring our “Healthy Way of Life” programs, services and content to consumers virtually. Life Time Digital features include live streaming fitness classes, remote goal-based personal training, nutrition and weight loss support, curated award-winning health, fitness and wellness content and access to Apple Fitness+. Currently, our digital membership is included with both our Center and Digital On-hold memberships at no additional charge or it can be purchased separately as a digital-only membership. We currently report our Digital memberships within our Digital On-hold membership totals.

Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 30,000 Life Time team members, including 21,000 part-time employees and over 7,800 certified fitness professionals, ranging from personal trainers to studio performers. On average, our centers are generally staffed with approximately 140 to 200 full-time and part-time employees depending on center activity levels.
Since our founding, we have believed that creating and sustaining a trusted community, where members know their experiences will always be exceptional, requires the highest levels of passion and commitment from our entire team. Our team members are dedicated to providing the best programs and experiences, in the best facilities, by the best people and performers. By consistently delivering extraordinary experiences, we have built a highly trusted, premium lifestyle brand that embraces all aspects of healthy living, healthy aging and healthy entertainment. Collectively, it is what we call “Healthy Way of Life,” or “HWOL.” This is a unique lens through which we can examine every aspect of our lives. It is a healthy perspective on physical, mental and social wellbeing.
To build our HWOL brand that is loved and trusted by members, we have dedicated ourselves to identifying, training and empowering team members who trust our Company like their own families. This was achieved naturally and intuitively at the start and, as our Company has grown, we have intentionally and systematically made it the foundation of what we call our “Culture of Care.” Creating and fostering this culture involves numerous critical details and initiatives – from casting, onboarding, training, certification and career path planning, to establishing supporting programs, such as our Life Time Foundation, Life Time University and Life Time Inclusion Council.
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity at Life Time
At Life Time, we are committed to inspiring healthy, happy lives for everyone in our communities. We embrace our responsibility to create healthy environments and workspaces that honor and champion all through inclusion, equity and diversity. We recognize, empower and celebrate the unique talents, backgrounds and perspectives of individuals so everyone feels welcomed, respected, supported and valued. We believe inclusion is at the heart of our team members’ and members’ sense of belonging. Our focus on making Life Time a “Place for Everyone” is a hallmark of our organization.
Delivering a “Place for Everyone” at Life Time is driven by our strategic pillars of developing an inclusive leader culture, introducing and growing mentoring and coaching for all, reaching out to our community to expand and support healthy communities, and monitoring our team member, member and community diversity. Our senior leadership, as well as our inclusion council and center-level ambassadors, play a critical role in delivering on our value of being a “Place for Everyone.” We also provide programs and development opportunities for all of our team members to grow and sustain the value of inclusion.
Development and Training
We recruit, hire and certify those whom we believe are the best certified fitness professionals and performers in the industry to empower, educate and entertain our members. All center team members are required to participate in a training and certification program that is specifically designed to promote a friendly and inviting environment with each member interaction, while upholding a consistent standard of performance across all of our centers. We provide comprehensive training through our Life Time Education platform that is comprised of both an externally licensed school branded as Life Time Academy (“LTA”) and an internal team member education and certification division that we call Life Time University (“LTU”). LTA offers a certification for entry-level professionals to prepare for a career with Life Time or within the health, fitness and wellness industry. LTU delivers world-class certification, learning, education and development opportunities for all team members. Life Time Education supports the culture of Life Time through enterprise-wide programs in service, inclusion and diversity and personal and professional growth. Team members also receive ongoing mentoring and continuing education, and we require an annual re-certification before any team member is permitted to work or to advance to other positions within our Company.
Our personal trainers, registered dietitians, massage therapists and cosmetologists are required to maintain a professional license or one of their industry’s top certifications.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe that supporting our team members and providing them the tools to be successful in their roles fosters our Culture of Care and enables them to provide extraordinary experiences to our members. We offer a wide range of benefits designed to holistically support our team members in all areas of their lives. In addition to paid time off, paid sick leave, adoption assistance, subsidized medical, dental and vision insurance, company paid life insurance, short and long-term disability, as well as a center membership, we also provide:

•Life Time Mind (“LT Mind”) - LT Mind is a holistic performance coaching program proprietary to Life Time aimed at helping team members optimize their performance, achieve their goals and enhance their well-being. Offerings for all team members include online training and virtual mental resiliency coaching.
We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement with any of our employees. Our continued efforts on building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment centered around our Culture of Care for our team members has created a positive environment where our performers can thrive while delivering an uncompromising member experience, and we believe relations with our employees are good.
Information Systems
In addition to our standard operating and administrative systems, we use an integrated and proprietary member management system to manage the flow of member information within and between each of our centers and our corporate office. We have designed and developed our proprietary system to allow us to easily collect and process information. Our system enables us to, among other things, enroll new members with an electronic membership agreement, capture digital pictures of members for identification purposes and capture and maintain specific member information, including usage. The system allows us to streamline the collection of membership dues electronically, thereby offering additional convenience for our members while at the same time reducing our corporate overhead and accounts receivable. In addition, we use a customer relationship management system to enhance our marketing campaigns and management oversight regarding daily sales and marketing activities.
Competition
We consider the following groups to be the primary participants in the health, fitness and wellness industry:
•health center operators, including, but not limited to, Equinox Holdings, Inc., The Bay Club Company, ClubCorp, LA Fitness International, LLC and 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide, Inc.;
•the YMCA and similar non-profit organizations or community centers;
•physical fitness and recreational facilities established by local governments, hospitals and businesses;
•local salons, cafes and businesses offering similar ancillary services;
•small fitness clubs and studios and other boutique fitness offerings, including Anytime Fitness, Snap Fitness, Planet Fitness, Orange Theory, Barre3, Crunch Fitness and others;
•racquet, tennis and other athletic centers;
•rental unit and condominium amenity centers;
•country clubs;
•digital fitness and health services, including online personal training and fitness coaching;
•the home-use fitness equipment industry;
•athletic event operators and related suppliers; and
•providers of wellness and other health and wellness-orientated products and services.
The health, fitness and wellness industry is highly competitive. While competition in the industry varies from market to market, it may be impacted by various factors, including the breadth and price of membership offerings and other products and services, the flexibility of membership options, the overall quality of the offering, name or brand recognition and economies of scale. We believe that our brand, our comprehensive product offering and focus on services, amenities and value provide us with a distinct competitive advantage, positioning us well to compete in the health, fitness and wellness industry.

Intellectual Property
Our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brand. We file a substantial number of our trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including for Life Time and many of our branded studio classes and service offerings. We consider our brand to be one of our most important assets and certain of our trademarks and service marks to be of material importance to our business and actively defend and enforce such trademarks and service marks. Examples include LIFE TIME®, EXPERIENCE LIFE®, LIFECAFE®, LIFESPA®, LIFE TIME HEALTHY WAY OF LIFE®, LIFE TIME WORK® and LIFE TIME LIVING®. Solely for convenience, our trademarks, service marks or tradenames may appear in this Annual Report without the corresponding ® or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate in any way that we will not assert, to the fullest extent, our rights to such trademarks, service marks and tradenames.
Governmental Laws and Regulations
Our operations and business practices are subject to laws and regulations at federal, state, provincial and local levels, including consumer protection laws related to our advertising, marketing and sales efforts, health and safety regulations and licensing requirements related to our training, cafe, spa, aquatics, child care and ancillary health and fitness-related products and services, environmental laws and regulations, including those related to the handling, use, remediation and storage of hazardous materials, the emission, release and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, and the health and safety of our employees, fair housing laws, accessibility laws, regulations related to the collection, use and security of personal information about our members, guests and purchasers, and wage and hour and other labor and employment laws. In addition, from time to time we have been required to investigate and remediate contamination at some of our sites under such environmental laws and regulations.
In particular, within the health, fitness and wellness industry, state statutes regulate the sale and terms of our membership contracts. State statutes often require that we:
•include certain terms in our membership contracts, including the right to cancel a membership, in most cases, within three to 10 days after joining, and receive a refund of enrollment fees paid;
•escrow funds received from pre-opening sales or post a bond or proof of financial responsibility; and
•adhere to price or financing limitations.
Seasonality of Business
Seasonal trends have an effect on our overall business. Generally, we have experienced greater membership growth at the beginning of the year. We also typically experience increased levels of membership in certain centers during the summer pool season. During the summer months, we also experience a slight increase in our in-center business activity with summer programming and operating expenses due to our outdoor aquatics operations and kids programming. We typically experience an increased level of membership attrition during the third and fourth quarters as the summer pool season ends and we enter the holiday season. This can lead to a sequential decline in memberships during those quarters.
Life Time Foundation
We believe in giving back to our communities in ways that empower people to live happy, healthy lives. In 2003, we formed the Life Time Foundation with a focus on inspiring healthier families. In 2010, we further focused on helping children reach their full potential by improving the nutrition, health, taste and overall quality of the meals served at schools which, for many children, is their sole source of food throughout the day. Specifically, the Life Time Foundation partners with schools to eliminate foods containing highly processed and artificial ingredients in favor of wholesome, real food alternatives and scratch cooking. As of December 31, 2021, the Life Time Foundation has benefited more than 35 school districts, including the largest school district in the United States (New York City), impacting over 3,600 schools with more than 265 million meals served to over 1.7 million students annually.
