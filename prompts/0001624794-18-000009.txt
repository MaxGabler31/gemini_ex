ITEM 1: BUSINESS
General
CSWI is a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across two business segments: Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals. Our broad portfolio of leading products provides performance optimizing solutions to our customers. Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) and refrigeration applications, sealants and high-performance specialty lubricants. Markets that we serve include HVAC, industrial, rail, plumbing, architecturally-specified building products, energy, mining and other general industrial markets. Our manufacturing operations are concentrated in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, but we also have distribution operations in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and our products are sold directly or through designated channels in over 100 countries around the world, including: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S.
Drawing on our innovative and proven technologies, we seek to deliver solutions to our professional customers that require superior performance and reliability. We believe that our industrial brands, such as RectorSeal No. 5® and KOPR-KOTE®, are well known in the specific industries we serve and have a reputation for high quality and reliability. Through organic growth and acquisitions, we believe that we are well positioned to offer our customers an increasingly broad portfolio of performance optimizing solutions. We have a successful record of making accretive acquisitions, and we believe that there are further attractive acquisition opportunities available within the markets in which we operate.
We have a long history of providing high quality specialty chemicals, sealants and other products, accompanied by dependable service and attention to customer satisfaction. For example, our specialty lubricants were used on the excavation equipment for the Panama Canal in the late 1800s. We also have a long history of innovation. We believe that we were the first to develop a method for removing internal acid from air conditioning and refrigeration systems, pioneering the market for acid neutralizers. We partner with our customers to solve specific challenges, such as environment-friendly lubricants, which were specifically developed to provide high performance in rail applications combined with biodegradability and no eco-toxicity and to satisfy strict environmental requirements.
CSWI is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2014 in anticipation of CSWI's separation from Capital Southwest Corporation ("Capital Southwest"), which occurred on September 30, 2015. Since the separation, CSWI has been an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The separation was executed on September 30, 2015 through a pro-rata share distribution of all the then outstanding shares of common stock of CSWI to the holders of common stock of Capital Southwest (the "Share Distribution"). 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Broad Portfolio of Industry Leading Products and Solutions
We have a broad portfolio of products with leading industry positions in the specific end markets in which we operate. We believe our products and solutions are differentiated from those of our competitors by superior performance, quality and total value delivered to customers. For example, our RectorSeal No. 5® product is widely regarded as an industry standard for thread sealants for HVAC, plumbing and electrical configurations. Additionally, we believe our KOPR-KOTE® product is recognized as the anti-seize compound of choice for use in oil and gas drilling operations, where it is requested by name.
Sustainable Organic Revenue Growth and Operating Performance
We focus on end markets with strong growth trends. We also have a loyal customer base that recognizes the performance and quality of our products and solutions, including continuously evaluating the potential uses of existing products to broaden our market penetration. Further, our customer base is diverse: for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, no single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues.
These factors have enabled us to generate strong margin performance. We are focused on improving our profitability through targeted investments to further optimize our manufacturing processes. For example, in both of our reportable segments, we have taken actions to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in order to optimize capacity, improve efficiency and leverage technologies while enhancing product quality. Further, we continually look to refine our manufacturing processes in all of our manufacturing facilities to lower manufacturing costs, increase production capacity and improve product quality.

Stable Platform for Acquisitions with Proven Track Record
We believe that our experience in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions is one of our core competitive strengths, as evidenced by over 30 acquisitions that we have successfully completed since 1991. Since April 1, 2012, our acquisitions have either (1) added new products designed to service our existing end markets, or (2) provided an entry into new, complementary end markets where we can drive revenue growth and improved profitability. Historically, our acquisitions have been relatively small, lower-risk acquisitions of a product that we have identified as having the potential to benefit from our extensive distribution network and manufacturing efficiencies. 
We did not complete any acquisitions during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and completed one acquisition during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Effective February 28, 2017, we acquired Greco Aluminum Railings, a leading manufacturer of high-quality engineered railing and safety systems for multi-family and commercial structures. Effective October 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Deacon Industries, Inc., a leading manufacturer of high temperature sealants and injectable packings. Effective December 16, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of AC Leak Freeze, a leading manufacturer of original equipment manufacturer-safe air conditioning and refrigerant leak repair solutions. 
Culture of Product Enhancement and Customer Centric Solutions
We have a long history of serving our customers with high quality products and solutions. We work closely with our customers, industry experts and research partners to continuously improve our existing products to meet evolving customer and market requirements. Our highly trained and specialized personnel work directly with our current and prospective customers to enhance our product offerings by expanding the use and markets for our existing products. We focus on product enhancements and product line extensions that are designed to meet the specific application needs of our customers. We believe this focus has helped us build strong industrial brands and develop a reputation for high quality, in turn leading us to realize improved customer retention and loyalty. Further, our ability to meet the needs of high-value niche end markets with customized solutions that leverage our existing products has enabled us to differentiate ourselves from our larger competitors that may not have the flexibility or interest in responding quickly to evolving customer demands in these smaller, niche markets.
Diverse Sales and Distribution Channels
Many of our products are sold through service-intensive distribution networks committed to technical support and customer satisfaction. We primarily market through an international network of independent manufacturer representatives and agents calling on our wholesale distributors, contractors and direct customers. The strong, long-term relationships we have developed with our wholesale distribution partners allow us to introduce new products, including both newly developed and acquired products. In addition, our extensive distribution network allows us to reach and serve niche end markets that provide organic growth opportunities and form a key component of our acquisition strategy.
Our Growth Strategy
We are focused on creating significant stockholder value over the long term by increasing our revenue, profitability and free cash flow through: (1) expanding the markets and uses for our existing products; and, (2) growing the portfolio of products we manufacture, market and sell through organic growth initiatives and targeted acquisitions. We believe the key drivers of our growth include:
Leveraging Existing Customer Relationships and Products and Solutions
We expect to drive revenue growth by leveraging our reputation for providing high quality products to our long-standing customer base. Our team of sales representatives, engineers and other technical personnel continues to proactively collaborate with our distributors and end users to enhance and adapt existing products and solutions to meet evolving customer needs. In addition, we seek to leverage our existing customer base to cross-sell our products and solutions across our two business segments, thereby driving organic growth.
Product Innovation to Accelerate Organic Growth
2

 The collaborative relationships and open feedback channels we have with our distributors and end users allow us to add value not only through enhancing and adapting existing products and solutions, but also through efficiently developing new products and solutions to meet existing and future customer needs. Our research and development, sales and marketing personnel work together to identify product opportunities and methodically pursue development of innovative new products. Through developing new products and solutions to both address new markets and complement our product portfolio in markets we currently serve, we create increased opportunities to drive organic growth.
Focused Acquisitions that Leverage our Distribution Channels
While we are focused on new product development, improving our existing products and penetrating new markets with these products, we expect to continue to identify and execute acquisitions that will broaden our portfolio of products and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We primarily focus on commercially proven products and solutions that would benefit from a broader distribution network and are attractive to our customers in target end markets. Once acquired, our intent is to utilize our extensive distribution networks to increase revenue by selling those products to our diversified customer base.
Benefits Resulting from the Share Distribution
Historically, our operating companies functioned as independent companies with discrete strategies and capital structures. The Share Distribution has allowed us, as an independent, standalone company, to pursue a strategy focused on rationalizing our organizational structure and management around our two business segments. We expect this strategy to enable us to realize cost and operational synergies, implement best practices across our operations, cross-sell product offerings and, as a result, grow our market share and increase our profitability.
Additionally, we believe our integrated structure allows us to more effectively allocate capital across our two business segments, enabling more efficient financing of operations and planned growth.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our products are manufactured using various raw materials, including base oils, copper flake, aluminum, polyvinyl chloride and tetra-hydrofuran. These raw materials are available from numerous sources, and we do not anticipate significant shortages of such materials in the future. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information. In aggregate, we own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are not materially encumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our existing patents generally expire 10 to 20 years from the dates they were filed, which has occurred at various times in the past. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Export Regulations
We are subject to export control regulations in countries from which we export products and services. These controls may apply by virtue of the country in which the products are located or by virtue of the origin of the content contained in the products. If the controls of a particular country apply, the level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. Where controls apply, the export of our products generally requires an export license or authorization (either on a per-product or per transaction basis) or that the transaction qualify for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for financial and other information regarding our operations on a geographical basis.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters. Management believes that our business is operated in material compliance with all such regulations. To date, the cost of such compliance has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position or that of our operating subsidiaries. Despite the existence of policies, practices and procedures to prevent and mitigate risks, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as 
3

well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
As of March 31, 2018, we employed 730 individuals within our continuing operations. Of these employees, 18 are represented by unions. We believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory, including those employees represented by unions. No unionized facility accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

New Product Development – Customer experience is a core competency in our Industrial Products segment. We gather "voice of the customer" market research through organized focus groups and online surveys, as well as through less formal channels. Ideas for new products or enhancements to existing products are also generated by our relationships with end users, independent sales representatives, distributors and our internal sales and marketing team. We also actively monitor the competitive landscape using a variety of methods. We develop new products and modify existing products in our research and development (“R&D”) labs in Houston, Texas; Rockwall, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Wichita, Kansas; and Windsor, Canada.
Competition – Our competition in the Industrial Products segment is varied. Competitors range from small entrepreneurial companies with a single product, to large multinational original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In the specialty mechanical products category, we compete with Diversitech, Supco, Little Giant, Mitsubishi, Cherne, Mainline and JR Smith. Most of our 
5

products are sold through distribution channels, and we compete based on breadth of product line, customer service and pricing. In the fire and smoke protection category we compete with Won Door, Stoebich, McKeon and others, typically on the basis of product innovation, knowledge of building codes and customer service. In the architecturally-specified building products category, we compete primarily with Emseal, Inpro, and MM Systems on the basis of product innovation, price and driving architectural specifications. In the lubricant storage, filtration and transfer space, we compete with Des-Case, Hy-Pro, IFH and others on the basis of superior performance, brand strength and breadth of product line.
Customers – Our primary customers for specialty mechanical products are HVAC, plumbing and electrical wholesalers and distributors. Some of these are local single location distributors, but many are regional or national in scope with hundreds of locations. The majority of these products are sold domestically; however, a small portion is sold internationally through similar channels, and a small number of OEMs purchase these products directly. Fire and smoke protection products are sold through local building products distributors who also perform installations and service. Architecturally-specified building products are sold primarily through a network of distributors. Storage, filtration and application products are marketed and sold worldwide through a service-intensive distribution network.
Seasonality – A significant portion of our products are sold into the HVAC market, which is seasonal by nature. While products are sold throughout the year, sales tend to peak during summer months.
Specialty Chemicals
Our Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures and supplies highly specialized consumables that impart or enhance properties such as lubricity, anti-seize qualities, friction, sealing properties and heat control. In addition, the segment includes penetrants, pipe thread sealants, firestopping sealants and caulks and adhesives/solvent cements, which are primarily manufactured internally. These materials are typically used in harsh operating conditions, including extreme heat and pressure and chemical exposure, where commodity products would fail. These products protect and extend the working life of large capital equipment such as cranes, rail systems, mining equipment, oil rigs and rotating and grinding equipment found in various industrial segments such as steel mills, canning and bottling, mining and cement. Additionally, our Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures and supplies specialty products used in the HVAC, building and refrigeration market. These products enhance, repair or condition the internal working systems of both industrial and residential systems and are critical to ensuring safe, efficient and effective long-term operational integrity. The Specialty Chemicals segment also supplies products and services into the water well treatment space, which includes testing services and diagnosis of current conditions, coupled with consumable solutions to resolve any problems that have been defined. Our key product types and brand names are included below:

Product Types | Brand Names 
• railroad track lubricants, conditioners and positive friction consumables | • AC Leak Freeze® 
• oil field anti-seize products for drilling and conveyance piping | • Bio Fireshield™ 
• open gear specialty lubricants for heavy equipment | • BioRail® 
• specialty lubricants for various industrial applications | • Deacon® 
• water well treatment products and services | • Decathlon™

 | • Sterilene™ 
 | • Surtac® 
 | • T Plus 2® 
 | • TOR Armor® 
 | • Tru-Blu™ 
 | • Unicid™ 
 | • Well-Guard® 
 | • Whitcam® 

New Product Development – We develop relationships with end-users and channel partners to understand existing and new operating conditions where technical innovation or enhancement is needed. For example, these relationships have generated innovation in the areas of modifying existing lubrication products to operate in arctic conditions or modifying an existing product for use in an application where salt water may be present. The development teams located in Rockwall, Texas and Houston, Texas are also actively defining new end markets for product use and penetration.
Competition – In general, our products are specialty products, rather than commodity, competitors tend to be varied and include global, regional and local companies that may be large or small. The product sales cycle is often long when compared to many commodity consumables, resulting in verifiable and repeatable product performance being the key driver of choice, rather than price. As these products protect and enhance the operation of large capital equipment, qualification is based on the proof of value in application, resulting in a high changeover risk barrier. Typical competitors include Shell, Castrol, Fuchs and Exxon-Mobil. Competitors of our sealants and adhesives products include Dow Corning Corporation, Henkel, 3M Company, Specified Technologies Inc. and Hilti. We compete primarily on the basis of product differentiation, superior performance, quality and customer-centric service.
Customers – Specialty Chemicals products are primarily sold through value-added distribution partners, as well as maintenance and repair operations or catalog channels. Specialty Chemicals provides both market-specific and product line-specific training to both the distribution partners and potential end users. Our specialists often visit end users with our distribution partners to advise on critical application issues, which enhances our ability to both “pull” demand from the end-user and “push” demand to the distributor partner. Specialty Chemicals customers include petrochemical facilities, industrial manufacturers, construction, utilities, plant maintenance customers, building contractors and repair service companies.
Discontinued Operations and Segment Realignment
During the third quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we committed to a plan to divest our Strathmore Products business (the "Coatings business"). This determination resulted in the reclassification of the assets comprising that business to 
7

assets held-for-sale, and a corresponding adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations to reflect discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
Additionally, as a result of our determination to divest the Coatings business, we have realigned our reportable segments to better align our resources to support our ongoing business strategy. We retained our Industrial Products Segment and combined the remaining non-coatings business lines of our historical Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives Segment into the Specialty Chemicals Segment. The reportable segment realignment is consistent with the manner in which we evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions, subsequent to the decision to divest the Coatings business. Historical segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of this change. Our segment information is more fully disclosed in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Historical information also reflects discontinued operations presentation for the portion of our business meeting the held-for-sale criteria as described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
