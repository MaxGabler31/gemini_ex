Item 1. Business.
Company Overview



We are a financial technology company that enables consumers utilizing our e-commerce marketplace to shop for brand name electronics, home furnishings and other durable goods on a lease-to-own (LTO) basis. We effect these transactions by first approving consumers through our proprietary, risk analytics-powered underwriting model. After receiving a signed consumer lease, we then fund the leased item by purchasing the item from our merchant partner and leasing it to our customer. We then collect payments from consumers under the consumer lease. We hold several registered patents and patent applications on aspects of our LTO system. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated approximately $118 million in net lease revenues and fees and realized approximately $3 million in net income.



We believe that our LTO programs, which are designed to improve the quality of life of our customers by providing them the ability to obtain ownership of high-quality durable products under an affordable payment arrangement, support broad untapped expansion opportunities for us within the U.S. consumer retail and e-commerce marketplaces. Central to our business model is our LTO Engine, the proprietary technology that we developed and use to automate the online process for consumers to receive payment terms and spending limits and to enter into leases for durable goods, all within minutes. The LTO Engine allows us to operate through three strategic sales channels: (i) selling directly to consumers via our online FlexShopper.com LTO Marketplace featuring thousands of durable goods, (ii) utilizing our LTO payment method at check-out on our merchant partners’ e-commerce sites and (iii) facilitating LTO transactions with retailers in their physical locations both through their in-store terminals and FlexShopper applications accessed via the Internet. In 2021, we began a test to market an unsecured, consumer loan product for our bank partner that would augment our LTO solution in retailer sales channels. In 2022, based upon the success of this testing, we expect the marketing of our bank partner’s loans to become a strategic solution that we offer to many of our current customers and through our retailer partners.



Our Market Opportunity



The LTO industry offers consumers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining electronics, computers, home furnishings, appliances and other durable goods. FlexShopper’s customers typically do not have sufficient cash or credit to obtain these goods, so they find the short-term nature and affordable payments of LTO attractive.
The Lease-Purchase Transaction



A lease-purchase transaction is a flexible alternative for consumers to obtain brand name merchandise with no long-term obligation. Key features of our lease-purchase transactions include:



Brand name merchandise. FlexShopper offers well-known brands such as LG, Samsung, Sony and Vizio home electronics; Frigidaire, General Electric, LG, Samsung and Whirlpool appliances; Acer, Apple, Asus, Samsung and Toshiba computers and/or tablets; Samsung and Apple smartphones; and Ashley, Powell and Standard furniture, among other brands.



Convenient payment options. Our customers make payments on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Payments are automatically deducted from the customer’s authorized checking account or debit card. Additionally, customers may make additional payments or exercise early payment options, which enable them to save money.



No long-term commitment. A customer may terminate a lease-purchase agreement at any time with no long-term obligation by becoming current on amounts due under the lease-purchase agreement and returning the leased item to FlexShopper.



Applying has no impact on credit or FICO score. We do not use FICO scores to determine customers’ spending limits, so our underwriting does not impact consumers’ credit with the three main credit bureaus.



Flexible options to obtain ownership. Ownership of the merchandise generally transfers to the customer if the customer makes all payments during the lease term, which is 52 weeks, or exercises early payment options.










Key Trends Driving the Industry



Non-prime consumers represent the largest segment of the credit market. According to Experian research published on June 7, 2021, 30% of Americans are categorized as sub-prime consumers. This segment of consumers represents a significant and underserved market.






We also believe current additional industry trends include:




● | Consumers recognizing that they have more convenient options to acquire the products they want. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The difficult retail climate leading retailers to embrace “save the sale” financing to increase sales with new consumers. 
● | Technology advances in online underwriting and LTO digital functionality continuing to drive the B2B market segment by making it easier for retailers and consumers to transact on an LTO basis in an efficient and timely manner. 

Our Growth and Expansion Strategy



Like many industries, the internet and other technology is transforming the LTO industry. FlexShopper has positioned itself to take advantage of this transformation by focusing on the expansion of the LTO industry online and into mainstream retail and e-tail. Through its strategic sales channels, FlexShopper believes it can expand the LTO industry, also known as the rent-to-own or RTO industry. FlexShopper has developed and is currently processing LTO transactions using its “LTO Engine,” FlexShopper’s proprietary technology that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods all within minutes. The LTO Engine is the basis for FlexShopper’s primary sales channels, which include B2C and B2B channels, illustrated in the diagram below:






We believe we have created a unique platform in which our B2B and B2C sales channels beneficially advance each other. For our B2C channels, we directly market to our consumers LTO opportunities at FlexShopper.com, where they can choose from more than 150,000 of the latest products shipped directly to them by some of the nation’s largest retailers. This generates sales for our retail partners, which encourages them to incorporate our B2B solutions into their online and in-store sales channels. The lease originations by our retail partners using our B2B channels, which have low customer acquisition cost to us, subsidize our B2C customer acquisition costs. Meanwhile, our B2C marketing promotes FlexShopper.com, which provides incremental sales for our retail partners, as well as benefitting our FlexShopper.com business.



To achieve our goal of being the preeminent “pure play” virtual LTO leader, we intend to execute the following strategies:



Continue to grow FlexShopper into a dominant LTO brand. Given strong consumer demand and organic growth potential for our LTO solutions, we believe that significant opportunities exist to expand our presence within current markets via existing marketing channels. As non-prime consumers become increasingly familiar and comfortable with our retail kiosk partnerships, online marketplace and mobile solutions, we plan to capture the new business generated as they migrate away from less convenient legacy brick-and-mortar LTO stores.



Expand the range of customers served. We continue to evaluate new product and market opportunities that fit into our overall strategic objective of delivering next-generation retail, online and mobile LTO terms that span the non-prime/near-prime credit spectrum. For example, we are evaluating products with lower fees that would be more focused on the needs of more creditworthy subprime consumers that prefer a less expensive LTO option. In addition, we are continually focused on improving our analytics to effectively underwrite and serve consumers within those segments of the non-prime credit spectrum that we do not currently reach, including profitable deeper penetration of the sub-prime spectrum. We believe the current generation of our underwriting model is performing well and will continue to improve over time as its data set expands.










Pursue additional strategic retail partnerships. We intend to continue targeting regional and national retailers to expand our B2B sales channels. As illustrated in the diagram above, we believe we have the best omnichannel solution for retailers to “save the sale” with LTO options. In retail, the phrase “save the sale” means offering consumers other finance options when they do not qualify for traditional credit. We expect these partnerships to provide us with access to a broad range of potential new customers, with low customer acquisition costs.



Expand our relationships with existing customers and retail partners. Customer acquisition costs represent one of the most significant expenses for us due to our high percentage of online customers. In comparison, no acquisition cost is incurred for customers acquired through our retail partnerships. We will seek to expand our strong relationships with existing customers by providing qualified customers with increased spending limits or offering other products and services to them, as well as seek to grow our retail partnerships to reduce our overall acquisition cost.



Continue to optimize marketing across all channels. Since we began marketing our services to consumers in 2014, we have made significant progress in targeting our customers and lowering our customer acquisition costs. Our efforts have been across different media including direct response television and digital channels such as social media, email and search engines.



Competition and our Competitive Strengths



The LTO industry is highly competitive. Our operation competes with other national, regional and local LTO businesses, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Some of these companies have, or may develop, systems that enable consumers to obtain through online facilities spending limits and payment terms and to enter into leases, in a manner similar to that provided by FlexShopper’s proprietary technology. We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us:



Underwriting and Risk Management



Specialized technology and proprietary risk analytics optimized for the online non-prime credit market. We have made substantial investments in our underwriting technology and analytics platforms to support rapid scaling, innovation and regulatory compliance. Our team of data scientists and risk analysts uses our risk infrastructure to build and test strategies across the entire underwriting process, using alternative credit data, device authentication, identity verification and many more data elements. We believe our real-time proprietary technology and risk analytics platform is better than those of our competitors in underwriting online consumers and consumer electronics. Most of our peers focus on in-store consumers that acquire furniture and appliances, which we believe are easier to underwrite based on our own experience. Additionally, all of our applications are processed instantly with approvals and spending limits provided within seconds of submission.



LTO Products for Consumers and Retailers



Expansive online LTO marketplace. We have made substantial investments in our custom e-commerce platform to provide consumers the greatest selection of popular brands delivered by many of the nation’s largest retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Overstock and Serta and many more. Our platform is custom-built for online LTO transactions, which include underwriting our consumers, serving them LTO leases, syncing and communicating with our retail partners to fulfill orders and all front- and back-end customer relationship management functions, including collections and billing. The result is a comprehensive technology platform that manages all facets of our business and enables us to scale with hundreds of thousands of visitors and products.



Omnichannel “save the sale” product for retailers. In retail, the phrase “save the sale” means offering consumers other finance options when they do not qualify for traditional credit. We believe that we have the best omnichannel solution for retailers to “save the sale” with LTO options. We believe no competitor has a LTO marketplace that provides retailers incremental sales with no acquisition cost. Additionally, compared to our peers, our product for consumers requires no money down and typically fewer application fields. We believe this leads to more in-store and online sales.



Providing LTO consumers an “endless aisle” of products for lease-to-own. As illustrated by our B2C channels in the diagram above, we offer consumers three ways to acquire products on an LTO basis. At FlexShopper.com, our customers can choose from more than 150,000 of the latest products shipped by certain of the nation’s largest retailers. If customers want products that are not available on our marketplace, they may use our “personal shopper” service and simply complete a form with a link to the webpage of the desired durable good. We will then facilitate their purchase by providing an LTO arrangement. We also offer consumers the ability to acquire durable goods with our FlexShopper Wallet smartphone application available on Apple and Android devices. With FlexShopper Wallet, consumers may apply for a spending limit and take a picture of a qualifying item in any major retail store and we will fill the order for them. With our B2C channels, we believe we are providing LTO consumers with a superior LTO experience and fulfilling our mission to help improve their quality of life by shopping for what they want and where they want.










Lean and Scalable Model



Compared to the brick-and-mortar LTO industry, which is suffering from the same challenges as traditional retail stores including declining sales, we have been successful in addressing the LTO consumer through online channels as illustrated in the diagram above of our B2C and B2B sales channels.



We believe our model is more efficient and scalable for the following reasons:



We have no inventory risk and are completely drop-ship. We do not have any of the costs associated with buying, storing and shipping inventory. Instead, our suppliers ship goods directly to consumers.



We serve LTO consumers across the United States without brick-and-mortar stores. We do not have any of the costs associated with physical stores or the personnel needed to operate them.



We achieve more operating leverage as our sales grow. Our model is primarily driven by a technology platform that does not require significant increases in operating overhead to support sales growth.



Sales and Marketing



B2C Channels



We use a multi-channel, analytics-powered approach to marketing our products and services, with both broad-reach and highly targeted channels, including television, digital, telemarketing and marketing affiliates. The goal of our marketing is to promote our brand and primarily to directly acquire new customers at a targeted acquisition cost. Our marketing strategies include the following:



Direct response television advertising. We use television advertising supported by our internal analytics and media buys from a key agency to drive and optimize website traffic and lease originations.



Digital acquisition. Our online marketing efforts include pay-per-click, keyword advertising, search engine optimization, marketing affiliate partnerships, social media programs and mobile advertising integrated with our operating systems and technology from vendors that allow us to optimize customer acquisition tactics within the daily operations cycle.



User experience and conversion. We measure and monitor website visitor usage metrics and regularly test website design strategies to improve customer experience and conversion rates.



B2B Channels



We use internal business development personnel and outside consultants that focus on engaging retailers and e-tailers to use our services. This includes promoting FlexShopper at key trade shows and conferences.
Information Systems



We use computer-based management information systems to facilitate our entire business model, including underwriting, processing transactions through our sales channels, managing collections and monitoring leased inventory. In addition, we have a customer service and call center to facilitate inbound and outbound calls. Through the use of our proprietary software developed in-house, each of our retail partners uses our online merchant portal that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods allwithin minutes. The management information system generates reports that enable us to meet our financial reporting requirements.
Government Regulations



The LTO industry is regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, many of which are in place for consumer protection. In general, such laws regulate, among other items, applications for leases, late fees, finance rates, disclosure statements, the substance and sequence of required disclosures, the content of advertising materials and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws and regulations may result in penalties ranging from nominal amounts up to and including forfeiture of fees and other amounts due on leases. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations and earnings.



Our business is subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers.



Currently, nearly every state and the District of Columbia specifically regulate LTO transactions. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the LTO industry, although federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. Most of the states that regulate LTO transactions have enacted disclosure laws that require LTO companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, the total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. In addition, certain restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the “cost-of-rental” amount that LTO companies may charge on LTO transactions, generally defining “cost-of-rental” as lease fees paid in excess of the “retail” price of the goods. There has been increased legislative attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on consumer debt transactions in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the LTO industry.



See “Risk Factors” below for more information with respect to governmental laws and regulations and their effect on our business.



Intellectual Property



FlexShopper has been granted U.S. Patent Nos. 10,089,682, 10,282,778 and 10,891,687 (see page 13 for additional disclosures) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) since 2018. These patents are for a range of systems, including one that enables e-commerce servers to complete LTO transactions through their e-commerce websites and one that enables retailer devices to complete LTO transactions through their retailer web pages, as well as systems that further enable consumer devices to modify received retailer web pages to indicate LTO payments in association with transaction-eligible products as part of LTO transactions through the retailer web pages. FlexShopper may file additional patent applications in the future. We can provide no assurance that FlexShopper will be granted any additional patents by the USPTO. We believe certain proprietary information, including our underwriting model, and our patented and patent-pending systems are central to our business model and we believe they give us a key competitive advantage. We also rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and work product agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors” below for more information on and risks associated with respect to our intellectual property.
Human Capital



In order to innovate, compete and succeed in our highly competitive market, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain experienced employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer competitive compensation and benefits program. In addition to their base salary, we also offer employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off and retirement benefits. We also provide free emotional well-being services as part of our employee assistance program.



As of December 31, 2021, we had 137 full-time employees, including 80 individuals in our corporate office and 57 individuals in operations center. As of that date, none of our employees were governed by collective bargaining agreements or were members of a union. We foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. We consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
