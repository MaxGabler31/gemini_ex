The Company continued to introduce its products directly to industrial customers during Fiscal 2019. Management believes there is a need for its products and technology in the industrial markets.
 
Except as stated above, there were no other significant contracts or developments with regard to the Company's business during the past fiscal year.
 
Financial Information About Industry Segments. The Company’s revenues were generated from sales of medical and laboratory products in the medical and laboratory industry segment during the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018. For a description of these products, see “Narrative Description of Business.”
See "Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales". See also "Selected Financial Data" and "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
 
Narrative Description of Business. The Company is presently engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, and marketing disposable thermometric and thermographic temperature indicators and accessories for the medical, laboratory and industrial markets. The Company has also developed a bacteria growth retardant agent which is not currently produced or sold by the Company. Further information about the business and proposed products of the Company are described below.
Thermographic and Thermometric Devices and Other Products. During the fiscal year ending April 30, 2019 the Company manufactured and marketed various medical, laboratory, and consumer thermometric, thermographic, and temperature control devices and accessories. These products (described below) were sold to hospitals, clinical end-users, laboratories, and product dealers.

1. | The HemoTempR Core Correlated Blood Monitoring Device ("BMD") is designed to be a human blood bag temperature indicator. Human blood must be maintained, optimally, at 1-3o C., and not allowed to exceed 6-10oC. Since human blood is always in short supply, it is critical that blood be maintained within these specifications to avoid loss. HemoTempR BMD monitors the core temperature of a blood bag from 1-12o C, and replaces the impractical mercury thermometer susceptible to breakage. HemoTempR BMD once attached to the blood bag is usable throughout the life of the blood.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | HemoTempR II Core Correlated BMD is designed to warn blood bank personnel whenever the internal temperature of the blood bag has exceeded approximately 6-10o C. HemoTempR II BMD has an irreversible indicator that is activated when the tag is applied to the blood bag at approximately 3o C. After being activated, the irreversible indicator remains blue colored for at least 48 hours if the blood is kept at 3o C, however, if the blood is warmed to a temperature of 6-10o C. or above, the indicator will lose its blue color much more rapidly or the indicator will change color; the nature and degree of the color change depend on the temperature of the sample and the time at each temperature. The irreversible indicator will not return to blue even if the blood is subsequently recooled, indicating that the blood has been warmed. The reversible portion of the indicator reversibly monitors temperatures from 1-9o C. HemoTempR II BMD is non-reusable and must be replaced each time the blood bag is returned to the blood bank and reissued.

3. | HemoTempR II Activator is an electronic, portable block model heater developed to provide a reliable source of heat necessary to activate the Company's HemoTempR II BMD. The HemoTempR II Activator has a thermostatic control to permit precise setting and continuous control of temperatures in the range for activation of the Company's HemoTempR II BMD. This device is intended by the Company to be used with HemoTempR II BMD as a system for blood monitoring. This device is manufactured by another company to specifications set by the Company.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | TempTrendR Temperature Indicator ("TI") is primarily used to monitor the temperature of urine specimens collected for drug testing to detect fraudulent urine specimens. Most common forms of drug testing require a urine specimen. However, the test is valid only if a legitimate urine specimen is collected which has not been altered by the subject to mask a drug abuse problem. In order to eliminate altered or fraudulent urine specimens in tests on federal employees, federal government guidelines require that urine temperature be measured within four minutes of sample collection, and that the temperature be 90.5-98.9o F. Temperature measurements taken with TempTrendR TI are simply a matter of observing the color illuminated number and recording the temperature. TempTrendR TI also provides a non-invasive method of monitoring the actual surface temperature trends of any body surface where temperature measurement is important, such as near joints in rheumatoid arthritis and to assess blood circulation.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | TempTrendR II Temperature Trend Device ("TTD") is a second generation temperature trend device which is correlated to internal body temperature and provides a non-invasive, readily visible means of monitoring changes in body temperature. TempTrendR II TTD will reflect oral temperatures such as those taken by glass thermometers. TempTrendR II TTD is used intraoperatively to warn of developing hyper or hypothermic conditions. The indicator can also be used for monitoring a patient’s temperature during any type of transfusion procedure. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | LabTempR 20 and LabTempR 40 Surface Temperature Indicators ("STI") are designed to reversibly indicate the temperature of laboratory materials which require specific storage or use temperatures. LabTempR 20 STI indicates temperatures between 0-21o C. and LabTempR 40 STI monitors temperatures between 19-21 and 24-41o C. These thermometers are designed to monitor the temperature and changes in temperature of hundreds of laboratory chemicals and supplies which require specific temperature conditions; however, these thermometers are suitable for temperature measurement of any surface.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | StaFreezR Freeze-Thaw Indicator ("FTI") is a freeze-thaw indicator which will irreversibly indicate whether frozen material is warmed to greater than -20 o C. Once the frozen product exceeds -20o C., the liquid crystal indicator will turn from blue to gray to black, and refreezing the product at a lower temperature will not bring back the original frozen state color.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | HemoCoolTM Gel-Pak is a reusable gel pack designed for transporting temperature sensitive materials. The HemoCoolTM Gel-Pak is unique in that it can be used to assist in maintaining the temperature of temperature sensitive materials both during the processing of the materials (labeling, testing, etc.) while outside the refrigerator as well as during transport.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. | HemoCoolTM Gel-Pak for test tubes is a reusable gel pack designed for transporting up to six test tubes while outside of the refrigerator. For example, this use can be valuable for new admissions in hospitals who may have 1 – 6 test tubes of samples collected or large collections which may consist of more than one test tube. These collections can also be isolated using the gel pack.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10. | HemoCoolTM Rollup Gel-Pak for test tubes is a reusable rollup gel pack designed for transporting up to seven test tubes while outside of the refrigerator. This device has the same capability as the Gel-Pak described above and additionally can be rolled up and transported through a pneumatic tube system.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11. | The Company also has the capability of manufacturing on an as needed basis, specialty products including devices manufactured to the specification and design of the customer, such as time/temperature shipping labels for food products under the trade name FoodGardeTM Time/Temperature Indicators and liquid crystal thermometers for general purpose thermometry. The Company is not currently selling any such specialty products.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Products Under Development. The Company is also developing these other products.
 

1. | The Company previously developed a compound intended for use as bacteria growth retardant agents for use in various products and processes. Although these antibacterial compounds are subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation, they are historically designated as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). The Company is not currently producing or selling these compounds. Since there are several unknown factors regarding efficacy, supply and regulatory requirements, the outcome of this project cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The Company is also investigating production methods for the bacteria growth retardant compound described in Paragraph 1 above. In this regard, the Company has developed certain proprietary technology related to the processing of these compounds. On October 14, 2014, the Company was granted a patent “Method of Producing Eggshell Powder” related to the processing and manufacture of bacteria growth retardant compounds for use in food and other products (see “Patents and Trademarks”).
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The Company has recognized a need exists for a simple, inexpensive indicator to determine if sensitive materials have been subjected to freezing temperatures. The Company is continuing its investigation of the feasibility of such an indicator.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | The Company is investigating the feasibility of additional products to systematize the use of its thermometric and thermographic liquid crystal devices as well as alternative technologies to supplement its current product line where the Company’s current products are not suitable. The results of such investigations are not available at this time.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Manufacturing. The Company manufactures all of its products except for the HemoTempR II Activator. This product is manufactured for the Company by an unrelated company on an as needed basis. Raw materials for the Company's other products are purchased, but all manufacturing of these products is performed at the Company's production facility. All outside manufacturing is done to specifications set by the Company. There are no commitments or firm agreements for outside manufacturers to provide products for the Company, and the Company does not anticipate it will enter into any such agreements in the foreseeable future. Currently, the Company relies exclusively on Fred Suzuki, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, to manufacture the temperature sensitive liquid crystals used in the Company’s temperature indicators (See “Material Risk Factors”, below).
 
The Company has forty-three years of experience working with various liquid crystal formulations, thermometric and thermographic application methods and the effect of temperature and other factors on degradable materials. The Company maintains complete records of manufacturing and quality assurance testing of all of its products in compliance with Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations. All products are manufactured according to "good manufacturing practices" ("GMP") for medical devices.
 
Marketing and Distribution. The Company has traditionally targeted the medical and laboratory markets. The Company currently uses marketing tools such as direct mailing, cold calls, public announcements, and its website for introduction of its new products. While novel products, such as the Company's products, enjoy the advantage of no initial competition, they also initially lack a demonstrated market demand and acceptance. Furthermore, cost savings programs have slowed down the introduction of new products, particularly in the medical market. As a result, the time required to achieve acceptance of the Company's medical products has significantly increased, in Management's opinion.
 
Although the Company relies on its own sales and distribution efforts for a portion of its sales, the Company's distributors accounted for a majority of the Company’s net sales in Fiscal 2019. During Fiscal 2019, Fisher Scientific Company (“Fisher”) accounted for 28.4% of the Company's sales. Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”) accounted for 40.1% of Company sales during Fiscal 2019 (See “Material Risk Factors”, below). Management believes distributors will continue to be an important part of the Company’s sales and distribution system in the future.
 
The Company continues to negotiate with various medical and laboratory product companies for the distribution of its products under private labels and to introduce its products in the industrial, pharmaceutical and laboratory markets, the success of which cannot be assured. The Company is attempting to introduce new products to supplement its current product line. The Company is also researching products outside the traditional medical and laboratory markets, the results of which cannot be predicted at this time.
 
During Fiscal 2020, the Company anticipates employees will work part-time in marketing and one employee will devote substantially all of her time to marketing and selling the Company’s products. The Company does not have an outside sales force. Since the Company markets its products to approximately 7,000 hospitals in the United States, hundreds of laboratories and industrial end-users in the United States, and thousands of hospitals and laboratories in foreign countries, it will continue to rely upon the marketing efforts of independent dealers and sales representatives for the medical and laboratory markets. The Company also directly markets and sells to its industrial customers.
 
The Company is unaware of its current market share for its medical and laboratory products.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials. In general, the Company believes its sources and availability of raw materials and finished products to be satisfactory. Presently, there are a limited number of domestic manufacturers of liquid crystal chemicals. Although it is expected that these domestic manufacturers will continue to supply the raw liquid crystals needed for the production of the Company's products, continued supply from such domestic manufacturers cannot be assured. If industrial quantities of raw liquid crystals are unavailable from domestic sources, the Company will need to import these materials from foreign suppliers, or, as an alternative, manufacture such materials itself. There can be no assurance that foreign suppliers will have adequate surplus or availability in the event the Company needs to utilize foreign sources. Other materials and products are currently available from a variety of suppliers (See however “Risk Factors”, below).
Patents and Trademarks. The Company was previously granted or assigned five United States and four foreign patents relating to liquid crystal technology. All of these patents have expired. Although these patents are no longer in effect, management does not believe this will have an adverse material impact on the Company's operations, revenues or properties.
 
The Company currently holds several other patents, including “Method of Producing Eggshell Powder”, Patent Number US 8,859,010, granted October 14, 2014. This patent will expire on May 28, 2024.
 
The Company was also granted a design patent, “Fold-Over Cooling Pack”, Patent Number US D670816, relating to the Company’s HemoCoolTM Gel Pak, on November 13, 2012. This patent will expire on November 13, 2026. In addition, the Company holds several Foreign Design Patents for the “Fold-Over Cooling Pack”, including Europe, Patent Number 002038745-0001, issued August 7, 2012, expiring on May 8, 2037; Canada, Patent Number 145628, issued March 21, 2013, expiring March 21, 2023; Turkey, Patent Number 201203234, issued May 7, 2012, expiring May 7, 2037; and India, Patent Number 245076, issued February 2, 2016, expiring November 8, 2026.
 
The Company was granted a design patent, “Roll-Up Gel Pack for Test Tubes,” Patent Number US D712,559 relating to the Company’s HemoCoolTM Rollup Gel Pak for test tubes, on September 2, 2014. This patent will expire on September 2, 2028. The Company was also granted another design patent, “Roll-Up Gel Pack for Test Tubes,” Patent Number US D726,928 relating to the Company’s HemoCoolTM Rollup Gel Pak for test tubes on April 14, 2015. This patent will expire on April 14, 2029. The Company holds several foreign design patents for the “Roll-Up Gel Pack for Test Tubes,” including Europe, Patent Number 0022951050001, issued November 18, 2013, expiring August 22, 2038; Europe, Patent Number 002295105-0002, issued November 18, 2013, expiring August 22, 2038; India, Patent Number 252643, issued February 5, 2014, expiring March 5, 2028; Canada, Patent Number 150496, issued February 8, 2016, expiring February 8, 2026; Canada, Patent Number 156195, issued February 8, 2016, expiring February 8, 2026; and Turkey, Patent Number 2013/02413, issued March 26, 2013, which expired on March 26, 2018 due to non-payment of maintenance fee.
 
The Company was granted a design patent, “Gel Pack for Test Tubes,” Patent Number US D825071 relating to a design for a gel-pack which holds test tubes, HemoCool™ Gel-Pak for test tubes on August 7, 2018. This patent will expire on August 7, 2032. Design Patents for the “Gel Pak for Test Tubes,” have been issued in India, Patent Number 252644 issued on January 23, 2014, expiring on March 5, 2028; Canada, Patent Number 150495, issued on February 8, 2016, expiring on February 8, 2026; Canada, Patent Number 156173, issued on February 8, 2016, expiring on February 8, 2026; Turkey, Patent Number 2013/02394 issued on March 25, 2013, which expired on March 25, 2018 due to non-payment of maintenance fee; Europe, Patent Number 002295212-0001 issued on November 28, 2013, which expired on August 22, 2018 due to non-payment of maintenance fees, and Patent Number 002295212-0002 issued on November 28, 2013, which expired on August 22, 2018 due to non-payment of maintenance fees.
 
The Company may also seek to obtain patents on other products, as appropriate.
 
The Company has received registered trademark protection on all product names to date excepting Temp-DTekTM, Tempa-SlideTM, FoodGardeTM, LaproVueTM and Hemo-CoolTM. The Company has retained, however, all the common law rights to the ThermolyzerTM, Temp-D-TekTM, Tempa-SlideTM, FoodGardeTM, LaproVueTM, and Hemo-CoolTM trademarks. Additional trademark registrations will be applied for as needed.
 
Patent and trademark protection is important to the Company, both with respect to its current products, as well as products under development. In circumstances where the Company is unable to obtain patent trademark protection on its products, as well as any improvements, developments and modifications related to such products if the Company is able to sell such products without initial significant competition, then the Company believes no material adverse effects to the Company's operations will result in the event additional patents and/or trademarks are not obtained, or, if obtained, such patents and/or trademarks are held to be invalid. However, certain processes and chemical formulas will be maintained only as trade secrets. Management feels that it will be difficult for potential competitors to analyze or reproduce certain secret processes and formulas without substantial expenditure of capital and resources.
 
Seasonable Aspect of Business. The business of the Company is not seasonal.
 
Working Capital Items. The Company has attempted to conserve working capital whenever possible. To this end, the Company attempts to keep inventory at minimum levels. The Company believes that it will be able to maintain adequate inventory to supply its customers on a timely basis by careful planning and forecasting demand for its products. However, the Company is nevertheless required, as is customary in the medical and laboratory industries, to carry inventory to meet the delivery requirements of customers and thus, inventory represents a substantial portion of the Company's current assets.
 
The Company generally grants payment terms to customers and dealers. The Company will not accept returns of products from its dealers except for change or credit but does guarantee the quality of its products to the end user for a period of one year. In addition, the Company maintains product liability insurance at a level which the Company’s management believes is adequate protection for the Company’s product liability exposure.
 
As of April 30, 2019, the Company had $1,646,824 of current assets available. Of this amount, $57,658 represented prepaid expenses, $162,678 was inventory, $246,363 was net trade receivables, and $1,180,125 represented cash.
 
Management of the Company believes that it has sufficient working capital to continue operations for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020 provided the Company's sales and ability to collect accounts receivable are not adversely affected. In the event the Company's sales materially decrease, the receivables of the Company are materially impaired for any reason, or the Company needs additional capital for its development projects, it may be necessary to obtain additional financing to cover working capital items and keep current trade accounts payable, of which there can be no assurance. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
 
Major Customers. The Company’s two largest customers are its primary product distributors, Fisher and Cardinal. Fisher was directly responsible for 28.4% of the Company's net sales during the fiscal year ending April 30, 2019. Cardinal accounted for 40.1% of the Company’s net sales during the fiscal year ending April 30, 2019. At April 30, 2019, Fisher owed the Company $67,633 and Cardinal owed $147,825. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales during Fiscal 2019. Management believes the loss of either of these distributors would materially reduce the revenues of the Company until the Company could retain, if available, the services of other major product distributors or the end users serviced by Fisher and Cardinal began ordering directly from the Company. Management has no reason to believe that the Company will lose either of these distributors in the foreseeable future.
Backlogs. The Company had $640 in backorders at April 30, 2019 and no backorders at April 30, 2018.
 
Government Contracts. The Company does not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government entity.
 
Competition. The Company has no known commercial competitors of its blood monitoring devices using liquid crystal technology. The Company's HEMOTEMPR II BMD (blood bag temperature monitor) competes in the medical market against several functionally similar products. Management of the Company has become aware of one such product sold by a competitor with sales substantially equal to the Company’s sales of HEMOTEMPR II BMD. Management of the Company believes that HEMOTEMPR II BMD is superior because it provides an irreversible monitor with a reversible monitor to warn the user that blood is approaching an unsafe temperature. There are no known commercial competitors of the Company's HemoTempR II Activator.
 
In the area of laboratory temperature monitoring, a known competitor supplies reversible and irreversible temperature indicators. In the area of a food or drink safety indicator, there is no competition known to the Company that utilizes liquid crystal technology. The Company believes that the frozen food industry presently uses primarily physical and organoleptic evaluation (e.g. evaluation of softness, texture, aroma, taste, and the like), as well as mercury thermometers and temperature sensitive inks to monitor freshness. Labels containing wax encapsulated dyes with specific low melting points and capillary action products are produced by several other companies.
 
The Company’s TempTrendR II competes in the medical market against products produced by several other companies. The Company’s TempTrendR competes in the drug testing market, specifically for monitoring the temperature of urine samples, with several other companies utilizing liquid crystal and non-liquid crystal technology.
 
A number of other companies are only involved in the manufacture of liquid crystal raw materials and do not directly compete with the Company for sale of medical, industrial or consumer products. Mercury and electronic thermometers are used in several competitive applications. They are generally more costly, nondisposable or not usable in most applications where liquid crystal thermometry and temperature indicators are utilized.
 
Many of the Company’s competitors may have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The Company’s ability to compete depends on its ability to design, manufacture and sell high quality products as well as its ability to develop new products and functionality that meet evolving customer requirements.
 
Research and Development. During Fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Company spent $160,350 and $169,892, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development activities. All expenditures for research and development are expensed currently with the exception of significant equipment and set-up charges which are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life.
 
The Company is conducting research and development of products discussed under "Products Under Development." Although not anticipated, the Company may require financing to complete the development of these products. The success of the Company in obtaining financing for research and development may largely determine whether the Company will be able to continue the research and development for such products. Management believes the Company has sufficient working capital for anticipated research and development for the ensuing year.
 
Government Regulations. Company products, such as the bacteria growth retarding compound, may require pre-clearance by the FDA or other government agencies. Present medical products of the Company are classified by the FDA as Class I or Class II. These are subject only to general regulations requiring that manufacturers adhere to certain guidelines to provide reasonable assurance of utility, safety, and effectiveness. These guidelines include labeling requirements, registration with the FDA as a manufacturer, listing of devices in commercial distribution with the FDA, notification to FDA of devices proposed to be marketed, conformance to specified current good manufacturing practices in the manufacture of the devices, conformance to certain record-keeping requirements, and, in the case of Class II devices, conformance to certain performance standards. At the present time, the Company believes that it is in compliance with regulations set forth by the FDA.
Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales. The Company made export sales to customers located outside of the United States totaling $72,265 during the last fiscal year and $42,355 during the fiscal year ending in 2018. Export sales were made to customers located in Canada, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Italy, Germany, and Kingdom of Bahrain. The Company also believes that some of its medical devices were sold to distributors within the United States who resold the devices in foreign markets. However, the Company does not have any information regarding such sales, and such sales are not considered to be material.
 
The Company does not rely on any foreign operations other than its dealers and marketing representatives in their respective marketing areas. See "Marketing and Distribution." Foreign sales are contingent upon, among other factors, foreign trade regulations, value of the United States Dollar and, where required, government approval of the Company's products including CE Marketing requirements.
 
Management of the Company believes that export sales may continue to increase in future years. However, the Company is exposed to risks generally attendant to foreign operations, including but not limited to, trade restrictions, tariffs, embargos, foreign war and unrest and competition from foreign and domestic producers, and therefore there is a risk export sales will not continue to increase in the future. Management believes the partial or total loss of foreign operations would not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
 
Environmental Protection Expenditures. The Company's operations are not subject to any federal, state or local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment which materially affect earnings or the competitive position of the Company, although the Company is subject to such laws. There were no material capital expenditures made during the last fiscal year to comply with such laws.
Employees. The Company presently has six full-time employees comprised of the President and three Vice Presidents.
 
Website. The Company maintains a Website at www.biosynergyinc.com. The Company makes available on its Website free of charge its annual report on form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 78o(d)). The Company will provide electronic or paper copies of its filings free of charge upon request.
 
Reports to Shareholders. The Company is not required to deliver annual reports to its shareholders. Historically, the Company has not delivered annual reports to its shareholders and does not intend to do so this year. However, all written material filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission may be read and copied at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Public Reference Room at 450 5th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Such information may also be obtained from the Public Reference Room by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or by visiting the Securities and Exchange Commission’s internet site at www.sec.gov. You may obtain copies of this Annual Report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by contacting the Company at 1940 East Devon Avenue, Elk Grove Village, Illinois 60007, telephone number 847-956-0471.
