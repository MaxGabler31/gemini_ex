We also serve customers in various other industries such as petrochemical, sulfur, mining and minerals companies engaged primarily in the extraction of non-ferrous metals, aerospace and defense, cement, agriculture, and other industrial customers. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, industrial cleaning services, engineering, fabrication, and capital construction.
•Storage and Terminal Solutions: consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks and terminals. We also include work related to cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals, including LNG, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum, hydrogen and other specialty vessels such as spheres in this segment, as well work related to marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication, construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer tank products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.
OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS
Customers and Marketing
We provided services to approximately 400 customers in fiscal 2022. Most of our revenue comes from long-term customer relationships. One customer accounted for $87.2 million or 12.3% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022, which was primarily included in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment. Another customer accounted for $78.1 million or 11.0% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022, all of which was included in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment. No other customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data, Note 13 - Segment Information, for more information about concentration of revenue by segment.
We market our services and products primarily through our marketing and business development personnel, senior professional staff and our operating management. We competitively bid most of our projects; however, we have a number of preferred provider relationships with customers who award us work through long-term agreements. Our projects have durations ranging from a few days to multiple years.
Competition
We compete with local, regional, national and international contractors and service providers. Competitors vary with the markets we serve with few competitors competing in all of the markets we serve or in providing all of the services we provide. Contracts are generally awarded based on price, quality, safety performance, schedule, experience and customer satisfaction.
Backlog
We define backlog as the total dollar amount of revenue that we expect to recognize as a result of performing work that has been awarded to us through a signed contract, limited notice to proceed ("LNTP") or other type of assurance that we consider firm. The following arrangements are considered firm:
•fixed-price awards;
•minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and
•certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amounts.
For long-term maintenance contracts with no minimum commitments and other established customer agreements, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months. For arrangements in which we have received a LNTP, we include the entire scope of work in our backlog if we conclude that the likelihood of the full project proceeding as high. For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenue recognized as of the reporting date.

The following table provides a summary of changes in our backlog in fiscal 2022:

 | Utility and Power Infrastructure | | Process and Industrial Facilities | | Storage and TerminalSolutions | | Total

Book-to-bill ratio(1) | 0.7 | | | 1.6 | | | 1.2 | | 1.2 

(1)Calculated by dividing project awards by revenue recognized.
In the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment, backlog decreased by 40.0% as we booked $152.1 million of project awards in fiscal 2022. Our opportunity pipeline for LNG peak shaving projects continues to be promising, however those awards, while significant, can be less frequent. Bidding activity is strong in the power delivery portion of the business. During fiscal 2022, we received several key contracts for electrical infrastructure services including substation and transmission line rebuilds, relay upgrades, and fiber installation.
In the Process and Industrial Facilities segment, backlog increased by 116.9% as we booked $412.4 million of project awards in fiscal 2022. Client spending related to refinery maintenance operations has returned to near-normal pre-pandemic levels. During fiscal 2022, we received key awards for two thermal vacuum chamber projects, a midstream gas processing plant, a borate mining facility, a refinery capital project, and other renewable energy capital projects. We continue to see strong demand for thermal vacuum chambers in the coming quarters, as well as increasing opportunities in mining and minerals, and chemicals. In addition, we are seeing more opportunities for midstream gas work, including some larger scale projects.
In the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment, backlog increased by 23.7% as we booked $270.2 million of project awards during fiscal 2022. This segment includes significant opportunities for storage infrastructure projects related to natural gas, LNG, ammonia, hydrogen, NGLs and other forms of renewable energy. We believe LNG and hydrogen projects in particular will be key growth drivers for this segment. Bidding activity on LNG projects has been strong and we have been positioning ourselves for growth in hydrogen by entering into key relationships, such as the signing of a memorandum of understanding ("MOU") with Korea Gas Corporation in August 2022 to support South Korea’s development of a hydrogen economy as it transforms itself from natural gas and the signing of a MOU with Chart Industries, Inc. in January of 2021 to support the development of hydrogen solutions. Oil and natural gas producers have remained cautious with capital spending, which has limited opportunities in crude oil tanks and terminals. However, the price of crude oil and natural gas increased significantly during fiscal 2022, which, if sustained, may lead to higher production volumes and more opportunities for crude oil tanks, terminals and export facilities in the coming quarters. 
Project awards in all segments are cyclical and are typically the result of a sales process that can take several months or years to complete. It is common for awards to shift from one period to another as the timing of awards is dependent upon a number of factors including changes in market conditions, permitting, off take agreements, project financing and other factors. Backlog volatility may increase for some segments from time to time when individual project awards are less frequent, but more significant. We expect to recognize approximately 83% of our total backlog reported as of June 30, 2022 as revenue within fiscal 2023.
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our operating results can exhibit seasonal fluctuations, especially in our Process and Industrial Facilities segment, for a variety of reasons. Turnarounds and planned outages at customer facilities are typically scheduled in the spring and the fall when the demand for energy is lower. Within the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment, transmission and distribution work is generally scheduled by the public utilities when the demand for electricity is at its lowest. Therefore, revenue volume in the summer months is typically lower than in other periods throughout the year.
Our business can also be affected, both positively and negatively, by seasonal factors such as energy demand or weather conditions including hurricanes, snowstorms, and abnormally low or high temperatures. Some of these seasonal factors may cause some of our offices and projects to close or reduce activities temporarily. In addition to the above noted factors, the general timing of project starts and completions could exhibit significant fluctuations.
Table of Contents

Other factors impacting operating results in all segments come from decreased work volume during holidays, work site permitting delays or customers accelerating or postponing work. The differing types, sizes, and durations of our contracts, combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion, often results in fluctuations in our operating results.
Our overhead cost structure is generally fixed. Significant fluctuations in revenue volume usually leads to over or under recovery of fixed overhead costs, which can have a material impact on our gross margin and profitability.
Material Sources and Availability
The COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand and competition for qualified labor have resulted in disruptions to global supply chains, which have led to higher prices for some of the materials we need to run our business, including, but not limited to, structural steel, steel piping, rebar, valves, copper, electrical components, fabricated products and equipment, and delivery freight. We have been proactive with managing our procurement processes to help reduce the impacts of rising materials prices on our business and to help ensure we continue to have the materials we need available. However, rising prices and the potential for materials shortages have created additional risk into bidding and executing work profitably.
The timing of normalization of the global supply chains is uncertain and will depend on several factors, including the speed of recovery from the pandemic, producer capacity, the level of imports, worldwide demand, tariffs on imported goods and other market conditions.
Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations. However, exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits.
Typically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide warranties for materials. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or to provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects. We maintain a performance and payment bonding line sufficient to support the business. We generally require our subcontractors to indemnify us and our customers and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure the subcontractors’ work. There can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers.
Human Capital Management
Employees
Successful execution of our business strategy is dependent on attracting, developing, and retaining key employees who represent our core values and the communities we serve. Our people are our greatest resource, which makes our certification in fiscal 2022 as a Great Place To Work® — for the sixth consecutive year — both a point of pride and an invaluable tool for continuous improvement supporting our objective of remaining an employer of choice.
Given the nature of our work, the size of our employee population can vary significantly throughout the year because of the number, type, and size of projects we have in progress at any particular time. As of June 30, 2022, we had 2,810 employees worldwide. Of those employees, 677 were employed in office-based positions and 2,133 were employed in field or craft positions. The breakdown by country was: 2,467 located in the United States, 309 in Canada, and 34 across other international locations. At the end of fiscal 2022, 45% of our overall workforce and 28% of our management team was represented by women and minorities. Recognizing that commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) begins at the top, in fiscal 2022, Matrix increased the overall diversity of our Independent Board Members to 43%, with 29% female and 14% ethnically diverse.
The percentage of our employees represented by unions as of June 30, 2022, was approximately 30%. Operating under collective bargaining agreements with various unions, our union employees are provided with benefits including health and welfare, pension, training programs and competitive compensation plans. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years and are proud that our relationships with our employees and labor unions are strong.

Business Ethics and Core Values
Our employees are entrusted with engineering, constructing, and maintaining the complex, critical infrastructure that supports modern daily living and quality of life. Ethics and integrity are foundational in our ability to be successful and are engrained in our culture and core values. Across all areas of our business, we maintain focus on compliance and doing the right thing, and integrity is essential to every aspect of our business, in both policy and practice. Accordingly, we are committed to ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and to maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct in accordance with our code of conduct.
Health and Safety
Ensuring the safety of our employees and those around us is integral to who we are, and paramount to our success and sustainability. The journey to achieving and maintaining a zero-incident safety performance requires robust training along with comprehensive policies, processes, and systems to plan, perform, report, measure, review, and improve our performance. We have incorporated safety as a key performance metric in our incentive compensation plan by measuring our annual Total Recordable Incident Rate (‘‘TRIR’’), which is calculated by multiplying the number of recordable incidents by 200,000 and dividing that number by the total hours worked each year. This metric is also used by others in our industry, which allows for a more objective comparison of our performance. Our TRIR was 0.51, 0.28, and 0.50 during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
Foundational to attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse, engaged workforce is our commitment to making sure our employees feel safe, know they are valued, that their work matters, and that they are provided opportunities to achieve their maximum potential. We believe when we value each other’s differences and encourage everyone’s voice to be heard, we can break down the barriers that stifle ideas and opportunities.
In fiscal 2022, we continued to advance and strengthen our culture. We launched our first Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), creating employee-led pathways for inclusion. We also continued year-round learning opportunities on unconscious bias and other DEI-specific topics and enhanced our DEI education offering available to all employees through Matrix University. We strengthened our accountability by increasing the diversity of our independent Board Members based on gender and ethnicity; establishing our ERG Executive Sponsor Program; advancing development of an employee survey designed to measure effectiveness of our DEI efforts and setting the framework for data analysis to identify opportunities for improvement. We also continued our participation in CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion and participated in a variety of community events including Advancing Oklahoma, a state-wide conversation on race, where Matrix leadership served on the committee that developed comprehensive programming to engage participants in discussions about race and history, the criminal justice system, everyday conversations, education, business, image and attitudes, advocacy, and the future.
Total Rewards Package
As part of our compensation philosophy and to attract and retain superior talent, we offer and maintain market-competitive total rewards programs for our employees. In addition to base salaries, additional programs include incentive and project bonus opportunities, comprehensive healthcare coverage and insurance benefits, Company matched retirement plans, health savings and flexible spending accounts, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, paid holidays and other paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules where possible. Other offerings include employee assistance programs with 365/24/7 access to resources and support, and Matrix HealthMatters, our robust wellness program that provides resources and education to help employees and their families get and stay healthy, focusing wholistically on physical, mental and financial health.
Training and Employee Development Programs
Investment in continuous learning is essential to providing industry-leading expertise and service to our clients, continuous improvement across our organization, and meaningful career development opportunities for our people. From in-person to online courses, formalized and other specialized training, our employees benefit from opportunities to strengthen their leadership and management competencies, improve communication and interpersonal skills, and advance their technical proficiency. Through Matrix University, our people have access to resources that include a robust Learning Management System (LMS) that provides enterprise-wide access for employees to a number of online learning modules and support tools.
Our employees also benefit from the Matrix Performance Development Program, designed for collaborative development of annual performance goals and to promote continuous, transparent feedback between employees and their supervisors.
Table of Contents

Employee Engagement
We also empower our employees to donate time, talent, and resources through Company-led initiatives, employee matching, and paid volunteer time off. Each year, our employees collectively log thousands of hours participating in individual community service projects in addition to hours they invest serving on boards and participating in Company-sponsored charitable events. We also provide direct corporate financial support to nonprofit organizations in the communities where we live and work.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Our subsidiaries have several patents and continue to pursue new ideas and innovations to better serve our customers in several areas of our business. The Flex-A-Span® and Flex-A-Seal® trademarks are utilized to market our unique seals for floating roof tanks. The FastFroth® trademark is utilized to market our unique industrial cleaning process. The Flowdome® trademark is used to market our geodesic dome tank roofs. Our SwingMaster® trademark is used to market our central type swing joints. The patent for the Training Tank for Personnel Entry, Exit and Rescue relates to a training device that can be used to train personnel on equipment that is made to simulate confined space scenarios. We hold two separate patents for Pipe Lifting and Orienting Apparatus and Method that is used to raise and lower pipes and to move them around the upper surface of floating roof of tanks. The Batten Joint for an Internal Floating Roof of a Fluid Tank allows us to overcome many of the disadvantages associated with other types of joints used for internal floating roofs for floating tanks.
We also hold a perpetual license to use various patents and technologies related to LNG storage tanks, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen storage tanks, liquid petroleum gas storage tanks and thermal vacuum chambers. 
While our intellectual property is not our main business, we believe that the ability to use these patents, trademarks, and technology enables us to expand our presence in the markets we serve and minimizes the development costs typically associated with organic growth.
Regulation
Health and Safety Regulations
Our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation, and to regulation under state laws and by the Canadian Workers’ Compensation Board and its Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted strict and comprehensive safety regulations. We have established and consistently reinforce and monitor compliance with comprehensive programs intended to ensure that we comply with all applicable health and safety regulations to protect the safety of our workers, subcontractors and customers. While we believe that we operate safely and prudently, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our businesses. In order to minimize the financial exposure resulting from potential accidents associated with our work, we maintain liability insurance to limit losses that could result from our work.
Environmental
We believe we have an obligation to better the world in which we live and work – to do today’s work in a manner that advances and protects tomorrow’s world for future generations. Across our organization, from our project sites to our offices, we are committed to environmental stewardship and to continuously seeking better, more sustainable ways to perform our work in existing and new markets, including renewables.
Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials.
In order to limit costs incurred as a result of environmental exposure, we maintain contractor’s pollution liability insurance that covers liability that may be incurred as a result of accidental releases of hazardous materials.
We believe that we are currently in compliance, in all material aspects, with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect any material charges in subsequent periods relating to environmental conditions that currently exist and do not currently foresee any significant future capital spending relating to environmental matters.
