Item 1. Business
Our Company
 We are the second largest publicly-traded lodging real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a diverse portfolio of iconic and market-leading hotels and resorts with significant underlying real estate value. We were originally formed as Hilton Hotels Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and existed as a part of one of Hilton’s business segments. On January 3, 2017, Hilton Parent completed the spin-off that resulted in our establishment as an independent, publicly traded company. As of February 18, 2022, our portfolio consists of 54 premium-branded hotels and resorts with approximately 32,000 rooms, located in prime United States (“U.S.”) markets with high barriers to entry. Over 86% of our rooms are luxury and upper upscale and all of our rooms are located in the U.S. and its territories. We are focused on consistently delivering superior risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet.
 On September 18, 2019, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 5, 2019, by and among Park Parent, PK Domestic Property LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Park Parent (“PK Domestic”), PK Domestic Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PK Domestic (“Merger Sub”) and Chesapeake Lodging Trust (“Chesapeake”), Chesapeake merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”). Park Intermediate Holdings LLC (our “Operating Company”) continues to directly or indirectly hold all of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Park Parent owned 100% of the interests in our Operating Company until December 31, 2021 when the business undertook an internal reorganization transitioning our structure to a traditional umbrella partnership REIT structure ("UPREIT"). Effective January 1, 2022, Park Parent became the sole general partner and a limited partner of our Operating Company and PK Domestic REIT Inc., a direct subsidiary of Park Parent, became a limited partner. In the future, we may from time-to-time issue limited partnership units ("OP Units") through our Operating Company in connection with acquiring hotels, financing, compensation or other purposes. As of December 31, 2021, Park Parent and PK Domestic REIT Inc. collectively owned 100% of the limited partnership interests of our Operating Company.
 We are a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have been organized and operated, and we expect to continue to be organized and operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT.
 
Our Business and Growth Strategies
 Our objective is to be the preeminent lodging REIT, focused on consistently delivering superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. We intend to pursue this objective through the following strategies:

•Operational Excellence through Active Asset Management. We are focused on continually improving the operating performance and profitability of each of our hotels and resorts through our proactive asset management efforts. The novel strain of coronavirus and the disease it causes (“COVID-19”) continued to challenge the lodging industry in 2021. Working with our hotel managers, we have adapted our operational approach and implemented measures in an effort to ensure the safety of both hotel guests and employees and minimize our losses. During 2020, we temporarily halted operations at a majority of our hotels located in challenged markets where hotel lodging demand remained muted; consolidated demand into fewer hotels in markets where we have multiple assets; reduced available rooms at hotels to help mitigate expenses; consolidated or eliminated managerial positions to reduce payroll; and reimagined the operating model such as through limiting food and beverage operations and adjusting housekeeping availability for both safety considerations and cost controls. Throughout 2021 we made progress toward recovery, as we strategically reopened all except two of our hotels while our portfolio as a whole has generated positive Hotel Adjusted EBITDA for the past three consecutive quarters. We continue to identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and drive cost efficiencies to maximize the operating performance, cash flow and value of each property. As a pure-play lodging real estate company with significant financial resources and an extensive portfolio of large, multi-use assets, including 9 hotels with 125,000 square feet of meeting space or more, we believe our ability to implement compelling return on investment initiatives represents a significant embedded growth opportunity. These may include the expansion of meeting platforms in convention and resort markets; the upgrade or redevelopment of existing amenities, including retail platforms, food and beverage outlets, pools and other facilities; the development of vacant land into income-generating uses, including retail or mixed-use properties; or the redevelopment or optimization of underutilized spaces. Our current expansion project at the Bonnet Creek complex in Orlando, Florida includes additional meeting space for the Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek and the Waldorf Astoria Orlando project. We also may create value through repositioning certain hotels across brands or chain scale segments and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities to ensure our assets achieve their highest and best use. Finally, we are focused on maintaining the competitive strength of our properties and adapting to evolving customer preferences 


by renovating properties to provide updated guestroom design, open and activated lobby areas, food and beverage and public spaces, and modernized meeting space.
 •Pursuing Growth and Diversification through Prudent Capital Allocation. We intend to leverage our scale, liquidity and transaction expertise to create value throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions, which we believe will enable us to further diversify our portfolio. In September 2019, we completed the $2.5 billion acquisition of Chesapeake, which helped us to increase our scale and achieve greater diversification. Since our spin-off, we have sold or otherwise disposed of 29 hotels, most of them located in lower growth domestic and non-core international markets for a combined sales price of approximately $1.7 billion. Specifically in 2021, we sold five hotels for $477 million in gross proceeds, exceeding our goal of completing $300 to $400 million of asset sales in 2021, providing us with liquidity to de-leverage our balance sheet and to execute on a variety of strategic corporate initiatives. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we deferred $150 million of the $200 million in capital expenditures previously budgeted for 2020 and reduced capital expenditures for maintenance projects to approximately $44 million for 2021. We will continue to opportunistically seek to expand our presence in target markets and further diversify over time, including by acquiring hotels that are affiliated with leading hotel brands and operators. 
 •Maintaining a Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet. We intend to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. We will focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity with minimal short-term maturities and intend to have a mix of debt that will provide us with the flexibility to prepay debt when desired, dispose of assets, pursue our value enhancement strategies within our existing portfolio, and support acquisition activity. To increase liquidity and extend debt maturities while dealing with the effects of COVID-19, we drew $1 billion from our revolving credit facility (“Revolver”) in March 2020 (which we subsequently fully repaid). In May 2020, we issued $650 million of senior secured notes due 2025 (“2025 Senior Secured Notes”) (a portion of which was used to partially repay amounts outstanding under our Revolver and the term loan due December 2021 (“2016 Term Loan”)). In September 2020, we issued $725 million of senior secured notes due 2028 (“2028 Senior Secured Notes”) (a portion of which was used to repay the remaining amount outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan in full as well as a portion of the Revolver) and extended almost 90% of the Revolver commitments until 2023. In May 2021, we issued $750 million of senior secured notes due 2029 ("2029 Senior Secured Notes," collectively with the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the "Senior Secured Notes") (a portion of which was used to repay a portion of the Revolver and a portion of our unsecured delayed draw term loan facility ("2019 Term Facility")). Additionally, in 2021, we sold five consolidated hotels, and net proceeds were used to repay the remaining outstanding amounts under the Revolver and partially repay the 2019 Term Facility, leaving just $78 million outstanding on our sole remaining corporate term loan. Only 2% of our total outstanding debt is maturing in 2022. We are maintaining higher than historical cash levels due to the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, and we intend to do so until markets stabilize and demand in the lodging industry significantly recovers. Additionally, we expect to reduce our level of secured debt over time, which will provide additional balance sheet flexibility. Our senior management team has extensive experience managing capital structures over multiple lodging cycles and has extensive and long-standing relationships with numerous lending institutions and financial advisors to address our capital needs.

Hotel Laundry Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we permanently closed operations at our three commercial laundry facilities located in Piscataway, New Jersey, Portage, Indiana, and Portland, Oregon. Revenue from our commercial laundry operations accounted for less than half a percent of our consolidated revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Sustainability

We incorporate sustainability into our investment and asset management strategies, with a focus on minimizing environmental impact. When we evaluate the acquisition of new properties, we will assess both sustainability opportunities and climate change-related risks as part of our due diligence process. During the ownership of our properties, we seek to invest in proven sustainability practices in our redevelopment projects that can enhance asset value, while also improving environmental performance. In such projects, we target specific environmental efficiency enhancements, equipment upgrades and replacements that reduce energy and water consumption and offer appropriate returns on investment. We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and

minimizing our impact on the environment. Our approach to corporate citizenship is reinforced by periodic engagement with key stakeholders to understand their corporate responsibility priorities. We participated in the 2021 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark ("GRESB") assessment, ranking in the top 35% of all GRESB participant companies, and increased our score compared to 2020. Additionally, we were recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for the third consecutive year, ranking in the top third of all selected companies.

We have published our 2021 Annual Corporate Responsibility Report on our website, which discloses our environmental and social programs and performance and includes our first Task Force report on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. As highlighted in our report, in 2020, we saw continued decreases in energy and water consumption and intensity across our portfolio, as well as continued decreases in carbon emissions and waste generated. Operations at a significant portion of our portfolio were temporarily suspended for various durations throughout 2020, driving the reductions in utility consumption and intensities. However, the trend of decreasing consumption and intensities is not limited to 2020. Our efforts to responsibly manage our environmental impact is reflected in the continued year-over-year decreases in these metrics. Park has created a Green Sustainability Playbook, which outlines the Company’s sustainability expectations and processes for its brand and management partners on a variety of topics, including HVAC equipment, LED lighting and water efficiency. Park has also created a set of Engineering Renovation Guidelines, which address opportunities for incorporating sustainable building attributes during renovations, such as the use of green materials and efficiency standards for HVAC systems, toilets and showers.
 
Additionally, while non-essential capital expenditure projects were largely suspended or cancelled during 2020 due to cost elimination and cash efficiency measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to invest in efficiency projects related to end-of-life equipment replacements or upgrades. With these projects, we were often able to notably decrease our environmental impact by replacing older equipment with more efficient options. In 2020, completion of more than 20 capital expenditure projects, with a total investment in excess of $4 million, helped to improve the overall efficiency of our portfolio. These projects, conducted at 15 of our hotels, are expected to generate average cost savings of 3 – 4% annually, while larger projects, such as chiller retrofits or replacements, are expected to generate energy cost savings of approximately 20% annually.
 
Our Principal Agreements

In order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, independent third parties must operate substantially all of our hotels. We lease substantially all of our hotels to our TRS lessees, which, in turn have engaged independent third-parties to operate these hotels pursuant to management agreements. The hotels not leased to our TRS lessees are owned by TRSs, which have also engaged independent third-parties to operate these hotels pursuant to management agreements. Certain of our hotels also have franchise agreements. We may, in the future, re-flag existing properties, acquire additional properties that operate under other brands and/or engage other third-party hotel managers and franchisors.

Below is a general overview of our management and franchise agreements.

Management Agreements
   Our hotel managers control the day-to-day operations of our hotels that are subject to a management agreement. We have consultative and specified approval rights with respect to certain actions of our hotel managers, including entering into long-term or high value contracts, engaging in certain actions relating to legal proceedings, approving the operating budget, making certain capital expenditures and the hiring of certain management personnel.

As in our franchise agreements described below, we receive a variety of services and benefits under our management agreements with our hotel managers, including the benefit of the name, marks and system of operation of the brand, as well as centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, as well as training of personnel and payroll and accounting services.

Term

Our management agreements have initial terms ranging from 5 to 30 years and most allow for one or more renewal periods. Assuming all renewal periods are exercised by our hotel managers, the total term of our management agreements range between 5 and 70 years.
Fees

Our management agreements generally contain a two-tiered fee structure, where our hotel managers receive a base management fee and an incentive management fee. The base management fee for our hotels range from approximately 2% to 4% of gross hotel revenues or receipts, as defined in each agreement. The incentive management fee is typically a percentage of a specified performance measure such as operating income, cash flow or other performance measures, as defined in the agreements with some agreements only providing for incentive fees following the satisfaction of certain dollar thresholds. We also pay certain service fees to our hotel managers and generally reimburse our hotel managers for salaries and wages of their employees at our hotels, as well as for certain other expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the hotel.
Termination Events

Subject to certain qualifications, notice requirements and applicable cure periods, the management agreements generally are terminable by either party upon a material casualty or condemnation of the hotel or the occurrence of certain customary events of default, including, among others: the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party; the failure of either party to make a payment when due, and failure to cure such non-payment after late payment notice; or breach by either party of covenants or obligations under the management agreement. In certain instances, we retain the right to terminate a management agreement if manager fails to meet specified performance criteria.
 
Additionally, our hotel managers generally have the right to terminate the management agreement in certain situations, including the occurrence of certain actions with respect to a mortgage or our failing to complete or commence required repair after damage or destruction to the hotel, or our failure to meet minimum brand standards. For certain properties, our management agreements also allow early termination, subject to entering into a franchise agreement with an affiliated brand. If our hotel managers terminate due to our default, our hotel managers may exercise all of their rights and remedies at law or in equity.

Sale of a Hotel

Our management agreements generally provide that we cannot sell a hotel to a person who (i) does not have sufficient financial resources, (ii) is of bad moral character, (iii) is a competitor of our hotel managers, or (iv) is a specially designated national or blocked person, as set forth in the applicable management agreement. It is generally an event of default if we proceed with a sale or an assignment of the hotel’s management agreement to such a transferee, without receiving consent from our hotel managers.

Franchise Agreements

Nine of our hotels are subject to franchise agreements. Pursuant to the franchise agreements, we have been granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use our franchisor’s brand names, marks and systems. The franchisor also may provide us with a variety of services and benefits, including centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, as well as training of personnel. In return, we are required to operate franchised hotels consistent with the applicable brand standards. The franchise agreements specify operational, record-keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which we must comply, and will promote consistency across the brand by outlining standards for guest services, products, signage and furniture, fixtures and equipment, among other things. To monitor our compliance, the franchise agreements specify that we must make the hotel available for quality inspections by the franchisor.
Term

Our franchise agreements contain an initial term of between 13 and 20 years and require the franchisor’s consent to be extended.

Fees

Our franchise agreements require that we pay a royalty fee on gross rooms revenue at rates ranging from 4% to 6%, plus a percentage of food and beverage revenue for certain hotels, which in most cases is 3%. We must also pay certain marketing, reservation, program and other customary fees. In addition, the franchisor has the right to require that we renovate guest rooms and public facilities from time to time to comply with then-current brand standards.
Termination Events

Our franchise agreements provide for termination at the franchisor’s option upon the occurrence of certain events, including, among others: the failure to maintain brand standards; the failure to pay royalties and fees or to perform other obligations under the

franchise license; bankruptcy; and abandonment of the franchise or a change of control, and in the event of such termination, we are required to pay liquidated damages.

Spin-Off Related Agreements
    On January 3, 2017, Hilton Parent completed the spin-off that resulted in our establishment as an independent, publicly traded company.
    Distribution Agreement
 
We entered into a distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) with Hilton Parent regarding the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement provided for certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by us and Hilton Parent and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among Hilton Parent and us. In particular, the Distribution Agreement provided that, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Distribution Agreement:
•all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the separated real estate business were retained by or transferred to us; 
 •all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the timeshare business were retained by or transferred to HGV Parent or its subsidiaries; 
 •all other assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) of Hilton were retained by or transferred to Hilton Parent or its subsidiaries; 
 •liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) related to, arising out of or resulting from businesses of Hilton that were previously terminated or divested were allocated among the parties to the extent formerly owned or managed by or associated with such parties or their respective businesses; 
 •each of Park Parent and HGV Parent assumed or retained any liabilities (including under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws) relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Form 10 registering its common stock to be distributed by Hilton Parent in the spin-off and from any disclosure documents that offered for sale securities in transactions related to the spin-off, subject to exceptions for certain information for which Hilton Parent retained liability; and 
 •except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement, we retained responsibility for any costs or expenses incurred by us following the distribution in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, including costs and expenses relating to legal counsel, financial advisors and accounting advisory work related to the distribution. 
 
In addition, notwithstanding the allocation described above, we, HGV and Hilton have agreed that losses related to certain contingent liabilities (and related costs and expenses), which generally are not specifically attributable to any of the separated real estate business, the timeshare business or the retained business of Hilton (“Shared Contingent Liabilities”), will be apportioned among the parties according to fixed percentages of 65%, 26% and 9% for each of Hilton, us and HGV, respectively. Examples of Shared Contingent Liabilities may include uninsured losses arising from actions (including derivative actions) against current or former directors or officers of Hilton in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the distribution date, or against current or former directors or officers of any of Hilton, HGV or us, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to, the spin-offs and the distribution, subject to certain exceptions described in the Distribution Agreement. In addition, costs and expenses of, and indemnification obligations to, third party professional advisors arising out of the foregoing actions may also be subject to these provisions. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton shall generally be vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense.

The Distribution Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company.
 
Tax Matters Agreement
 
We entered into a tax matters agreement (“Tax Matters Agreement”) with Hilton Parent, HGV Parent and Hilton Domestic Operating Company that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of us, Hilton Parent and HGV Parent after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Although binding between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement

is not binding on the IRS. We and HGV Parent have joint and several liability with Hilton Parent to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Hilton consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we were part of that group. The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which we bear responsibility, and each party has agreed to indemnify the other against any amounts for which they are not responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off is not tax-free. In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, and certain other relevant provisions of the Code, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party’s stock). The parties share responsibility in accordance with sharing percentages for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a particular party.
 
The Tax Matters Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities with respect to tax matters that, except as otherwise provided in the Tax Matters Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the tax-related obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company.

(1) Reflects the terms of a master lease agreement pursuant to which we lease the following five hotels: the Hilton Salt Lake City Center; the DoubleTree Hotel Seattle Airport; the DoubleTree Hotel San Diego—Mission Valley; the DoubleTree Hotel Sonoma Wine Country; and the DoubleTree Hotel Durango.
 (2) The renewal option may be exercised for less than all 5 of the hotels. Minimum rent is reduced if the renewal option is exercised for less than all of the 5 hotels.
 (3) The term of this renewal option exceeds the expiration of the underlying master ground lease in 2031. No extension rights are available, and it is unlikely that the landlord under the master ground lease will grant a term past 2031.
 (4) Tenant has a right of first offer with respect to the property.
 (5) Lease expires on January 30, 2026; however, the renewal rights are included in the current lease term expiration as the landlord has the option to renew the lease.
(6) Renewal rights are dependent on the amount of capital expenditures invested in the hotel during the term.

We (or certain joint ventures in which we own an interest) are also party to certain leases for facilities related to certain hotels owned by us (or such joint ventures).

Competition

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests on the basis of several factors, including the attractiveness of the facility, location, level of service, quality of accommodations, amenities, food and beverage options

and outlets, public and meeting spaces and other guest services, consistency of service, room rate, brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands primarily in the upper upscale chain scale segments. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and RevPAR of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability. We believe our hotels enjoy certain competitive advantages as a result of being flagged with globally recognized brands, including access to centralized reservation systems and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, strong hotel management expertise and guest loyalty programs.
 
Our principal competitors include hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including other lodging REITs) and national and international hotel brands. We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations, such as select-service hotels or independently managed hotels, during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. Increasingly, we also face competition from peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to stay at homes and apartments booked from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms. We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity investors, institutional pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and numerous local, regional and national owners, including franchisors, in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During the recovery phase of the lodging cycle, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers.

Seasonality

The lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause fluctuations in our hotel rooms revenues, occupancy levels, room rates, operating expenses and cash flows. The periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location.
Cyclicality

The lodging industry is cyclical and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic indicators. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given segments of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners of hotel properties. As a result, in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues.
Government Regulations

Our business is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations (in the U.S. and Puerto Rico). In particular, we are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain U.S. federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after January 26, 1993. Public accommodations built before January 26, 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is “readily achievable.” The regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe. The failure of a property to comply with the ADA could result in injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. Any imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures could result in reputational harm or otherwise materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations.

In addition, a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants, including safety and health standards, as well as the sale of liquor at such properties, by requiring licensing, registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. We are also subject to privacy and data security laws. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations (in the U.S. and Puerto Rico) and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern our operations including any associated air emissions; the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic

substances and petroleum projects; and wastewater disposal. In addition, as a current and former owner of property, we could be subject to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under local, state and federal environmental laws, as well as personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties associated with environmental compliance or the presence of contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. In addition to our hotel accommodations, we previously operated certain laundry facilities. Some of our properties include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had impacts from current or historical site operations including dry-cleaning facilities, gasoline and auto service stations, underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators, and other operations that may have caused environmental contamination. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination from leaking underground storage tanks or as a result of current or historical dry-cleaning operations, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for treatment or disposal, without regard to whether we complied with environmental laws in sending our wastes to such treatment or disposal sites. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may also be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. We have implemented an on-going operations and maintenance plan that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification, management, and remediation of hazardous materials or petroleum products known or discovered to exist at our properties, as well as costs of complying with various local, state and federal environmental, health and safety laws, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

REIT Qualification

We are a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have been organized and operated, and we expect to continue to be organized and operated, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy requirements related to, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the real estate composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders annually and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To the extent we continue to remain qualified as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income generated by our REIT activities that we distribute annually to our stockholders. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. Refer to “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items.”

Insurance

We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property, including business interruption, terrorism, and other risks with respect to our business for all of our hotels. We also maintain workers’ compensation insurance for our corporate employees, while our managers maintain workers’ compensation insurance for their employees at our hotels. Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks. These policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insured retentions or deductibles. Our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design, development and operation of our hotels.
Human Capital
 
Employees
 
Through ongoing employee development programs, comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, and a focus on our employees’ health and well-being, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives. As of December 31, 2021, we had 80 corporate employees. We believe relations are positive between us and our employees. Our hotel managers are generally responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. During 2021, management of the Select Hotels was transitioned to a third-party hotel management company, and we no longer employ the employees at these hotels. Although we do not employ the employees at our hotels, we still are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor. We believe relations are positive between our third-party hotel managers and their employees. For a discussion of these relationships, refer to “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor, which could increase our operating costs, reduce flexibility of our hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotels and could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.”
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
We value the unique perspectives that a workforce with diverse cultures, ages, genders, and ethnicities brings to our process, and we are committed to enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion at Park. We have a skilled and highly diverse board of nine independent directors, two of whom are gender diverse. In addition, our executive team is comprised of six members, two of whom are gender diverse and three of whom are racially diverse. The following charts summarize the gender and ethnic diversity of our workforce as of December 31, 2021:
    Our commitment to enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion is reflected both in the actions we take within our Company and our efforts in our larger community, such as through recruitment, employee development, mentorship, education, advocacy and community outreach. We have established a Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee, which is comprised of employees at our corporate headquarters and includes members of executive leadership from all corporate departments and a broad assortment of levels, genders, ages and races. The committee is dedicated to enhancing our focus on activities that increase awareness and take actions in support of equality, and it seeks to develop partnerships and adopt new initiatives that support systematic change related to racism and diversity. The committee has spent significant time focusing on actions and commitments that impact Park internally such as recruitment and retention practices, policy and process updates, training and increased communication and awareness programs. All our employees are encouraged to take part in initiatives implemented by the Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee.
 
Additionally, our Chief Executive Officer, Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr. serves as one of the three co-chairs of NAREIT's Dividends Through Diversity, Equity & Inclusion CEO Council, which supports the recruitment, inclusion, development, and advancement of women, Black professionals, other people of color, ethnically diverse individuals, and members of other under-represented groups in REITs and the publicly traded real estate industry.
 
We continually evaluate our practices related to diversity, equity and inclusion through internal and external resources. For example, in 2021, we added a gender and ethnic diversity analysis to our corporate compensation review, which reflected no pay disparity based on any gender or ethnic group. In addition, in 2021, we engaged a third-party resource to perform a diversity audit of Park’s policies, procedures and external websites. The results of the audit found that overall, Park policies and procedures reflect a company that is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that has taken steps to effectuate those goals.

Training and Development
    Human capital development underpins our efforts to successfully execute our Company-wide strategy. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities. We also seek to increase awareness and understanding through Company-wide trainings on diversity and inclusion, unconscious bias and other social issues, as well as an annual anti-bribery/anti-corruption training. In 2021, we added a separate, mandatory training on diversity, equity, inclusion and unconscious bias for corporate employees, and we expanded our training on social issues to include modern slavery/human trafficking awareness. All employees also participate in anti-harassment and compliance training at least once a year.
   Additionally, we provide employees at corporate headquarters with leadership development programs, management development series programs, corporate technical “lunch and learn” trainings, REIT tax training, executive coaching and emotional intelligence training. Our leadership team encourages employees to continue education and professional certifications with time away from work and training budgets. Our Corporate Strategy and Design & Construction departments also participate in sustainability training, including Nareit’s ESG JumpStart workshop and REITworks conference.
      
To support employee development, we provide regular and consistent feedback to our corporate employees through our continuous feedback performance management model. Regular one-on-one feedback sessions are conducted to ensure feedback is current and to reinforce positive performance. We encourage our employees to participate in our Associate Satisfaction and Engagement Survey, which is administered by a third party, and undertake initiatives to improve areas identified in the survey. As a direct result of the survey, each department Executive Committee leader conducts feedback sessions with their respective teams, and Company-wide action plans are created and implemented by our Human Resources department. In addition, each department also creates departmental action plans and implements them accordingly.
 
Our Board of Directors receives regular reports on these initiatives to ensure that we continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to our employees, diversity and inclusion and other human capital matters.
    Health, Safety and Well-being
    We provide benefits to support our corporate employees and their families, including but not limited to medical, vision and dental insurance, gym memberships, a 401(k) match program, paid parental leave, and an employee assistance program. We also provide numerous initiatives focused on physical, mental and spiritual well-being including a flu shot clinic, mindfulness training with dedicated coaches and leaders and emotional intelligence workshops. To support our employees in navigating the challenges of COVID-19, we enhanced components of our health and well-being program. Our expanded program includes Wellness Wednesdays, an initiative targeted to improve physical, social, mental and spiritual wellbeing through bi-weekly Company-wide virtual events. We also provided each corporate employee with a membership to a 24/7 membership-based primary care medical practice with a mission to offer quality care more accessibly.
 
Together with our hotel managers, we also aim to ensure the health, safety and well-being of all employees and guests at our properties. For example, in 2020, we committed to the American Hotel & Lodging Association’s 5-Star Promise, which enhances policies, trainings and resources related to the safety of hotel employees and guests. We aim to promote health and well-being measures in our design and construction projects through the use of natural ventilation, daylighting and air and water quality monitoring. Hotel employee health and safety factors are designed into projects, which include alarm systems cameras, first aid locations and personal alert devices.
 
Community Engagement
    Our Park Cares Committee, a committee comprised of employees at our corporate headquarters, focuses on engagement with local communities and spearheads volunteer work. We introduced an annual event, which aims to concentrate our volunteer efforts around one central cause that all corporate headquarters’ employees can participate in if they desire. While the challenges resulting from COVID-19 temporarily suspended in-person charitable activities in 2020, Park continued to support local communities and organizations in a virtual capacity and through charitable donations. In 2021, we supported over 13 organizations and/or programs through charitable contributions, sponsorships and scholarships contributing a total of $170,000 in cash donations. The hotels within our portfolio are also extremely involved with their respective communities, raising money or donating supplies, food or services as well as contributing countless hours to many worthwhile causes.
