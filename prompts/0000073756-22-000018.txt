GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Oceaneering International, Inc. (“Oceaneering,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a global technology company delivering engineered services and products and robotic solutions to the offshore energy, defense, aerospace, manufacturing and entertainment industries. Oceaneering was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1969 out of the combination of three diving service companies founded in the early 1960s. Since our establishment, we have concentrated on the development and marketing of underwater services and products to meet customer needs requiring the use of advanced technology. The continued evolution of applying our advanced technologies has expanded our presence into numerous adjacent markets focused on autonomous robotics. We believe we are one of the world's largest underwater services contractors. The services and products we provide to the energy industry include remotely operated vehicles, specialty subsea hardware, engineering and project management, subsea intervention services, including manned diving, survey and positioning services, seabed preparation and asset integrity and nondestructive testing services. Our foreign operations, principally in the Africa, Norway, United Kingdom, Brazil, Asia and Australia accounted for approximately 57% of our revenue, or $1.1 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our business segments are contained within two businesses—services and products provided primarily to the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the offshore renewables and mobility solutions industries (“Energy Services and Products”), and services and products provided to non-energy industries (“Aerospace and Defense Technologies”). Our four business segments within the Energy Services and Products business are Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group and Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. We report our Aerospace and Defense Technologies business as one segment. Unallocated Expenses are expenses not associated with a specific business segment. These consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock and bonuses, as well as other general expenses, including corporate administrative expenses.
Energy Services and Products. The primary focus of our Energy Services and Products business over the last several years has been toward instituting operational efficiency programs that leverage our asset base and capabilities for providing services and products predominantly for offshore energy operations and subsea completions, inclusive of our customers' capital and operating budgets. Increasingly, our efforts in our Energy Services business have focused on assisting our customers to reduce their carbon emissions in exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas and in addressing the ongoing energy transition. We are also focusing on opportunities to develop and deploy our capabilities to grow business in offshore wind installations (both fixed and floating) and tidal energy solutions and to utilize our core competencies to provide engineered solutions to the wind, hydrogen and carbon-capture-and-sequestration (“CCS”) markets, as well as expanding our asset integrity management and digital solutions for those markets.
Subsea Robotics. Our Subsea Robotics segment consists of our remotely operated vehicles (“ROVs”), survey services and ROV tooling businesses. We provide ROVs, which are tethered submersible vehicles remotely operated from the surface, to customers in the offshore energy industry for drill support and vessel-based services, including subsea hardware installation, construction, pipeline inspection, survey and facilities inspection, maintenance and repair (“IMR”). We design, build, retrofit and upgrade our new and existing ROVs at in-house facilities, the largest of which is in Morgan City, Louisiana. In 2021, we retired ten of our conventional workclass ROV systems and replaced them with seven upgraded conventional workclass ROV systems and three IsurusTM workclass ROV systems (which are capable of operating in high-current conditions and are ideal for renewables projects and high-speed surveys), which are currently engaged in renewables work. Our work-class ROV fleet size was 250 as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
In 2019, we began deploying our battery-operated Liberty electric ROV (“E-ROV”) system, which we developed in response to a customer’s desire to reduce carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gas“ (“GHG”) emissions associated with its offshore production operations. This system does not require a dedicated vessel to be on standby during ROV operations and reduces the need for ROV and other vessel-based personnel to be transported to and from marine vessels and offshore platforms. We intend to continue to expand our remote service offerings in 
/

this segment given the potentially significant savings in CO₂ emissions available from the Liberty and the IsurusTM systems and other E-ROV systems we are developing.
Manufactured Products. Our Manufactured Products segment provides distribution systems, such as production control umbilicals and connection systems made up of specialty subsea hardware, and provides turnkey solutions that include program management, engineering design, fabrication/assembly and installation to the commercial theme park industry and mobile robotics solutions, including autonomous mobile robots and automated guided vehicles (“AGV”) technology, to a variety of industries.
We provide various types of subsea umbilicals through our Umbilical Solutions division from plants in the United States, Scotland and Brazil. Offshore operators use umbilicals to control subsea wellhead hydrocarbon flow rates, monitor downhole and wellhead conditions and perform chemical injection. Subsea umbilicals are also used to provide power and fluids to other subsea processing hardware, including pumps and gas separation equipment.
Offshore Projects Group. Our Offshore Projects Group (“OPG”) segment provides a broad portfolio of integrated subsea project capabilities and solutions as follows:
•subsea installation and mechanical and hydraulic intervention, including riserless light well intervention (“RLWI”) services and IMR services, utilizing owned and chartered vessels;
•installation and workover control systems (“IWOCS”) and ROV workover control systems (“RWOCS”);
•project management and engineering; and
•drill pipe riser services and systems and wellhead load relief solutions.
Our OPG segment provides services principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola, utilizing a fleet consisting of three owned and three chartered dynamically positioned deepwater vessels with integrated high-specification work-class ROVs onboard, and two owned shallow-water diving support and survey vessel, other spot-chartered vessels and other assets. Our owned vessels are Jones Act-compliant. The dynamically positioned vessels are equipped with thrusters that allow them to maintain a constant position at a location without the use of anchors. They are used in the IMR of subsea facilities, pipeline or flowline tie-ins, pipeline crossings and installations. These vessels can also carry and install equipment or umbilicals required to bring subsea well completions into production (tie-back to production facilities). We have a mix of short-term charters where we can see firm workload and spot charters as market opportunities arise.
In the second quarter of 2019, we placed our new-build, Jones Act-compliant, multiservice vessel (“MSV”), the Ocean Evolution, into service. The Ocean Evolution is U.S.-flagged and documented with a coastwise endorsement by the U.S. Coast Guard. The vessel has an overall length of 353 feet, a Class 2 dynamic positioning system, accommodations for 110 personnel, a helideck, a 250-ton active heave-compensated crane, a working moonpool, and two of our high specification 4,000 meter work-class ROVs. The vessel has five low-emission U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Tier 4 diesel engines. The Tier 4 rating is the EPA’s strictest emission requirements for non-road diesel engines. The vessel is also equipped with a satellite communications system capable of transmitting streaming video for real-time work observation by shore-based personnel. The vessel is being used to provide subsea installation and intervention services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These services are required to perform IMR projects and hardware installations.
Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. Through our Integrity Management & Digital Solutions (“IMDS”) segment, we provide asset integrity management, corrosion management, inspection and non-destructive testing services, principally to customers in the oil and gas, power generation, and petrochemical industries. We perform these services on both onshore and offshore facilities, both topside and subsea. We also provide software, digital and connectivity solution for the energy industry and software and analytical solutions for the bulk cargo maritime industry. 
Aerospace and Defense Technologies. Our Aerospace and Defense Technologies (“ADTech”) segment provides government services and products including engineering and related manufacturing in defense and space exploration activities, principally to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors. Many of the services and products utilized in ADTech are applied technologies based on our core competencies and knowledge derived from decades of working in the offshore markets and solving complex problems in harsh environments.
General. We intend to continue our strategy of acquiring, as opportunities arise, additional assets or businesses, to improve our market position or expand into related service and product lines. Our ability to generate substantial cash flow over the last several years has allowed us to repurchase $100 million of our 4.650% Senior Notes due 
/

2024 (the “2024 Senior Notes”) and shift our focus from the pending maturity to growth where we will continue to develop and deliver technologies to help our customers produce hydrocarbons in a cleaner, safer manner while increasing our investments into new markets including energy transition, digital asset management, aerospace and defense solutions, and mobility solutions.

MARKETING
Energy Services and Products. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures fluctuate from year to year. In particular, budgetary approval for drilling and production in deepwater, an area in which we have a high degree of focus, may be postponed or suspended during periods when exploration and production companies reduce their offshore capital spending. In recent years, we have focused on increasing our service and product offerings toward our oil and gas customers' operating expenses and the offshore renewables energy market.
We market our Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, OPG and IMDS services and products to domestic, international and foreign national oil and gas companies engaged in offshore exploration, development and production. We also provide services and products as a subcontractor to other oilfield service companies operating as prime contractors. In addition, we market our Manufactured Products mobile robotic solutions to domestic and international theme park operators, automotive manufacturers, hospitals and retail warehousing operators. Customers for our energy services and products typically award contracts on a competitive-bid basis. These contracts are typically less than one year in duration, although we enter into multi-year contracts from time to time.
In connection with the services we perform in our Energy Services and Products business, we generally seek contracts that compensate us on a dayrate basis. Under dayrate contracts, the contractor provides the ROV, vessel or equipment and the required personnel to operate the unit and compensation is based on a rate per day for each day the unit is used. The typical dayrate depends on market conditions, the nature of the operations to be performed, the duration of the work, the equipment and services to be provided, the geographical areas involved and other variables. Dayrate contracts may also contain an alternate, lower dayrate that applies when a unit is moving to a new site or when operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the contractor's control. Contracts for our product sales are generally for a fixed price.
Aerospace and Defense Technologies. We market our engineered products and services primarily to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors in defense and space exploration activities. 
Major Customers. Our top five customers in 2021, 2020 and 2019 accounted for 36%, 32% and 32%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, four of our top five customers were oil and gas exploration and production companies served by our Energy Services and Products business segments, with the other one being the U.S. Government, which is served by our Aerospace and Defense Technologies segment. During 2021, revenue from one customer, the U.S. Government, accounted for 12% of our total consolidated annual revenue, and no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during 2020. During 2019, revenue from one customer, BP plc and subsidiaries, accounted for 10% of our total consolidated annual revenue.
Although we do not depend on any one customer, the loss of one of our significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
We purchase various raw materials for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services. The key raw materials we use include steel in various forms, polymers, copper wire, electronic components and plastics. Most of the raw materials that are critical to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources, but may be subject to price volatility. In addition, global market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials, and our procurement personnel are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials. In addition to raw materials, we also use the products and services of a number of other providers, such as forge companies, casting foundries, metal fabricators, machine shops and logistics providers, in order to 
/

produce and deliver products to our customers. Most of these materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.
COMPETITION
Our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments.
Energy Services and Products
We are one of several companies that provide underwater services and specialty subsea hardware on a worldwide basis. We compete for contracts with companies that have worldwide operations, as well as numerous others operating locally in various areas. We believe that our ability to safely provide a wide range of underwater services and products on a worldwide basis enables us to compete effectively in all phases of the offshore oilfield life cycle. In some cases involving projects that require less sophisticated equipment, small companies have been able to bid for contracts at prices uneconomical to us. Additionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete.
The adverse impacts of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the associated supply and demand imbalance for crude oil have resulted in periods of lower levels of activity and profitability. In response, we implemented cost efficiency initiatives. We believe our energy businesses are positioned to benefit from improving global markets for our services and products.
Subsea Robotics. We believe we are the world's largest owner/operator of work-class ROVs employed in energy related operations. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 250 work-class ROVs. We compete with several major companies on a worldwide basis and with numerous others operating locally in various areas. Competition for ROV services, including ROV tooling, historically has been based on equipment availability, location of or ability to deploy the equipment, quality of service and price. The relative importance of these factors can vary over time based on market conditions. The ability to develop improved equipment and techniques and to attract, train and retain skilled personnel is also an important competitive factor in our markets. 
Our survey and positioning services operate in a competitive environment as one of several companies that provide these services. 
Manufactured Products. With our manufactured products business, we are one of several companies that compete on a worldwide basis for the provision of steel tube and thermoplastic control umbilicals, and, compared to current and forecasted market demand, we are faced with some overcapacity in the umbilical manufacturing market. We believe the recent closures or reductions in capacity by some of our competitors should help with balancing a historically over-supplied market.
Within our mobility solutions businesses, there are many competitors offering specialized services and products, both on a regional and a global basis.
Offshore Projects Group. We perform subsea intervention and hardware installation services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola, from multiservice deepwater vessels. We are one of many companies that offer these services. In general, our competitors can move their vessels to where we operate from other locations with relative ease. However, some of our competitors’ vessels are not Jones Act-compliant which requires that vessels operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico be built and 75% U.S. owned in order to transport merchandise between points in the United States. We also have many competitors that supply commercial diving services to the oil and gas industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Within our service and rental business, there are many competitors offering specialized services and products both on a regional and a global basis.
Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. The worldwide asset integrity and inspection markets consist of a wide range of inspection and certification requirements in many industries. We currently compete in only selected portions of this market. We are expanding our integrity management services into adjacent markets and are developing our digitization services. We believe that our broad geographic sales and operational coverage, long history of operations, technical and safety reputation, application of various inspection technologies and accreditation to international quality standards enable us to compete effectively in our selected asset integrity and inspection services market segments. 
/

Aerospace and Defense Technologies
Engineering services is a very broad market with a large number of competitors. We compete in specialized areas in which we can combine our extensive knowledge of operating in harsh environments, program management experience, mechanical engineering expertise and the capability to continue the development of conceptual project designs into the manufacture of custom equipment for customers.
SEASONALITY AND BACKLOG
We generate a material amount of our consolidated revenue from contracts for services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in our OPG segment, which is usually more active in the second and third quarters, as compared to the rest of the year. The European operations of our IMDS segment are also seasonally more active in the second and third quarters. Revenue in our Subsea Robotics segment is subject to seasonal variations in demand, with our first quarter generally being the low quarter of the year. The level of our Subsea Robotics seasonality depends on the number of ROVs we have engaged in vessel-based subsea infrastructure IMR and installation, which is more seasonal than drill support. Revenue in each of our Manufactured Products and ADTech segments generally has not been seasonal.
The amounts of backlog orders we believed to be firm as of 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):
 
 | As of December 31, 2021 | | As of December 31, 2020
 | Total | | 1+ yr (1) | | Total | | 1+ yr (1)

(1) Represents amounts that were not expected to be performed within one year.

No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the U.S. Government.
PATENTS AND LICENSES
We currently hold numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We have acquired patents and licenses and granted licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.
REGULATION
Our operations are affected from time to time and in varying degrees by foreign and domestic political developments and foreign, federal and local laws and regulations, including those relating to:
•operating from and around offshore drilling, production and marine facilities;
•national preference for local equipment and personnel;
•marine vessel safety;
•protection of the environment, including pollution, GHG emissions and climate change;
•workplace health and safety;
•data privacy;
•taxation;
/

•license requirements for exportation of our equipment and technology; and
•currency conversion and repatriation.
In addition, our Energy Services and Products business primarily depends on the demand for our services and products from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic and other policy reasons (such as addressing concerns about climate change) would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
Environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (each, as amended) and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to the above-mentioned federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and waste, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, primarily, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future but anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and costly. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the “safe harbor” protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company. These statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future orders, revenue, income and capital spending. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “forecast,” “budget,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.
/

In addition, various statements this report contains, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention are forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements appear in Part I of this report in Item 1—“Business,” Item 2—“Properties” and Item 3—“Legal Proceedings” and in Part II of this report in Item 7—“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated into Item 8 and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, we disclaim any obligation to update these statements, and we caution you not to rely unduly on them. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following:
•factors affecting the level of activity in the energy industry, including worldwide demand for and prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas production growth and the supply and demand of offshore drilling rigs;
•actions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil exporting countries;
•decisions about offshore developments to be made by oil and gas exploration, development and production companies;
•decisions about offshore developments to be made by offshore renewables companies;
•the use of subsea completions and our ability to capture a share of the associated market;
•factors affecting the level of activity in our government businesses, including decisions on spending and funding by the U.S. Government;
•factors affecting the level of activity in our entertainment businesses, including decisions on capital expenditure decisions by entertainment business customers, such as theme park operators;
•general economic and business conditions and industry trends, including the ongoing transition to alternative sources of energy to reduce worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” and the effects of inflation;
•the strength of the industry segments in which we are involved;
•the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental, customer, supplier and other responses to the pandemic;
•cancellations of contracts, change orders and other contractual modifications and the resulting adjustments to our backlog;
•collections from our customers;
•the availability and increased costs of chartered vessels;
•our future financial performance, including as a result of the availability, terms and deployment of capital;
•the consequences of significant changes in currency exchange rates;
•the volatility and uncertainties of credit markets;
•our ability to comply with covenants in our credit agreements and other debt instruments and the availability, terms and deployment of capital; 
•changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretation by taxing authorities;
•changes in, or our ability to comply with, other laws and governmental regulations, including those relating to the environment (including pollution and climate change);
•the continued availability of qualified personnel and our ability to attract and retain those qualified personnel;
•our ability to obtain raw materials and parts on a timely basis and, in some cases, from limited sources;
•increases in material costs on long-term projects at prices higher than originally forecast;
•operating risks normally incident to offshore exploration, development and production operations;
•hurricanes and other adverse weather and sea conditions;
•cost and time associated with drydocking of our vessels;
•the highly competitive nature of our businesses;
•adverse outcomes from legal or regulatory proceedings;
/

•the risks associated with integrating businesses we acquire;
•the risks associated with the transition to a more remote workforce;
•the risks associated with the use of complex information technology systems, including cybersecurity risks and the risks associated with failures to protect data privacy in accordance with applicable legal requirements and contractual provisions binding upon us;
•rapid technological changes; and
•social, political, military and economic situations in foreign countries where we do business and the possibilities of civil disturbances, war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks.
We believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have discussed most of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that important factors we do not refer to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
