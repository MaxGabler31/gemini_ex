Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative and minimally invasive neuromodulation solutions for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Our proprietary platform technology, Barostim, is designed to leverage the power of the brain to address the imbalance of the Autonomic Nervous System (“ANS”), which causes heart failure (“HF”) and other cardiovascular diseases. Our second-generation product, Barostim, is the first and only commercially available neuromodulation device indicated to improve symptoms for patients with HF with reduced Ejection Fraction (“HFrEF”), or systolic HF. Barostim provides Baroreflex Activation Therapy (“BAT,” or “Barostim Therapy”) by sending imperceptible and persistent electrical pulses to baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery to signal the brain to modulate the cardiovascular function. We have developed a significant body of published clinical evidence that supports the strong value proposition of Barostim Therapy and its ability to meaningfully improve the quality of life for patients suffering from HFrEF. We estimate that our initial annual market opportunity for HFrEF is $1.4 billion in the U.S. and $1.5 billion in select European Markets (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, or “EU5”).
​
HF is one of the most prevalent and devastating cardiovascular diseases. We estimate that there are approximately 26 million people globally suffering from HF, including approximately 6.2 million people in the U.S. and 8.6 million people in EU5. Every year, 1.3 million and 1.4 million new patients are diagnosed with HF in the U.S. and select EU5, respectively. HF is characterized by the heart’s inability to effectively circulate blood throughout the body resulting in insufficient levels of oxygen and nourishment to various body parts. This impacts a patient’s ability to function and leads to a variety of symptoms such as shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, exercise intolerance, swelling and fluid retention that affects the patient’s quality of life, both physically and emotionally. HF usually develops from an imbalance of the ANS, which is also the primary cause of multiple other cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, angina pectoris and arrhythmia. The ANS plays a vital role in the function of the heart and is strongly influenced by baroreceptors located in certain arterial walls.
​
We are currently focused on the treatment of patients with HFrEF, which represents approximately 40% of the patients with HF. In HFrEF, the left ventricle loses its ability to contract properly, resulting in insufficient power to pump and push the necessary quantities of blood into circulation. Approximately 75% of HFrEF patients die within five years of being admitted to the hospital for HFrEF. Patients with HFrEF are typically placed on a treatment progression plan during which they are initially given Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (“GDMT”) to help manage symptoms, and then progress to more invasive and costly treatment options involving other implantable devices with the most severe patients often requiring Left Ventricular Assist Devices (“LVADs”) or heart transplants. These other implantable devices mostly target different HFrEF patient populations, may require an invasive procedure that places hardware directly inside the heart, and are not designed to address the imbalance of the ANS that causes the disease. We believe there is a significant need and market opportunity for a safe, effective and minimally invasive device-based treatment option for HFrEF.
​
We believe Barostim offers meaningful benefits for patients, physicians and payors that will continue to drive adoption of our therapy. The primary benefits include:
​

• | Addresses significant unmet medical need. Barostim addresses a life-threatening disease for patients who failed to receive adequate benefits from existing treatments and who have no alternative treatment options. Based on this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) granted Barostim a Breakthrough Device designation for HFrEF in June 2015.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safe and effective treatment. Our BeAT-HF pivotal trial demonstrated compelling safety and effectiveness data regarding the clinical benefits of Barostim for HFrEF. These results showed significant improvement in the following patient-centered outcomes:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Quality of life (measured by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (“MLWHF”)): Our therapy demonstrated a 14-point improvement in quality of life for patients in the device arm relative to patients in the control arm. A 5-point improvement is considered clinically meaningful.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exercise capacity (measured by the standardized 6 Minute Hall Walk (“6MHW”) distance test): Our therapy demonstrated that patients in the device arm were able to improve the distance they walked in a six-minute period by 60 meters more than patients in the control arm. A 25-meter improvement in walking distance is considered clinically meaningful.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Functional status (determined by New York Heart Association (“NYHA”) classification): Our therapy demonstrated that 65% of patients in the device arm improved at least one NYHA class as compared to only 31% in the control arm, with 13% of patients improving two NYHA classes in the device arm as compared to only 2% in the control arm.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Widely accepted mechanism of action. Our platform technology is based on a widely accepted mechanism of action and is designed to address the imbalance of the ANS, which causes HFrEF and other cardiovascular diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong global clinical evidence. The benefits of treatment with Barostim were shown to be similarly robust and reproducible across all three of our HF clinical studies, including BAT-in-HF (Phase I), HOPE4HF (Phase II) and BeAT-HF (Phase III pivotal trial), evaluating 624 patients in aggregate across the U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Canada and the United Kingdom. Barostim Therapy’s trial results have been published in more than 60 peer-reviewed publications, approximately 20 of which relate to the treatment of HF, including, among others, the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimally invasive implant procedure. Barostim’s implantable pulse generator (“IPG”) and stimulation lead are implanted during a minimally invasive procedure typically performed in an outpatient setting that lasts approximately one hour and involves two small skin incisions. Our device does not require hardware to be implanted in the heart or vasculature, which is the case with most other device-based treatments indicated for different HFrEF patient populations. Patients typically recover quickly and are discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of the procedure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential reduction in total healthcare costs for HFrEF patients. A Company-sponsored and co-authored cost-impact analysis, which was published in BMC Cardiovascular Disorders, a peer-reviewed manuscript, predicted that BAT plus GDMT would become the lower-cost alternative treatment within three years from implantation, as compared to GDMT alone, resulting in significant cost savings to healthcare systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inherent patient compliance and durability. Barostim ensures patient compliance, unlike most commercially available drug treatments, as it requires no device interaction by the patient. Our device has a battery that does not require recharging, has an average service life of five years and is replaced through a short outpatient procedure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barostim is a minimally invasive neuromodulation device that consists of two implantable components, an IPG and a stimulation lead and is programmed by a wireless clinician-controlled programmer that communicates with the IPG. The IPG contains the electronics and battery in a hermetic enclosure and controls and delivers the imperceptible and persistent electrical pulses to the carotid baroreceptors through the stimulation lead attached to the exterior wall of the carotid artery. These electrical pulses delivered to the baroreceptors increase signals to the brain to modulate the cardiovascular function, thereby improving symptoms of HFrEF. Our wireless programmer allows physicians to verify and customize the therapy to the patient’s needs by adjusting the intensity and frequency of the electrical pulses.
​
We have developed a significant clinical data set that demonstrates the safety, effectiveness, patient adherence and durable benefits of Barostim Therapy. Our BeAT-HF pivotal trial, which was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, met the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints and 

6



demonstrated meaningful improvement in the quality of life, both physically and emotionally, for patients suffering from HFrEF. These results led to FDA Premarket Approval (“PMA”) approval of Barostim in August 2019 on an accelerated basis of only four months from the submission of the clinical trial report. We continue to develop and expand upon our significant body of published clinical evidence that supports the meaningful benefits of Barostim Therapy. We have also established a U.S. patient registry to evaluate and assess real world outcomes from HFrEF patients who have been implanted with Barostim.
​
We primarily sell Barostim to hospitals through a direct sales organization in the U.S. and Germany and through distributors in Austria, Spain, Italy, the Nordic region and other European countries. Our global sales and marketing team engages in sales efforts and promotional activities focused on electrophysiologists (“EPs”), HF specialists, general cardiologists and vascular surgeons. We are prioritizing our sales and marketing efforts on high volume EP centers that are strategically located and on building long-standing relationships with key physicians. We support these physicians through all aspects of the patient journey, which includes initial diagnosis, surgical support and patient follow-up. We also highlight our compelling clinical benefits and value proposition to build awareness and adoption among physicians through targeted key opinion leader (“KOL”) development, referral network education and direct-to-consumer marketing. We utilize direct communication channels to inform and educate patients about Barostim Therapy and utilize a qualification process to aid in the identification of the appropriate patients for our therapy. In the U.S., Barostim is fully reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) across all regions. We offer assistance to patients and providers with reimbursement approvals, if required. We plan to continue actively expanding our direct sales force and commercial organization in the U.S., which is where we expect to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts in the near-term.
​
The primary focus of our research and development efforts in the near-term will be the continued technological advancement of Barostim, including tools to simplify the implant procedure for physicians. In 2022, we expect to launch an enhanced IPG that will be approximately 10% smaller in size and improve the battery life by approximately 20% to an average of six years. We are also developing a new implant toolkit called BATwire, which enables an ultrasound-guided implant procedure to implant Barostim and the use of local anesthetics, potentially expanding our annual market opportunity in the U.S. In the future, we plan to explore Barostim’s potential to expand its indications for use to other cardiovascular diseases, including different forms of HF, hypertension and arrhythmias. Expansions into these or other new indications would require additional FDA approvals and may involve additional clinical trials or modifications to Barostim to treat such indications. If clinical studies for future indications do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the U.S. or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize our products for these indications.
​
We generated revenue of $13.0 million, a gross margin of 72% and a net loss of $43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to revenue of $6.1 million, a gross margin of 76% and a net loss of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue for 2020 and 2021 was negatively impacted due to the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. Specifically, in March 2020, healthcare facilities and clinics began restricting in-person access to their clinicians, reducing patient consultations and treatments or temporarily closing their facilities. As a result, beginning in the second week of March 2020, substantially all of our then-scheduled procedures were postponed, and numerous other cases could not be scheduled. During May 2020, the widespread shutdown resulted in key physician-society conferences being moved to a virtual setting, which directly impacted the commercial launch in the U.S. By the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020, implant centers had resumed procedures in the U.S. and Europe. Procedure volumes were negatively impacted by the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $394.8 million and $351.7 million, respectively.
​
Our success factors
We are focused on transforming the lives of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases by developing, manufacturing, and commercializing innovative and minimally invasive neuromodulation solutions, which we believe offer a compelling value proposition for large and significantly underpenetrated markets. We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:

​

• | Novel solution offering meaningful clinical benefits to an underserved patient population suffering from HFrEF. Barostim is the first and only commercially available neuromodulation device indicated to improve symptoms for HFrEF patients who currently have no viable device-based treatment alternatives. Barostim has demonstrated clinically meaningful symptomatic improvement across industry-standard HF patient-centered outcomes. Our therapy works by sending persistent and imperceptible electrical pulses to baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery, which increases signals to the brain to modulate the cardiovascular function, thereby improving symptoms of HFrEF. Barostim’s IPG and stimulation lead are implanted and sutured subcutaneously during a one-hour, minimally invasive procedure with no hardware implanted in the heart or vasculature. Additionally, once implanted, Barostim has an average service life of five years and an implantable battery that does not require recharging. Barostim ensures patient compliance, unlike most commercially available drug treatments, as it requires no device interaction by the patient. With these features, we believe the revolutionary Barostim has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for many of the 26 million people worldwide with HFrEF, representing an initial annual market opportunity of $2.9 billion.

• | Significant body of clinical evidence targeting a widely accepted mechanism of action. The benefits of treatment with Barostim were similarly robust and reproducible across our three HFrEF clinical studies, including BAT-in-HF (Phase I), HOPE4HF (Phase II) and BeAT-HF (Phase III pivotal trial), evaluating 624 patients in aggregate across the U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Canada and the United Kingdom. Our HOPE4HF clinical trial results led to CE Mark approval and FDA Breakthrough Device designation for HFrEF, and our BeAT-HF pivotal trial results led to FDA approval on an accelerated basis of only four months from the submission of the clinical trial report. Our trial results have been published in more than 60 peer-reviewed publications, approximately 20 of which relate to the treatment of HF, including, among others, the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The BeAT-HF pivotal trial, which was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, met its primary endpoints and the positive safety and effectiveness data exceeded the pre-specified performance criteria across multiple dimensions, which measure the improvement in the quality of the patients’ daily lives. Importantly, the significant benefits of our therapy were observed despite a four-fold uptake of ARNI in the control arm, as compared to the device arm.

• | Favorable reimbursement paradigm for both outpatient and inpatient settings. Barostim is currently indicated for HFrEF patients, 67% of whom are above the age of 65, and therefore are eligible for Medicare or Medicare Advantage. In the U.S., Barostim is reimbursed for outpatient and inpatient procedures by the CMS, with established coverage policies and Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) payment codes. Barostim Therapy is eligible for payment across all seven local Medicare administrative contractor (“MAC”) regions, representing 38 million covered lives as of July 2020. Of note, CMS awarded Barostim Transitional Pass-Through (“TPT”) payment for outpatient procedures that adds the device cost as a pass-through to the calculated procedure cost in the payment code, which took effect in January 2021. In addition, CMS awarded Barostim a New Technology Add-on Payment (“NTAP”) for inpatient procedures in the amount of 65% of the device cost that is incremental to reimbursement provided for the implant procedure, which took effect in October 2020. As part of our ongoing reimbursement strategy to broaden payor coverage, we are currently building a dedicated market access team to help patients and providers work with private payors to secure the appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of initial treatment, which we believe will drive additional positive coverage outcomes for up to approximately 20% of our target-indicated patient population.

• | Targeted and methodical approach to market development in the U.S. We have established a systematic approach to market development that centers on active engagement with physicians and patients. Our direct sales organization is focused on prioritizing high volume EP centers that are strategically located and on building long-standing relationships with key physicians. We support these physicians through all aspects of the patient journey, which includes initial patient diagnosis, surgical support and patient follow-up. Due to the lack of commercially available device-based treatments for our target-indicated patient population, our sales force is keenly focused on increasing awareness by educating referral physicians on the compelling clinical results and strong value proposition of Barostim Therapy. We

• | Platform technology protected by a comprehensive and broad IP portfolio. We developed an integrated platform technology, Barostim, which is designed to leverage the power of the brain and nervous system to address the primary cause of HF and other cardiovascular diseases. Barostim is our second-generation HFrEF product, which is FDA approved and CE Marked, providing access to an initial estimated annual market opportunity of $2.9 billion in the U.S. and EU5. While we are currently focused on the treatment of HFrEF patients with limited viable device-based treatment alternatives, we believe our platform technology has the potential to provide benefits to a broader set of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Our platform technology is supported by our comprehensive portfolio of wholly owned intellectual property, which includes patents, know-how and trade secrets, including therapy regimens, IPGs, leads and electrodes, delivery tools and implant methods. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 54 issued U.S. patents and had three pending U.S. patent applications. Outside of the U.S., we owned seven patents in multiple countries and had one pending application. Our trademark portfolio contains nine trademarks in the U.S. and multiple other countries.

Our growth drivers
Our mission is to capitalize upon our first mover advantage to become the global leader in providing clinically proven, innovative and minimally invasive neuromodulation solutions that improve the health of patients with HFrEF and other cardiovascular diseases. Our strategic levers to drive continued growth are as follows:
​

• | Continue to build a commercialization infrastructure with a specialized direct sales and marketing team in the U.S. We have grown our commercial team in the U.S. to include a direct sales force with substantial applicable medical device sales and clinical experience. Similarly, our marketing team has a significant amount of domain expertise and a strong track record of success. Our Account Managers, along with the support from our Clinical Field Specialists, are responsible for establishing, growing and supporting implant centers and referral physicians. We plan to expand our commercial organization in the U.S. by adding a strategic mix of highly qualified Account Managers and Clinical Field Specialists. Our direct sales force will leverage our existing network of EPs to maximize early commercial traction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promote awareness among payors, physicians and patients to accelerate adoption of Barostim. We believe Barostim has the potential to become the standard of care for our target-indicated patient population, which currently lacks commercially available device-based treatment options. The vast majority of our indicated patients are well-defined under the purview of an EP and may have already been pre-indicated for an implantable cardiac defibrillator (“ICD”). As a result, we believe that raising awareness among EPs of Barostim Therapy and its clinical benefits will be an effective strategy to accelerate market adoption. We intend to continue to increase engagement with key stakeholders in the decision-making process, including EPs, HF specialists, general cardiologists, vascular surgeons, referring primary care physicians and patients with HF, as well as hospital administrators and third-party payors. In addition, we plan to continue to educate and train physicians as well as continue to publish additional clinical data in peer reviewed publications, online and at various industry conferences. We also plan to continue promoting

patient awareness through our direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives, which includes social media advertising, patient webinars and online videos. We believe this market development strategy will further support adoption of Barostim.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand upon our significant body of clinical evidence. We will continue to develop and expand upon our growing body of published clinical evidence that endorses the strong value proposition of Barostim Therapy. We also plan to continue enrollment of the U.S. patient registry to evaluate and assess real world patient outcomes, as well as publish additional long-term data to further increase awareness and adoption of Barostim and for inclusion in the medical guidelines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue innovation of Barostim to enhance our value proposition. We are committed to driving continuous innovation and technological advancement of Barostim, specifically around simplifying the implant procedure and use of our therapy. For example, we are currently developing a new implant toolkit called BATwire, which enables an ultrasound-guided procedure to implant Barostim and the use of local anesthetics, potentially expanding our addressable patient population to include those who are deemed clinically unfit for the current procedure. In addition, as a result of this simplified implantation process, we believe more physicians, including EPs, would be confident and comfortable implanting Barostim. In 2022, we also expect to launch an enhanced IPG in the U.S. that will be approximately 10% smaller in size and improve the battery life by approximately 20% to an average of six years. We believe our product roadmap coupled with a more simplified procedural process would improve clinical outcomes, optimize patient adoption and comfort, increase access of Barostim to a greater number of patients and allow more physicians to perform the procedure.

• | Leverage our platform technology to expand into new indications and strategically pursue new international markets. HF is a prevalent, devastating and costly condition that affects over 26 million people worldwide. While we are currently focused on the treatment of HFrEF patients, we believe our technology has the potential to provide benefits to a broader set of patients suffering from other cardiovascular diseases. Through additional investment in clinical research and development, our goal is to explore Barostim’s potential to expand the indications for use to other areas, while continuing to increase its market adoption and implantation in indicated patients with HFrEF. In addition, we are pursuing a morbidity and mortality indication in HF which would expand our addressable patient population. While our primary commercial focus in the near-term is on the large opportunity within the U.S., we plan to selectively expand our commercial and regulatory efforts in international markets.

Our market and industry
Overview of HF
HF is one of the most prevalent and devastating cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that HF currently affects approximately 26 million people globally, including approximately 6.2 million people in the U.S. and approximately 8.6 million people in the EU5. Every year, 1.3 million and 1.4 million new patients are diagnosed with HF in the U.S. and the EU5, respectively. HF is associated with a five-fold increase in sudden cardiac death. Despite currently available pharmaceutical and device-based treatments, projections by the American Heart Association’s (“AHA”) 2020 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics show that the prevalence of HF is expected to increase approximately 46% from 2012 to 2030 in the U.S. alone due to an aging population and health issues related to diabetes and obesity. There is no known prevention for HF other than the treatment of the common risk factors associated with the disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.
​
HF is a debilitating, progressive and potentially life-threatening condition where the heart does not pump enough blood throughout the body. Without proper blood circulation, insufficient levels of oxygen and nourishment are delivered to various body parts, impacting a person’s ability to function and leading to a variety of symptoms that affect quality of life, both physically and emotionally, such as shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, exercise intolerance, swelling and fluid retention. HF usually develops as a result of an 

10



imbalance of the ANS, which is also the primary cause of multiple other cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, angina pectoris and arrhythmia.
​
The role of the imbalance of ANS in HF
The ANS, which is a part of the peripheral nervous system, plays a vital role in the function of the heart. It is a collection of receptors and neurons that acts outside of a person’s conscious awareness, regulating bodily functions such as bodily fluid production, urination and sexual responses. There are two primary components of the ANS that impact heart functionality: the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system.
​
The sympathetic system of the ANS is responsible for preparing the body for action through the “fight or flight” response. When the body perceives a threat in the environment, the sympathetic system reacts by increasing the heart rate, widening the airways to allow for easier breathing, releasing stored energy, increasing strength in the muscles and slowing digestion and other bodily processes that are not as critical for taking action. These changes prepare the body to respond appropriately to a threat in its environment.
​
The parasympathetic system of the ANS is responsible for restoring the body to a state of calm through the “rest and digest” counter response in order to maintain homeostasis. This is done by decreasing the heart rate, conserving energy, constricting the airways, relaxing the muscles and increasing digestion.
​
​
These two systems are strongly influenced by baroreceptors that are located in certain arterial walls. The baroreceptors regulate the baroreflex, which is one of the body’s homeostatic mechanisms that help to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. Baroreceptors provide beat-by-beat regulation of the body’s circulatory system by sending electrical signals to the brain.
​
Healthy individuals have balanced sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, promoting the effective function of the heart. However, there are many factors, including a person’s diet, lifestyle and underlying conditions such as diabetes and obesity that can cause an imbalance of the ANS. This imbalance, or the elevated levels of sympathetic activity and reduced levels of parasympathetic activity, may result in additional stress on the heart, leading to HF and potentially death.
​
Overview of HFrEF
When the heart pumps, oxygen-rich blood travels from the lungs, through the left atrium and into the left ventricle from where it is pumped to the rest of the body. Given that the left ventricle is responsible for the majority of the heart’s pumping power, it is larger than the other chambers and critical for proper heart functionality. In left-sided or left-ventricular HF, the left side of the heart must work much harder to pump the same of amount of blood it would under healthy conditions.
​
There are two types of left-sided HF, HFrEF, or systolic heart failure, and HF with preserved Ejection Fraction (“HFpEF”), or diastolic heart failure. In HFrEF, the left ventricle loses its ability to contract properly, resulting in insufficient power to pump and push the necessary quantities of blood into circulation. In HFpEF, the left 

11



ventricle loses its ability to relax properly (due to muscle stiffness), leading to the improper filling of blood in the heart during the resting period between heartbeats.

​
We are currently focused on the treatment of patients with HFrEF, which represents approximately 40% of the patients with HF. These patients currently have limited commercially available device-based treatment options that improve HFrEF symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, swelling of the legs and feet, reduced ability to exercise, a persistent cough, an increased need to urinate and sudden weight gain. Approximately 75% of HFrEF patients die within five years of being admitted to the hospital for HFrEF.
​
Given HFrEF is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease, physicians use a variety of indicators in the underlying pathology, severity of symptoms and a patient’s functional limitations to classify HF patients. Below are some of the common indicators used by cardiologists to diagnose HF:
​

• | NYHA classification: The NYHA classification guidelines are the most common measure of HF severity and allow physicians to classify patients into four groups based on observed symptoms and functional limitations. The least severe functional status is NYHA Class I (mild) with the most advanced being NYHA Class IV (critical). The majority of patients are initially identified as NYHA Class I or II and typically progress into subsequently worse states of the disease despite current treatment options. On average, patients who progress to a NYHA Class III either worsen to Class IV or die after 3.3 years. HFrEF patients are typically classified as NYHA Class II (moderate) or Class III (severe).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level of N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (“NT-proBNP”): NT-proBNP, a non-active prohormone in the heart, is released due to pressure changes inside the heart. NT-proBNP is considered to be at a normal level when it is < 125pg/ml for patients 0–74 years old and < 450pg/ml for patients 75–99 years old. Generally, patients with HF have elevated NT-proBNP levels, with those > 1600pg/ml associated with an extremely poor prognosis and low responses to treatments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Left ventricular ejection fraction (“LVEF”): LVEF is a widely utilized indicator of systolic heart function, or the heart’s ability to pump blood throughout the body. It measures the percentage of blood that is ejected from the left ventricle with each beat. A LVEF < 50% is considered dysfunctional and indicative of HFrEF.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Co-morbidities / clinical fit: A patient’s co-morbidities, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney disease or carotid stenosis, as well as a patient’s physical and psychological fit contribute to a physician’s treatment recommendation given the use of general anesthesia in most HF-related device-based treatment options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | QRS complex: The QRS complex is a classification of ventricle depolarization, or the heart’s ability to open once contracted. It measures the way in which electrical signals travel through the heart and considers the mechanics and duration of the ventricle depolarization. A narrow QRS complex, or a QRS < 120 milliseconds, is usually driven by a right bundle branch block, which is a blockage along the pathway that electrical pulses travel through to the right ventricle in order to generate a heartbeat. A wide QRS complex, or a QRS ≥ 150 milliseconds, is usually driven by a left bundle branch block, which is a blockage impacting the pathway to the left ventricle.

Existing treatments for HFrEF
Patients with HFrEF are typically placed on a treatment progression plan during which they are initially given GDMT to help manage symptoms. GDMT usually includes a progression or combination of prescribed drugs such as Diuretics, Beta-blockers, ACE Inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, SGLT2 Inhibitors and Sinus Node Inhibitors. After being treated with pharmaceuticals for a short period, if the symptoms persist, patients move to more invasive and costly treatment options involving other implantable devices, with the most severe patients often requiring LVADs or heart transplants.
​
Other commercially available implantable devices
Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators (ICD)
​
ICDs are indicated for patients with NYHA Class II or III and LVEF ≤ 35% for both wide and narrow QRS. However, these devices are generally used to prevent sudden cardiac arrest rather than reduce HFrEF symptoms as their electrical shocks focus on restoring a normal heartbeat when a heart beats too quickly or randomly. Given their purpose and mechanism of action, these devices are not a treatment for HFrEF but are used in conjunction with other treatment options that focus on reducing HF symptoms.
​
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (“CRT”)
​
CRTs, or biventricular pacing, are indicated for patients with NYHA Class II or III, LVEF ≤ 35% and wide QRS. These devices are primarily used to reduce symptoms of HFrEF by generating electrical pulses to regulate the pace of a heartbeat. While CRTs can alleviate symptoms for patients with a wide QRS, they are not eligible for patients with a narrow QRS, which represents approximately 59% of patients with NYHA Class II or III and LVEF ≤ 35%. These devices can be combined with an ICD, which are referred to as CRT-D.
​
Cardiac Contractility Modulation (“CCM”)
​
CCM is eligible for patients with a NYHA Class III, LVEF 25%–45%, narrow QRS and normal sinus rhythm. CCM requires an invasive procedure whereby an IPG is implanted under the skin of the upper chest with electrical leads running through the veins and attached inside the heart’s ventricles, sending electrical pulses to the heart after it contracts. The device is rechargeable and therefore requires patients to recharge the battery on a regular basis.
​
Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)
​
LVAD is an irreversible, invasive surgery generally reserved for critical HFrEF patients with NYHA Class IV. An LVAD is a mechanical pump that is implanted inside a patient’s chest and helps pump blood throughout the body. While LVADs do not replace the heart, they do require open chest surgery and often result in the destruction of a portion of the heart. Patients who do not respond to LVADs usually have no other treatment options and become candidates for heart transplants.
​
Despite currently available pharmaceutical and device-based treatments, HF remains underpenetrated and imposes significant direct and indirect costs on the healthcare system through patient care, morbidity, unpaid 

13



care costs, premature mortality and lost productivity. We estimate there are approximately 800,000 HF hospitalizations every year in the U.S., representing approximately $39.5 billion in annual spending.
​
Barostim’s market opportunity
We estimate that our initial annual market opportunity for HFrEF is $2.9 billion. This includes a $1.4 billion initial market opportunity based on approximately 55,000 new HFrEF patients in the U.S., and a $1.5 billion initial market opportunity based on approximately 61,000 new HFrEF patients in EU5. The graphic below indicates what we believe would be the stratification of our annual addressable patient population in the U.S. based on our indication for use and excludes patients who are clinically or psychologically unfit or who have severe comorbidities:
​
​
The annual market opportunity for Barostim is based on the following HF classifications:
​

• | NYHA Class III or II (with recent history of III): Barostim provides symptomatic relief for patients with NYHA Class III or II (with recent history of III), or patients who generally have limits on basic daily activities but are comfortable when resting. We estimate this represents approximately 722,000 of the 1.3 million annual new HF patients in the U.S.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NT-proBNP < 1600pg/ml when stable: Barostim targets patients who have NT-proBNP < 1600pg/ml, which represents approximately 470,000 of the 722,000 of NYHA Class III or II (with recent history of III) annual HF patients in the U.S.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%: Barostim targets patients with a LVEF ≤ 35%, which we estimate represents approximately 182,000 of the 470,000 annual HF patients with NT-proBNP < 1600pg/ml in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinically fit: Barostim is not indicated for HFrEF patients with certain contra-indications, including carotid atherosclerosis and ulcerative plaques, among others. Physicians often exclude patients who are not deemed clinically fit to undergo Barostim procedure. We estimate this represents approximately 94,000 of the 182,000 annual HFrEF patients with LVEF ≤ 35% in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Not indicated for CRT: Barostim targets patients who are not indicated for CRT, particularly patients with QRS < 120ms. We estimate this represents approximately 55,000 of the 94,000 annual HFrEF patients in the U.S. who are clinically fit. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations of other commercially available device-based option for indicated HFrEF patients
There is only one other commercially available device-based option, Cardiac Contractility Modulation (CCM), that targets a subset of the same HFrEF patient population indicated for Barostim. CCM is offered by a single privately-held medical technology company and while it has the potential to improve a patient’s quality of life and reduce symptoms of HFrEF, it is not designed to address the imbalance of the ANS. We believe CCM is associated with the following drawbacks that have resulted in a remaining significant unmet need for a safe, effective and minimally invasive device-based treatment option for HFrEF patients:
​

• | Limited overlap in target patient population: CCM is indicated for a limited population of HF patients with a NYHA Class III, LVEF 25%–45%, narrow QRS and normal sinus rhythm. Within this population, a subset of patients indicated for Barostim are also eligible for CCM, namely those with NYHA Class III and LVEF 25%–35%. As a result, Barostim is the only FDA approved device indicated to improve symptoms for HFrEF patients with NYHA Class III and LVEF <25%, as well as with NYHA Class II (with a recent history of Class III) and LVEF ≤35%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Limited clinical effectiveness in patients with LVEF 25–35%: Based on published clinical data, CCM demonstrated lower effectiveness in the patients with LVEF 25–35% as compared to the patients with LVEF 35–45% across all three evaluated areas: exercise capacity, quality of life and functional status. Patients with LVEF 25–35% who were implanted with CCM walked only 10 additional meters in six minutes and improved the patients’ quality of life by only nine points as compared to the control arm. Furthermore, only 25% of these patients showed an improvement in functional status.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

15



​

• | Invasive procedure: CCM requires an invasive procedure that places hardware directly inside the heart, which increases risks to patients. This approach involves a pacemaker-type device to be placed under the skin of the upper chest with two to three electrical leads running through the veins and attached to the heart’s ventricle.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requires patient compliance: CCM devices require patients to charge the battery inside the IPG as often as once per week, which may result in a lack of patient compliance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our solution
We developed our Barostim platform technology to transform the treatment of HFrEF and other cardiovascular diseases and become the standard of care for this vulnerable and underpenetrated patient population. We believe Barostim offers meaningful benefits for patients, physicians and payors that will continue to drive adoption of our therapy.

Overview of Barostim Therapy
Our integrated platform technology, Barostim, leverages the power of the brain and nervous system to address the primary cause of HFrEF and other cardiovascular diseases. Our product, Barostim, is the first and only commercially available neuromodulation device indicated to improve symptoms for patients with HFrEF. Barostim Therapy utilizes a widely accepted mechanism of action and works by sending imperceptible and persistent electrical pulses to baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery to signal the brain to decrease sympathetic activity and increase parasympathetic activity. This integrated response to rebalancing the ANS is well understood to normalize blood pressure, improve remodeling of the heart, increase vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and improve kidney function. Based on the results of our BeAT-HF pivotal trial, Barostim has demonstrated its ability to meaningfully improve the quality of daily life, both physically and emotionally, for patients suffering from HFrEF.
​
Barostim
Barostim consists of two implantable components: an IPG and a stimulation lead. The image below depicts the relative location and size of Barostim under the patient’s skin:

16



​
Implantable pulse generator
​
The current IPG contains the electronics and battery in a hermetic enclosure, has an average service life of five years and includes a battery that does not require any recharging. The IPG provides control and delivery of electrical pulses to baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery through the stimulation lead. Nominal dimensions for the current IPG are listed in the figure below:
​
​
Stimulation lead
​
The stimulation lead is attached via six suture points to the exterior wall of the carotid artery and is connected to the current IPG. This allows the stimulation lead to carry the electrical pulses from the IPG to the baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery. The stimulation lead terminates with a two-millimeter electrode. There are two lengths of the stimulation lead available to allow for anatomical variations to be used at the physician’s discretion.
​

17



​
Ancillary surgical accessories
​
In addition to the IPG and stimulation lead, we provide physicians with single-use surgical tools, including the port plug, torque wrench, implant tool and implant adaptor, all of which were designed to facilitate the implantation of Barostim.
​
Programmer
​
Once implanted, Barostim is managed wirelessly by a programmer that communicates with the IPG. The programmer can be used to assist in verifying the desired location of the stimulation electrode during the implant procedure and allows physicians to input their patient’s therapy parameters and retrieve information on the status of the IPG, including the remaining battery life, without touching the IPG or the patient.
​
​
Treating patients with Barostim
Patient selection
​
Barostim is indicated for the improvement of symptoms of HFrEF — quality of life, 6MHW and functional status — for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with GDMT, are NYHA Class III or II (who had a recent history of Class III), have a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%, a NT-proBNP < 1600 pg/ml and are not indicated for CRT according to the AHA/American College of Cardiology (“ACC”)/European Society of Cardiology (“ESC”) guidelines.
​
Once a patient is diagnosed with HFrEF and recommended for an ICD and/or CRT, general cardiologists will usually refer them to EPs. EPs will often conduct a series of diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram, ultrasound and various blood tests, from which they will determine the patient’s eligibility for our therapy. The vast majority of our indicated patients are well-defined under the purview of an EP and may have already been pre-indicated for an ICD, whether or not they chose to undergo the ICD implantation procedure.
​

18



Implantation
​
Barostim is implanted during a short, minimally invasive procedure that is typically performed on an outpatient basis by a vascular surgeon and possibly an EP. The procedure has two steps. During the first step, a small incision is made on the right side of the neck to expose the carotid sinus. The physician uses the implant tool to hold the lead electrode in contact with the outside wall of the carotid artery while the lead is temporarily connected to the IPG to verify the location of the electrode. After the electrode is sutured in place, the second step begins by making a small incision below the right clavicle where a pocket is created under the skin to hold the IPG. The main body of the stimulation lead is tunneled under the skin, but over the clavicle, from the neck to the pocket. The lead connector is inserted and secured into the IPG header. Lastly, the IPG is placed in the pocket and a few stiches are used to close each incision.
​
This implantation procedure, which typically lasts one hour, is usually performed under general anesthesia and may require a short hospital stay. While patients may experience mild discomfort and swelling at the incision sites for a few days, this often can be managed with over-the-counter pain medications. Patients typically recover quickly and are discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of the procedure.
​
Activation/Titration
​
After Barostim is implanted and activated, the patient attends a few follow-up visits with their doctor, during which the device is progressively titrated from a moderate level to a higher amplitude of electrical stimulation. The primary objective of these follow-up visits is for the patient to reach the optimal level of stimulation, which is typically achieved approximately three months after implantation. The exact level of stimulation varies from patient to patient based on the response to Barostim Therapy. Barostim can be adjusted through a digital wireless programmer, allowing the clinician to monitor and customize the therapy to the patient’s needs by adjusting the intensity and frequency of the electrical pulses being sent to the carotid artery. After the titration period, it is recommended that the patient attend a clinical visit two times each year to check impedance, battery longevity and adequacy of programming.
​
Key benefits for patients, physicians and payors
Barostim is designed to advance patient care and provide a safe, effective and economically attractive treatment option to an underserved patient population suffering from HFrEF. We believe the following factors offer meaningful benefits for patients, physicians and payors that will continue to drive broad adoption of our therapy:
​

• | Addresses significant unmet medical need. Barostim addresses a life-threatening disease for patients who failed to receive adequate benefits from existing treatments and who have no alternative treatment options. Based on this, the FDA granted Barostim a Breakthrough Device designation for HFrEF in June 2015.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safe and effective treatment. Our clinical trial results demonstrated compelling safety and effectiveness data regarding the HFrEF clinical benefits of Barostim. These results showed significant improvement in the following HF patient-centered outcomes:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality of life (measured by MLWHF): Our therapy demonstrated a 14-point improvement in quality of life for patients in the device arm relative to patients in the control arm. A 5-point improvement is considered to be clinically meaningful.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exercise capacity (measured by the standardized 6MHW distance test): Our therapy demonstrated that patients in the device arm were able to improve their walking distance in a six-minute period by 60 meters more than that of patients in the control arm. A 25-meter improvement in walking distance is considered to be clinically meaningful.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




• | Functional status (determined by NYHA classification): Our therapy demonstrated that 65% of patients who were in the device arm improved at least one NYHA class as compared to only 31% in the control arm, with 13% of patients improving two NYHA classes in the device arm as compared to only 2% in the control arm.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NT-proBNP (Serum biomarker used as indicator of severity of HF): Our therapy demonstrated that patients in the device arm had a 25% improvement in NT-proBNP relative to that of patients in the control arm. A 10% improvement is considered to be clinically meaningful.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The significant benefits of our therapy were observed despite a four-fold uptake of ARNI medication in the control arm, as compared to the device arm.
​

• | Widely accepted mechanism of action. Our platform technology is based on a widely accepted mechanism of action and is designed to address the imbalance of the ANS, which causes HFrEF and other cardiovascular diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong global clinical evidence. The benefits of treatment with Barostim were shown to be similarly robust and reproducible across all three of our HF clinical studies, including BAT-in-HF (Phase I), HOPE4HF (Phase II) and BeAT-HF (Phase III pivotal trial), evaluating 624 patients in aggregate across the U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Canada and the United Kingdom. The BeAT-HF pivotal trial, which was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, met its primary endpoints and the positive safety and effectiveness data exceeded the pre-specified performance criteria across multiple dimensions, measuring the improvement in the quality of patients’ daily lives. Barostim Therapy’s trial results have been published in more than 60 peer-reviewed publications, approximately 20 of which relate to the treatment of HF, including, among others, the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimally invasive implant procedure. Barostim’s IPG and stimulation lead are implanted during a minimally invasive implant procedure typically performed in an outpatient setting that lasts approximately one hour and involves two small skin incisions. Our device does not require hardware to be implanted in the heart or vasculature, which is the case with most other device-based treatments indicated for different HFrEF patient populations. Patients typically recover quickly and are discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of the procedure. In addition, we are currently developing a new implant toolkit called BATwire, which enables an ultrasound-guided procedure to implant Barostim and the use of local anesthetics. As a result of this simplified implantation process, we believe more physicians, including EPs, would be confident and comfortable implanting Barostim, thereby expanding our addressable patient population to include those who are deemed clinically unfit for the current procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential reduction in total healthcare costs for HFrEF patients. In addition to providing improved physical and health-related benefits and quality of life for patients, we estimate Barostim has the potential to result in cost savings to healthcare systems. A Company-sponsored and co-authored cost-impact analysis, which was published in BMC Cardiovascular Disorders, a peer-reviewed manuscript, predicted BAT plus GDMT would become the lower-cost alternative treatment within three years from implantation, as compared to GDMT alone, resulting in significant cost savings to healthcare systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inherent patient compliance and durability. Barostim ensures patient compliance, unlike most commercially available drug treatments, as it requires no device interaction by the patient. Our device has a battery that does not require recharging, has an average service life of five years and is replaced through a short outpatient procedure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical results and studies
The safety and effectiveness of Barostim in HFrEF is supported by compelling data, which demonstrated similarly robust and reproducible results across our three clinical trials evaluating 624 patients in aggregate across the U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Canada and the United Kingdom. We designed our BeAT-HF (Phase III) pivotal trial in collaboration with the FDA under the Breakthrough Devices Program, which was 

20



implemented to accelerate the approval of novel therapies targeting unmet needs for debilitating or life-threatening conditions. Our BeAT-HF pivotal trial met the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints and demonstrated meaningful improvement in the quality of life, both physically and emotionally, for patients suffering from HFrEF. These results led to the FDA approval of Barostim in August 2019 on an accelerated basis of only four months from the submission of the final clinical trial report.
​
Barostim is indicated for the improvement of symptoms of HFrEF — quality of life, 6MHW and functional status — for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with GDMT, are NYHA Class III or Class II (with a recent history of Class III), have a LVEF ≤ 35%, a NT-proBNP < 1,600 pg/ml and excluding patients indicated for CRT according to AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines.
​
The safety and effectiveness of Barostim Therapy have been published in more than 60 peer-reviewed publications, approximately 20 of which relate to the treatment of HF, including, among others, the publication of the pivotal trial results in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The table below summarizes the clinical measurements, results and outcomes from our HF trials, including improvements in HF symptoms, patient-reported quality of life measures and our therapy’s favorable safety profile.
​
​
We have established a U.S. patient registry to evaluate and assess real world patient outcomes from patients who have been implanted with Barostim. Investment in clinical evidence continues to be one of our core strategies, and we intend to continue to develop and expand upon a significant body of published clinical evidence that supports the safety and effectiveness of Barostim Therapy.
​
Pivotal Phase III Study: BeAT-HF
Overview
​
BeAT-HF is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial that began in April 2016 to develop scientific evidence for the safety and effectiveness of BAT with Barostim. Between May 2016 and July 2020, 467 adult patients were randomized at 72 sites within the U.S. and one site in the United Kingdom.
​
The BeAT-HF study was designed to encompass two stages in an integrated and seamless approach:
​
(1)   A pre-market stage that examined three primary effectiveness endpoints, quality of life, 6MHW and NT-proBNP as well as one safety endpoint that included the major adverse neurological or cardiovascular system or procedure-related event rate (“MANCE”).
​

21



(2)   A post-market stage that will examine the effects of BAT on rates of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality and potentially expand the indication for Barostim.
​
Patients were eligible for the trial if they were NYHA Class III or Class II (with a recent history of Class III); had an LVEF ≤ 35% and NT-proBNP < 1,600 pg/ml; were able to complete a 6MHW distance of 150 to 400 meters; were on stable optimal GDMT for ≥ 4 weeks; had at least one carotid artery that was below the level of the mandible with no ulcerative carotid arterial plaques or stenosis ≥ 50%; and were an acceptable surgical candidate.
​
Patients who had AHA/ACC/ESC Class I indication for a CRT were excluded, and there were no restrictions for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
​
Patients who met all eligibility criteria with complete baseline measurements were randomized 1:1 to receive Barostim Therapy plus GDMT (“BAT+”) or GDMT alone (“Control”). BAT+ was delivered by implanting patients with a Barostim Neo System, while keeping the patient on maximally tolerated GDMT. Control was defined as maximally tolerated GDMT.
​
In the pre-market stage of the BeAT-HF pivotal trial, four patient cohorts were developed in collaboration with the FDA under the Breakthrough Devices Program and shown in the following graphic:
​
​

• | Cohort A (n=271): In the six-month data available, improvements were seen in two of the three primary effectiveness endpoints, and the safety endpoint MANCE-free rate of 94% exceeded the performance criteria of 85% (p = 0.002). There was no statistically significant reduction in NT-proBNP observed, which contrasted the significant reduction of NT-proBNP seen in the HOPE4HF Phase II trial.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cohort B (n=162): Results from cohort A led to the hypothesis-generating cohort B, which included 162 of the 271 patients in cohort A with an NT-proBNP < 1,600 pg/ml. In the six-month data available, improvements were seen in all three primary effectiveness endpoints and resulted in a MANCE-free rate of 97%. A hypothesis was then formally articulated in a revised statistical analysis plan (“SAP”). This SAP was submitted and reviewed with FDA before the cohort C completed its six-month follow-up period.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22




• | Cohort C (n=102): Results from cohort B led to the hypothesis-confirming cohort C, which consisted of 102 patients with NT-proBNP <1,600 pg/ml. In the six-month data available for cohort C, improvements were seen in all three primary effectiveness endpoints. This confirmed the findings in cohort B.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cohort D (n=264): Cohort D is a combined cohort, representing the intended use population, and consisted of 264 patients combined from cohorts B and C. Data from cohort D was used to define the indication for use and the labeling of Barostim in the PMA submission.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trial results
​
The study consisted of 1,090 enrolled patients across 92 centers, of which 467 met the eligibility criteria and were randomized in the trial. In the pre-market stage, 264 randomized patients who met the intended use criteria were randomized 1:1 with 130 patients in the BAT+ group and 134 patients in the Control group.
​
​
The safety and effectiveness data in the BeAT-HF pivotal trial support the HFrEF clinical benefits of Barostim. These results demonstrated that BAT is safe in patients with HFrEF and significantly improves the patient-

23



centered symptomatic endpoints of the quality of life score, 6MHW and functional status, as well as the confirmatory nature of the evidence provided by a reduction of NT-proBNP.
​

• | Quality of life (measured by MLWHF): BAT resulted in a 14-point reduction (improvement) in quality of life for patients in the BAT+ group relative to patients in the Control group (p < 0.001; 95% CI: -19 to -9). MLWHF is a self-administered disease-specific questionnaire for HF, which is comprised of 21 questions rated on six-point Likert scales, representing different degrees of impact of HF on a patient’s quality of life, and is approved by the FDA as a Medical Device Development Tool. According to the medical community, a five-point reduction (improvement) is considered to be clinically meaningful.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exercise capacity (measured by the standardized 6MHW distance test): BAT resulted in a 60-meter increase in the distance patients in the BAT+ group were able to walk on a flat, hard surface in a six-minute period relative to that of patients in the Control group (p < 0.001; 95% CI: 40 to 80 meters). According to the medical community, the 6MHW is an index of a patient’s ability to perform daily activities; an improvement of 25 meters or more is considered to be clinically meaningful to HFrEF patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Functional status (determined by NYHA classification): BAT demonstrated that 65% of patients in the BAT+ group improved at least one NYHA class (p < 0.001; 95% CI: 22% to 46%) as compared to only 31% in the Control group, and 13% of patients in the BAT+ group improved two NYHA classes as compared to only 2% in the Control group.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NT-proBNP (serum biomarker used as indicator of severity of HF): BAT resulted in a 25% greater reduction (improvement) in NT-proBNP for patients in the BAT+ group relative to that of patients in the Control group (p=0.004; 95% CI = -38% to -9%). According to independent research that took place in a large multicenter pharmaceutical clinical trial, a 10% change in NT-proBNP is associated with a change in the subsequent risk of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety
​
The MANCE-free rate exceeded the performance criteria of 85%, with 121 out of 125 implanted patients being event free, resulting in an event-free rate of 97% (p < 0.001; 95% 1-sided CI: 93% to 100%).
​
Effectiveness results in context
​
While Barostim is not intended to compete with CRT therapies, it is useful to compare the symptomatic results achieved by CRT devices when they were initially FDA approved. Patients suffering from HFrEF have similar outcomes and symptoms irrespective of whether they are indicated for CRT, and thus provide a good proxy to understand the adoption of these therapies.
​

​
The results presented in this table have been derived from publicly available reports of clinical trials run independently of the Company or meta-analyses of such clinical results. The Company has not performed any head-to-head trials comparing any of these other HF therapies with Barostim. As such, the results of these other clinical trials may not be comparable to clinical results for Barostim. The design of these other trials vary in material ways from the design of the clinical trials for Barostim. For further information and to understand these material differences, you should read the relevant reports or meta-analyses.
​
Ancillary analysis
​
During the initial six-month follow-up period, there was a disproportionately higher number of medications added in the Control group when compared to BAT+ group. Control patients were more likely to have a new class of drugs added (36 [29%] Control vs 21 [18%] in BAT+; difference of 11%, p=0.049; 95% CI: 1% to 22%) and were more likely to have a new ARNI added (20 [16%] Control vs 5 [4%] BAT+; difference of 12%, p=0.003; 95% CI: 4% to 19%). The significant symptomatic improvement in the BAT+ group demonstrated in the trial was observed despite a disproportionate increase in the number of medications in the Control group.
​
In addition to the results noted above, we observed a reduction in the rate of cardiovascular serious adverse events (non-HF related events) by 51% (events per patient-year; 0.101 BAT+ vs 0.206 Control; nominal p= 0.023; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.73) and there were no significant differences in blood pressure or heart rate.
​
The BeAT-HF pivotal trial continued enrolling patients in the post-market stage of the trial in order to determine if Barostim demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF. Enrollment was completed and patient follow-up continues to collect morbidity and mortality events until the pre-specified number of events has been accumulated. The patient follow-up data is expected to accrue by the end of 2022. If we successfully obtain FDA approval for a morbidity and mortality indication in HFrEF, we believe our addressable patient population would expand significantly and our therapy could be included at a higher class in the HF medical guidelines.

Phase II Study: HOPE4HF
HOPE4HF was a multinational, prospective, randomized, controlled trial that began in May 2012 to demonstrate the safety and performance of BAT with Barostim. A total of 146 patients (72 in the U.S. and 74 in Germany, Italy, France and Canada) at 45 centers were randomized 1:1 with 76 patients in the BAT+ group and 70 patients in the Control group.
​
Patients were eligible for the study based on symptoms, historical treatment plan and anatomical criteria, including if they were NYHA Class III, received GDMT for their HF, had a LVEF ≤ 35% and were considered a suitable surgical candidate, among others. Patients were excluded from the study if they had recently experienced NYHA Class IV, recently received an ICD or CRT, or had known baroreflex failure, among others.
​
The safety endpoints were system- and procedure-related complications and system- and procedure-related MANCE within six months of implantation. The effectiveness endpoints included changes in functional status, quality of life as measured by the MLWHF, exercise capacity as measured by 6MHW distance, cardiac function as measured by echocardiography and serum biomarkers. Additional hypothesis generating observations were made to assess outcome as measured by HF hospitalizations and HF hospitalization days.
​
Results
​
The overall MANCE-free rate was 97% (lower 95% CI bound 91%). Patients assigned to BAT+ group, compared with Control group patients, experienced improvements in MLWHF quality of life score (–17 ± 2.8 points BAT+ vs. 2.1 ± 3.1 points Control; p < 0.001), 6MHW distance (60 ± 14 meters BAT+ vs. 1.5 ± 13 meters Control; p=0.004) and NT-pro BNP (-69 pg/ml BAT+ vs. 130 pg/ml Control; p =0.02). BAT+ patients also experienced at least a one-class improvement in NYHA class when compared to the Control group (55% BAT+ vs 24% Control; p=0.002) and showed a trend toward fewer days hospitalized for HF (p=0.08) as compared to the Control group.
​
Positive safety and performance results from the 146-patient combined, randomized, controlled clinical trials were presented in the late breaking clinical trial session of the American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology HF conference in 2015. The favorable data from this trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology — Heart Failure in 2015. These results led to CE Mark approval.
​
Subgroup analysis
​
The study had a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients who were treated at baseline with CRT versus patients without CRT. Of the 146 patients who were randomized, 140 were active at baseline: 45 patients had a CRT and 95 patients did not have a CRT. The results of this subgroup analysis showed a MANCE-free rate at six months of 100% in the CRT group and a 96% rate in the no-CRT group. At six months, the quality of life as measured by the MLWHF, 6MHW distance, LVEF and NT-pro BNP were significantly improved in the BAT+ group with no-CRT compared to control patients with no-CRT. In the no-CRT BAT+ group, HF hospitalizations were significantly reduced when comparing the periods before and after implant. Patients who received BAT+ showed a symptomatic improvement in the CRT group and the improvements were even more pronounced in the no-CRT group. The results of the substudy were presented in the Late Breaking Clinical Trial session of the Heart Rhythm Society in 2015 and published in the European Journal of Heart Failure. The substudy results led to FDA Breakthrough Device designation for HFrEF in June 2015.
​
Phase I Study: BAT in HF
BAT in HF was our first-in-human study of Barostim Therapy for the treatment of HF that was published in 2014. This study was a single-center, open-label evaluation, designed to evaluate the safety and performance of Barostim Therapy in patients with NYHA Class III receiving optimized medical therapy for their HF and had an LVEF ≤ 40%. Patients who had been implanted with a CRT device were excluded from 

26



this trial until six months after activation. Eleven patients met the eligibility criteria and received Barostim. After six months of Barostim Therapy, the mechanism of action was assessed with serial measurement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (“MSNA”) and clinical measures of quality of life and functional capacity.
​
Results
​
MSNA was reduced over six months from 45 ± 7.7 to 31 ± 8.3 bursts/minute and from 68 ± 13 to 45 ± 12 bursts/​100 heartbeats, decreases of 31% and 33%, respectively (p < 0.01). Concomitant improvements occurred in baroreflex sensitivity, ejection fraction, NYHA class and quality of life as measured by the MLWHF and 6MHW distance (p ≤ 0.05 each). On an observational basis, hospitalization and emergency department visits for worsening HF were reduced.
​
This study provided the first evidence that chronic stimulation of carotid baroreceptors markedly and persistently reduced the sympathetic activation characterizing HF patients. It also demonstrated that the reduction is accompanied by the improvement of a major modulator of sympathetic activity, the arterial baroreflex and baroreflex activation is accompanied by favorable therapeutic impact on cardiac function and clinical profile, as shown in the improved quality of life, increased exercise tolerance and improved functional status.
​
Other clinical trials
BATwire implant toolkit
​
In the second half of 2020, the FDA approved a two-stage pivotal trial design to assess the safety and effectiveness of the BATwire implant toolkit. This trial is expected to enroll 180 subjects and follow 71 implanted subjects for one year. If the trial data meets the safety and effectiveness endpoints, we will submit an application for a PMA-supplement approval by FDA.
​
Hypertension
​
We have completed two clinical trials in Europe and North America for the treatment of drug-resistant hypertension using our first-generation Barostim Therapy device called Rheos, including a randomized, controlled double-blinded 322-patient trial that completed enrollment in 2009. In 2010, we determined this study was successful in achieving three of the required five safety and effectiveness endpoints (“Baroreflex Activation Therapy Lowers Blood Pressure in Patients with Resistant Hypertension: Results from the Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Rheos Pivotal Trial,” by John D. Bisognano, M.D. et al that was published in 2011 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, volume 58, No. 7, 2011). Because of these results, we decided not to pursue PMA approval of the Rheos device, and instead focused our development roadmap on completing our second-generation system, Barostim. In 2014 we submitted a request for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (“HDE”) to commercialize Barostim Legacy, our second generation IPG for the subjects that were enrolled in the Rheos Pivotal trial, who are benefitting clinically from Rheos (estimated at the time to be 70–80% of the subjects enrolled) and whose IPG battery had become depleted. In December 2014, after a favorable review of the long-term clinical data from the Rheos pivotal hypertension trial, the FDA granted the HDE to Barostim Legacy.
​
Since 2011, we have completed one clinical trial in Europe and North America for the treatment of drug-resistant hypertension using Barostim (“Minimally Invasive System for Baroreflex Activation Therapy Chronically Lowers Blood Pressure with Pacemaker-like Safety Profile: Results from the Barostim Neo Trial,” by Uta C. Hoppe, M.D. et al, in the Journal of the American Society of Hypertension, volume 5, no. 4, 2012).
​
In August 2011, we received CE Mark approval for Barostim for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In October 2012, we received FDA approval to conduct a pivotal trial for the treatment of resistant hypertension entitled “Barostim Hypertension Pivotal Study.” On April 12, 2013, the study had its first enrollment. However, a redirection of our limited available financial and personnel resources to develop Barostim Therapy in HFrEF led to putting the trial on hold. In December 2019, after review of the clinical data and the competitive 

27



landscape, FDA granted a Breakthrough Device designation for Barostim for the treatment of resistant hypertension.
​
HFpEF
​
In March 2020, after review of early clinical data and the competitive landscape, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Device designation for Barostim for the treatment of HFpEF.
​
Sales and marketing
We have established a systematic approach to market development which centers on active engagement across three key stakeholders in the HFrEF treatment paradigm—patients, physicians and hospitals.
​
Barostim has FDA approval to improve symptoms of HFrEF in the U.S. and CE Mark for the treatment of HFrEF and hypertension in Europe. We market our therapy in the U.S. to hospitals and clinics where EPs, HF specialists, general cardiologists and vascular surgeons treat patients with HFrEF.
​
We primarily sell Barostim to hospitals through a direct sales organization in the U.S. and Germany, and through distributors in Austria, Spain, Italy, the Nordic region and other European countries. Our global sales and marketing team engages in sales efforts and promotional activities focused on EPs, HF specialists, general cardiologists and vascular surgeons. We are actively expanding our direct sales force and commercial organization in the U.S., which is where we expect to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts in the near-term.
​
Our direct sales representatives, which we refer to as Account Managers, generally have substantial and applicable medical device experience, specifically in the cardiovascular space, and market our products directly to the approximately 2,500 EPs, 800 HF specialists and 20,000 general cardiologists in the U.S. We support these physicians through all aspects of the patient journey, which includes initial diagnosis, surgical support and patient follow-up. Our Account Managers are focused on prioritizing high volume EP centers that are strategically located and on building long-standing relationships with key physicians who have strong connectivity to the HFrEF patient population that may be eligible for our therapy. We also employ Field Clinical Specialists who generally have experience in medical device clinical support. Our Field Clinical Specialists work to ensure that every procedure is done correctly by educating the implanting physicians, including vascular surgeons and EPs, about the technical aspects of Barostim and the implantation procedure.
​
Similar to our direct sales team, our marketing team has a significant amount of relevant expertise and a strong track record of success in the medical device industry. Our marketing organization is focused on building physician awareness through targeted KOL development, referral network education and direct-to-consumer marketing.
​
In terms of patient education, we utilize direct communication channels to inform patients about Barostim Therapy and to enable them to connect with active sites that offer Barostim. Our primary method of patient outreach is through digital social networks. We use a qualification process to aid in the identification of the appropriate patients for our therapy. The objective of this outreach is to target these patients and make them aware of our education webinars and website, where they can find a wealth of information on HFrEF and the purpose and benefits of Barostim Therapy, based on our approved labeling.
​
In addition to driving broad awareness and increasing physician and patient education, our marketing team has developed the in-house resources necessary to assist patients and physicians in the process of obtaining prior authorization approval for their procedures.
​

Third-party coverage and reimbursement
Coding and payment in the United States
In the U.S., we sell Barostim primarily to hospitals, where the device is implanted in an outpatient setting. Our customers bill various third-party payors, such as government agencies, administrative contractors, commercial payors and integrated managed care organizations, for the cost required to treat each patient.
​
Third-party payors generally require physicians and hospitals to identify the service for which they are seeking reimbursement for by using CPT codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association. Implantation of Barostim is described by CPT code 0266T, a Category III code approved in July 2011 and effective as of January 2012. Hospitals are able to use this code to submit for a system implant payment. CPT code 0268T is used to submit for an IPG replacement procedure payment, and CPT codes 0272T and 0273T are used for interrogation and programming of the IPG, respectively.
​
Physician reimbursement under Medicare is generally based on a defined fee schedule, the Physician Fee Schedule, through which payment amounts are determined by the relative values of the professional services rendered. Medicare provides reimbursement to hospitals using Barostim under the hospital outpatient prospective system (“HOPPS”), which provides bundled amounts generally intended to reimburse a hospital for all facility costs related to procedures performed in its outpatient setting. Under the HOPPS, the national Medicare payment to a hospital for a new patient implant or an IPG replacement is paid using the Level 5 Neurostimulator payment code APC 5465, which has a national average of $30,063 in 2022. Payment codes such as APC 5465 are indexed to adjust for cost of living and thus vary by location. These payments generally cover the hospital’s costs for the device and the implantation procedure. CMS also granted a TPT payment for the implantation of Barostim in an outpatient setting, which took effect in January 2021. The TPT payment is an incremental payment for new and innovative technologies that meet certain qualifications. It allows hospitals to bill for a pass-through of the device cost, which includes up to $35,000, and can be added to the procedure costs.
​
We anticipate inpatient procedures to continue to represent a small percentage of our sales. For these inpatient procedures, ICD-10-PCS codes 0JH60MZ + 03HL3M are commonly mapped into Diagnosis Related Group (“DRG”) 252, which has an established national average Medicare payment of $21,930 in 2022. CMS also granted an NTAP that is added to the DRG for a three-year period starting in October 2020 to cover the implantation of Barostim in an inpatient setting. The NTAP is an incremental inpatient payment for new and innovative technologies that meet certain qualifications. This payment allows hospitals to be reimbursed an additional $22,750 (65% of the total cost of the device), for a total national average Medicare payment of $44,680 in 2022.
​
The surgeon implanting Barostim is paid an additional physician payment under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which we believe is a reasonable amount for this type of procedure. The physician that manages the device performs multiple device interrogations and is paid using the payment code APC 5721, which has a national average of $140 per visit in 2022.
​
Reimbursement rates from commercial payors vary depending on a variety of factors, including, the commercial payor and contract terms.
​
Government program and commercial payor coverage in the United States
A core pillar of our reimbursement strategy involves continuing to broaden our current coverage. Since approximately 67% of our target treatment population includes Medicare-eligible patients, we have prioritized CMS coverage while simultaneously developing processes to engage commercial payors. As of July 2020, all MACs have retired automatic coverage denial policies, thereby allowing hospitals to be paid for our procedure. In November 2021 CMS repealed its proposed rule entitled “Medicare Program; Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology (“MCIT”) and Definition of ‘Reasonable and Necessary,’” which would have created an expedited process for Medicare coverage for breakthrough devices, and created greater 

29



clarity around the definition of “reasonable and necessary” for coverage determinations. Although the rule has been repealed, existing mechanisms remain to obtain Medicare coverage for breakthrough devices. CMS has committed to considering additional process improvements to increase access to innovative devices. We will continue to monitor developments in this space, including decisions made by private payors, if any. 
​
A second pillar of our reimbursement strategy includes leveraging our in-house market access team to assist patients and physicians in obtaining appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of treatment on a case-by-case basis where positive coverage policies currently do not exist. We believe our market access team is highly effective in working with patients and physicians to obtain prior authorizations for systems similar to Barostim, including handling the appeals process. We believe that we will continue to benefit from this efficient prior authorization process in the near-and-long-term by expanding on our positive coverage policies with commercial payors. We intend to have discussions with commercial payors to establish these positive coverage policies by highlighting our compelling and robust clinical data, the potential economic cost-savings associated with our highly compliant treatment, increased patient demand and support from leading medical societies and KOLs. As our operations continue to grow, we intend to further expand our market access team accordingly.
​
Reimbursement outside of the United States
Outside the U.S., reimbursement levels vary by country and within some countries, by region. We are currently selling Barostim in Germany, where the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information supports various codes for reimbursement coverage. OPS code 5-059.c6 covers the implantation or replacement of a device stimulating the peripheral nervous system by activating the baroreceptors. This OPS code is combined with G-DRG ICD I50.13 to cover reimbursement of Barostim for the treatment of HFrEF. It can also be combined with G-DRG ICD I10.10 to cover reimbursement of Barostim for the treatment of hypertension. These DRG codes for both indications are combined with ZE code ZE2021-86 to cover the cost of the device. Barostim also is eligible for reimbursement in certain other European countries, where annual healthcare budgets for the hospital generally determine the number of patients to be treated and the prices to be paid for the related devices that may be purchased.
​
Research and development
Our research and development team has significant experience bringing innovative medical devices to market, including minimally invasive neuromodulation systems.
​
We are committed to ongoing research and development efforts of Barostim with an emphasis on improving clinical outcomes, optimizing patient adoption and comfort, increasing access for a greater number of patients and allowing more physicians to perform the procedure.
​
The primary focus of our research and development efforts in the near-term will be the continued technological advancement of Barostim, including tools to simplify the implant procedure for physicians. For example, in 2022 we expect to launch an enhanced IPG that will be approximately 10% smaller in size and improve the battery life by approximately 20% to an average of six years. We are also developing a new implant toolkit called BATwire, which enables an ultrasound-guided procedure to implant Barostim and the use of local anesthetics. This has the potential to expand our annual market opportunity in the U.S. by an estimated $1 billion, or by 39,000 additional patients who are deemed clinically unfit for the current procedure. This simplified procedure would also allow EPs to complete the procedure in an outpatient catheter lab center.
​
While we are currently focused on the treatment of patients with HFrEF, we believe our platform technology can provide meaningful benefits to a broader set of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases with significant unmet needs. If we receive positive mortality and morbidity data from the post-market stage of the BeAT-HF pivotal trial, we plan to request that the FDA limit certain patient exclusions and add the claim “Treatment for Heart Failure” to our current indication. We believe this would increase our annual market 

30



opportunity in the U.S. by an estimated $2.2 billion, or by 88,000 additional patients. Our longer-term goal is to explore Barostim’s potential to expand the indications for use to other cardiovascular diseases, including different forms of HF, hypertension and arrhythmias. Expansions into these or other new indications would require additional FDA approvals and may involve additional clinical trials or modifications to Barostim to treat such indications. If clinical studies for future indications do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the U.S. or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize our products for these indications.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred research and development expenses of $7.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively. 
​
Competition
Our industry is subject to rapid change from the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. We consider our primary competition to be other device-based therapies designed to treat patients with HFrEF and a narrow QRS complex.
​
There is only one other commercially available device-based option, CCM, that targets a limited subset of the same HFrEF patient population indicated for Barostim. CCM is offered by a single privately-held medical technology company and has the potential to improve a patient’s quality of life and reduce symptoms of HFrEF. However, CCM is associated with a number of drawbacks, including not being designed to address the imbalance of the ANS; less favorable clinical effectiveness results in patients with LVEF 25–35% as compared to patients with LVEF 35–45% related to exercise capacity, quality of life and functional status; implantation through an invasive procedure that includes running electrical leads through the veins and attaching them to the heart’s ventricle, which may lead to increased risks to the patient; and the requirement that patients regularly charge the battery in their implanted device.
​
We believe that the primary competitive factors in the HFrEF treatment market are:
​

• | product safety, reliability and durability;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | quality and volume of clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------


• | adoption by patients, physicians and hospitals;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | adequate reimbursement for our device;
--+---------------------------------------


• | product ease of use and patient comfort;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | sales force expansion, experience and access;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | product availability, support and service;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing and supply chain;
--+--------------------------------


• | technological innovation and product enhancements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | intellectual property portfolio.
--+---------------------------------

Aside from device-based treatments, pharmaceutical therapies are widely used to treat HFrEF and have been in use longer and are better known to physicians and patients than Barostim. However, because Barostim is designed to be used in conjunction with pharmaceutical therapies to alleviate the symptoms of HFrEF, we do not consider existing pharmaceutical therapies to be direct competitors.
​

31



We also compete with other medical technology companies to recruit and retain qualified sales, training and other personnel.
​
Intellectual property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 54 issued U.S. patents and had three pending U.S. patent applications. Outside of the U.S., we owned seven patents in multiple countries and had one pending application. Our trademark portfolio focuses on nine trademarks in the U.S. and multiple other countries. Our patents cover aspects of our integrated platform technology, Barostim, including baroreflex methods, stimulus regimes, mapping methods, electrode designs, disease treatments, closed loop control, burst intervals, connection structures and baroreceptor locations, as well as future product concepts. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents, and we have not received any notices of patent infringement. 
​
We also rely, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
​
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights or provide us with any competitive advantage. While there is no active litigation involving any of our patents or other intellectual property rights and we have not received any notices of patent infringement, we may be required to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against third parties in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
​
Manufacturing and supply
We manage all aspects of manufacturing operations and product supply of Barostim, which includes final assembly, testing and packaging of our IPG and stimulation lead, at our 23,890 square foot headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. With minimal capital investment, our existing operations are capable of producing 5,000 IPGs and 5,000 stimulation leads per shift per year, and our manufacturing line was designed to be expandable and scalable in the future.
​
We currently source certain components for Barostim from a limited number of suppliers, including the module, module board, radio-frequency module, magnet switch, battery and application-specific integrated circuits for the IPG and the electrode for the stimulation lead. Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us and test our components and devices to meet our specifications. We maintain sufficient levels of inventory to mitigate potential supply disruption and to achieve more favorable volume-based pricing. We continue to seek to broaden and strengthen our supply chain through additional sourcing channels.
​
We select our suppliers to ensure that Barostim and its components are safe and effective, adhere to all applicable standards and regulations, are high quality and meet our supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA and relevant Canadian, European Union (“EU”) and Australian regulatory authorities and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits. We received ISO certification for our quality management system and our most recent audits have not identified any major nonconformities. We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and licensed by the State of Minnesota to manufacture our device.

32



​
Seasonality
​
We expect that any revenue we generate could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of timing and seasonality. We anticipate mild seasonality based on national holiday patterns specific to certain nations. These seasonal variations are difficult to predict accurately and may vary amongst different markets. In addition to the above factors, in the U.S. it is possible that we may experience seasonality based on patients’ annual deductibility limits under their health insurance coverage. In Europe, we may be required to engage in a contract bidding process in order to sell Barostim, which processes are only open at certain periods of time, and we may not be successful in such bidding processes. In addition, it is possible that we may experience variations in demand for our product in the first fiscal quarter of each year in Europe, following publication of new coverage status and changes in hospital budgets pertaining to allocation of funds to purchase products such as Barostim.
​
Government regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the U.S., as well as comparable authorities in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, device tracking, adverse event reporting, recalls, safety alerts, injunctions, seizures, bans, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
​
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials or commercialize our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
​
FDA pre-market clearance and approval requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, HDE, or PMA approval. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III or De Novo—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. De Novo is a medical device with no prior predicate device or premarket device for comparing substantial equivalence to; however, the FDA believes it is subject to 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally 

33



marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
​
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of an HDE or PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
​
Our currently U.S. marketed Barostim devices are Class III devices which have received both a PMA and an HDE approval.
​
PMA & HDE approval pathway
Class III devices require PMA or HDE approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and at times can take up to several years. An Advisory Committee or panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.
​
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s) according to the instructions for use or labeling. The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance or study when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
​
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and typically does not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the HDE constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and has probable benefit for its intended use(s) according to the instructions for use or labeling. The HDE approved devices are subject to the same requirement elements and changes as the above PMA devices. An additional limitation for HDE devices is they must be prescribed for a patient population that has a medical condition or disease that afflicts less than 8,000 people per year in the United States and have been designated as a Humanitarian Use Device by FDA.
​
Clinical trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support an HDE, 510(k) or De Novo submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
​
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an institutional review board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of subjects, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
​
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators, informed consent for subjects, financial reporting on investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain subject informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.

Post-market regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
​

• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Sunshine Act and various state and foreign laws on reporting remunerative relationships with health care customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and thus constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statute;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA and HDE devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with the federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

36



We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file and complaint files. As a manufacturer, our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
​
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
​

• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, injunctions, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Regulation of medical devices in the EEA
In the EEA, in order to be placed on the market, medical devices require a CE Mark and a corresponding declaration of conformity. For our medical devices, the CE Mark must be issued by an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, a so-called Notified Body. Conformity assessments are conducted to demonstrate that the medical device meets the legal requirements set forth in the regulations and standards to ensure that it meets general safety and performance criteria. Clinical investigations or evidence of the safety and clinical outcomes, among other things, may be required for issuance of a CE Mark. With a CE Mark, the medical devices are generally marketable in the entire EEA. A CE Mark was issued for Barostim for the treatment of hypertension in 2011 and for the treatment of HFrEF in 2014.
​
Medical devices regulated under the MDD (as defined below) are classified into one of four classes — Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb or Class III — based on the extent of the regulatory controls necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. The Automatic Implantable Medical Device Directive (“AIMDD”) applies to implantable electrical active medical devices that are typically considered to be Class III under MDD and similar controls for the highest risk devices. The classification corresponds to the level of potential hazard inherent in the type of device concerned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient. Class IIa and Class IIb devices are higher risk devices and Class III devices are devices with a significant risk, which are subject to more regulatory oversight to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards and post-market surveillance. Barostim is classified and regulated under the AIMDD.

EU Legislation: medical devices regulation
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the MDR (as defined below). The regulations entered into force on May 25, 2017 and progressively replaced the MDD after a transition period. The transition period was extended in April 2020, and the regulation became fully effective on May 26, 2021. Until then, different European countries interpreted and implemented the MDD and AIMDD in different ways. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and to ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The regulations impose strict demands on medical device manufacturers and the Notified Bodies whom they must involve in the conformity assessment procedure. The new regulations:
​

• | Require demonstration of clinically meaningful outcomes for the performance of the medical device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Require stricter control of Class IIb and Class III medical devices during the clinical investigational phase;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Require rigorous post-market oversight by the manufacturer and increased post-market surveillance authority by the Notified Body, including unannounced audits, and product sample checks and testing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide greater transparency by establishing a central database (EUDAMED) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, which may have to undergo an additional check by an independent expert panel before they are placed on the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The regulatory framework governing medical devices underwent a major change when the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745 — “MDR”) became effective. The MDR repealed and replaced the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC — “MDD” or Council Directive 90/385/EEC). Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA, the regulations are directly applicable, without the need for adoption by EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member states. To avoid market disruption and allow a smooth transition from the MDD/AIMDD to the MDR, several transitional provisions are in place, which include the certificates provided under the MDD/AIMDD remaining valid and devices lawfully placed on the market continuing to be made available on the market or put into service, both under certain prerequisites and until a certain time.
​
Regulation of medical devices under MDR
CE Marking
Manufacturers of medical devices must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the MDR in order to obtain a CE mark for the product and market the product in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which requires the involvement of a Notified Body except for low-risk medical devices of Class I. The Notified Body typically audits the quality management system of the manufacturer, which must comply with the current version of ISO 13485, which requires manufacturers to follow defined and approved design and development procedures, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures throughout the entire design and manufacturing process. The Notified Body also reviews the Technical File that includes the Biological Evaluation, Clinical Evaluation and Risk 

38



Management reports, among other items, submitted for approval of the CE Mark. If the quality management system audit and the technical file review is successful, the Notified Body issues certificates of conformity. These certificates entitle the manufacturer to draw up the EU declaration of conformity and affix the CE Mark to the labeling of its medical devices and place the medical device on the market.
​
CE marking in UK
Since January 1, 2021, a medical device with an EEA-issued CE mark will continue to be recognized in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) until June 30, 2023. Certificates issued by EU-recognized Notified Bodies will continue to be valid for the UK market until June 30, 2023. Since January 1, 2021, all medical devices placed on the UK market need to be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”). There are different grace periods depending on the type of medical device to allow time for compliance with the new registration process. Where a medical device is not already registered with the MHRA, a conformity assessment must be conducted by an “authorised” body (a so-called UK Approved Body, approved by the MHRA) and a separate dossier application for the UK Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) marking must be submitted. However, the data to support an EEA-issued CE mark will probably be sufficient for a UKCA mark. Manufacturers based outside the UK who wish to place a device on the UK market need to appoint a single UK Responsible Person who will take responsibility for the product in the UK.
​
Clinical investigation
For our medical devices, clinical investigations or evidence will be required to demonstrate safety, performance and the expected clinical outcomes. The term “performance” describes how the medical device functions. Under the MDR, performance must be linked to expected clinical metrics and outcomes. From a practical standpoint, “performance” is analogous to the term “effectiveness” when applied to our medical devices. Clinical investigations must be conducted in accord with Good Clinical Practices (ISO 14155) and are subject to audits by the Notified Bodies.
​
Post-market surveillance
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, which link to the manufacturer’s continuous review of risk management information. As an integral part of its quality management system, the manufacturer must establish and maintain a systematic procedure to proactively collect and review real-life experience and data gained from their devices placed on the market. Post-market surveillance is comprised of, but not limited to, reports of serious adverse events, device deficiency reports, product complaints from consumers and health care professionals, field safety corrective actions and post-marketing clinical studies/updated clinical evaluation reports. Manufacturers must guarantee that their medical device continues to provide the promised benefit to patients as well as the lack of any unacceptable risks, through a constant and systematic approach to post-market surveillance. Further, manufacturers, medical practitioners and medical institutions are obliged to report any incident involving a medical device, including any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labelling or the instructions for use which might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or to a serious deterioration in his or her state of health. The reporting also includes any device recalls. Manufacturers have to prepare a periodic safety update report for each device summarizing the results and conclusions of the analyses of the post-market surveillance data gathered.
​
Non-compliance
If we fail to comply with applicable EU regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with EU regulatory requirements could prevent us from developing, manufacturing and later selling the products in the EU.
​

Federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse and physician payment transparency laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
​
Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) issued regulations in July 1991, which HHS has referred to as “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (described below).
​
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. While we are not aware of any such intentions or actions, we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
​
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false 

40



submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act.
​
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”), was enacted, which modifies and clarifies certain provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act. In part, FERA amends the federal civil False Claims Act such that penalties may now apply to any person, including an organization that does not contract directly with the government, who knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid in part by the federal government. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
​
The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
​
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
​
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA member state legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Also, many U.S. states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
​
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Plan for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members), certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an 

41



aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”). Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
​
Data privacy and security laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), in the U.S.
​
HIPAA established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requires certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA also requires business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to PHI in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity, of covered entities to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure.
​
The HIPAA privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities as well as business associates, which are defined to include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a business associate. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify any individual whose PHI is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI as defined under HIPAA.
​
HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if the PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to HHS, which would post the violation on its website, and to the media. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $55,910 per violation, not to exceed $1.68 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment.
​
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities, such as us, and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.
​
In the EU, we may be subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations. We process data of both our employees and our customers, including health and medical 

42



information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws implementing each of them. Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the Data Protection Directive and E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
​
The requirements include that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on a legal grounds set out in the local laws and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant, not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected, be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. To the extent that we process, control or otherwise use sensitive data relating to living individuals (for example, patients’ health or medical information), more stringent rules apply, limiting the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates).
​
The new EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the previous data protection laws issued by each EU Member State based on the Directive 95/46/EC. Unlike the Directive (which needed to be transposed at national level), the GDPR text is directly applicable in each EU member state, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations, requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR are significant—the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of global turnover. The GDPR provides that EU Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business.
​
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law.
​
We depend on a number of third parties in relation to our provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation.

Healthcare reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of 

43



our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
​
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S., for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research and implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Moreover, the Biden Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance, effective in 2019.
​
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
​
We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
​
Anti-bribery and corruption laws
Our U.S. operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”). We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.

Environmental laws
Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the clean-up of properties contaminated by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position.
​
Human capital management
Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to 

44



attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 109 employees worldwide, all of which were employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
​
