Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Founded in 1986, Nautilus, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, "Nautilus" or the "Company") is a global leader in innovative home fitness solutions, headquartered in Vancouver, Washington and incorporated in the State of Washington in January 1993. We became a publicly traded company in May 1999 and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and traded under ticker symbol: NLS.
Our diverse brand portfolio includes Bowflex®, Schwinn®, JRNY® and Nautilus®, pursuant to which we sell a broad selection of exercise bikes, other cardio equipment, strength training products, and our JRNY® digital fitness platform.
Nautilus empowers healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. We sell our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments.
We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Nautilus empowers healthier living through individualized, connected-fitness experiences. We develop and market home fitness equipment and related products to meet the needs of a broad range of consumers. We have diversified our business by expanding our portfolio of high quality fitness equipment into multiple product lines utilizing our well-recognized brand names. We view the continual innovation of our product offerings as a key aspect of our business strategy. We regularly refresh our existing product lines with new technologies and finishes, and focus significant effort and resources on the development or acquisition of innovative new fitness products and technologies for introduction to the marketplace at periodic intervals.
Our long-term strategy involves:
•Enhancing our product lines by designing personalized connected-fitness equipment that meets or exceeds the high expectations of our existing and new customers;
•Continuing our investment in innovation, with a particular focus on expanding the reach of our digital platform, JRNY®;
•Creatively marketing our equipment, both directly to consumers and through our Retail customers, while leveraging our well-known brand names;
•Increasing our international Retail sales and distribution.
Table of Contents

Our long-term strategy incorporates the individual goals of our Direct and Retail businesses. Our Direct business focuses on: (i) the development of, or acquisition of rights to, unique, branded products and technologies; (ii) the application of creative, cost-effective ways to communicate the benefits of using our products; and (iii) making various payment options available to our customers. We are particularly attentive to Direct business metrics that provide feedback regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of our media marketing programs and attractiveness of third-party consumer financing programs. 
In our Retail business, we strive to develop long-term relationships with key retailers of sports or fitness equipment. The primary objectives of our Retail business are to: (i) offer a selection of innovative, unique products at key price-points to capture market share; and (ii) utilize the strength of our brands and long-standing customer relationships to secure more exposure in the stores or websites of our Retail customers.
PRODUCTS
We market quality cardiovascular and strength fitness products that cover a broad range of price points and features. Our products are designed for home use by individuals with varying exercise needs. From the person who works out occasionally to the serious athlete, we have products that will help them achieve their fitness objectives.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
We conduct our business in two segments, Direct and Retail. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers primarily through our websites. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent companies to reach consumers in the home use markets in the U.S. and internationally.
For further information regarding our segments and geographic information, see Note 22, Segment and Enterprise-Wide Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
SALES AND MARKETING
Direct
In our Direct business, we sell our products directly to consumers via our websites bowflex.com, bowflex.ca, schwinnfitness.com and nautilus.com.
Our marketing efforts are based on an integrated combination of media and direct consumer contact. In addition to television advertising, our marketing mix includes a combination of digital, search, shopping and social media, as well as email and direct mail campaigns. Marketing and media effectiveness is measured continuously based on web traffic, conversion rates, return on investment and other performance metrics and we strive to optimize the efficiency of our marketing and media expenditures based on this data. Almost all of our Direct customer orders are received either on our websites or through call centers.
Retail
In our Retail business, we market and sell a comprehensive line of consumer fitness equipment under the Bowflex®, Schwinn® and Nautilus® brands. Our products are marketed through a network of retail companies, via brick and mortar locations and those retailers' websites. Retail partners include online-only retailers, sporting goods stores, electronics stores, furniture stores, large-format and warehouse stores, smaller specialty retailers and independent bike dealers.

We offer programs that provide price discounts to our Retail customers for ordering container-sized shipments or placing orders early enough in our manufacturing season to allow for more efficient manufacturing by our Asian suppliers. These programs are designed to reduce our shipping and handling costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. In addition, we often offer other types of sales incentives to our Retail customers, including volume discounts and various forms of rebates or allowances, which generally are intended to increase product exposure and availability for consumers, reduce transportation costs, and encourage marketing and promotion of our brands or specific products.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND INNOVATION 
Innovation is a vital part of our business, and we continue to expand and diversify our product offerings by leveraging our research and development capabilities. We constantly search for new technologies and innovations that will help us grow our business, either through higher sales or increased production efficiencies. To accomplish this objective, we seek out ideas and concepts both within our company and from outside inventors. Recently, our investments have been focused on personalized connected-fitness, including voice coaching, simulated outdoor exploration and diverse music playlist options with copyright clearance. Our JRNY® digital platform uses artificial intelligence and data from an initial assessment and every following workout to create, and continually evolve, personalized daily workouts based on the user's fitness goals and capabilities. Our data shows the JRNY® system is coaching people to work out longer and getting them to stay with their fitness journey longer.
We rely on financial and engineering models to assist us in assessing the potential operational and economic impacts of adopting new technologies and innovations. If we determine that a third-party technology or innovation concept meets certain technical and financial criteria, we may enter into a licensing arrangement to utilize the technology or, in certain circumstances, purchase the technology for our own use. Our product design and engineering teams also invest considerable effort to improve product design and quality. As a consumer-driven company, we invest in qualitative and quantitative consumer research to help us assess new product concepts, optimal features and anticipated consumer adoption.
Our research and development expenses were $22.8 million, $3.8 million, $15.8 million and $14.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2022, the three-month transition period ended March 31, 2021, and years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our research and development expenses in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to increased expenses related to personnel to develop and update our connected-fitness technology. The increase in our research and development expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increased capitalized investment for our connected-fitness technology. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in fiscal 2023 as we continue to supplement our investment in new product development, technology initiatives, and engineering capabilities.
JRNY® Digital Platform
JRNY® Member
JRNY® Members are offered Connected Fitness Subscriptions on a month-to-month or annual basis, that allow for multiple household users, and provide unlimited access to on-demand classes and fitness experiences. Our JRNY® digital platform allows Members and Subscribers to access digital content through JRNY® and track performance metrics and goals. Our Members gain access to our content through our digital app JRNY®, which is available through iOS and Android mobile devices and most tablets and computers.
We define JRNY® Members as all individuals who have a JRNY® account and/or Subscription, which includes Subscribers, their respective associated users and users who consume free content. We had approximately 325,000 JRNY® Members as of March 31, 2022.
Subscriptions
We define Subscriptions as a person or household who paid for a Subscription (via a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers), or are in a trial, or have requested a "pause"' to their subscriptions for up to three months. As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 111,000 Subscriptions.

SEASONALITY
We expect our revenue from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally. Sales are typically strongest in our fiscal third quarter ending December and fourth quarter ending March and are generally weakest in our fiscal first quarter ending June and second quarter ending September. We believe that consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities during the spring and summer months, including outdoor exercise, which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment. This seasonality can have a significant effect on our inventory levels, working capital needs and resource utilization.
MERCHANDISE SOURCING
All of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, and our manufacturing partners are primarily located in Asia. Although multiple factories bid on and are able to produce most of our products, we typically select one factory to be the primary supplier of any given product. Lead times for inventory purchases from our Asian suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately two to three months, of which transit time represents three to four weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand for our products. We attempt to compensate for our long replenishment lead times by maintaining adequate levels of inventory at our warehousing facilities.
We monitor our suppliers' ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce adherence to our quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration and our manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure our products from other sources at our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of raw materials and producing parts and finished products to our specifications.
LOGISTICS
Our company-operated warehousing and distribution facilities are located in Oregon, Ohio and California. In addition to company-operated distribution centers, we utilize third-party warehouses and logistics providers to fulfill orders. 
In our Direct business, we strive to maintain inventory levels that will allow us to ship our products shortly after receiving a customer's order. We use common carriers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments to Direct customers.
In our Retail business, we manage our inventory levels to accommodate anticipated seasonal changes in demand. Generally, we maintain higher inventory levels at the end of the fiscal second and third quarters to satisfy relatively higher consumer demand in the fiscal third and fourth quarters of each year. Many of our Retail customers place orders well in advance of peak periods of consumer demand to ensure an adequate supply for the anticipated selling season. 
In fiscal 2022, approximately 60% of our Retail customers' orders were shipped by our contract manufacturers in Asia directly to our Retail customers' locations, typically in container loads. The use of such direct shipments allows us to maintain lower levels of inventory in our warehouses, resulting in lower storage, handling, freight, insurance and other costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. We use various commercial truck lines for our merchandise shipments to Retail customers.
COMPETITION
The markets for all of our products are highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business are quality, brand recognition, innovation and pricing. We believe we are well positioned to compete in markets in which we can take advantage of our strong brand names and that our focus on innovative product design, quality, and our integrated fitness experiences distinguishes our products from our competition.
Our products compete directly with those offered by a large number of companies that market consumer fitness experiences and programs. As more retailers utilize eCommerce, our competitors have become increasingly similar across our Direct and Retail segments.
Table of Contents

Our principal competitors include: Peloton, iFit Health & Fitness Inc. ("iFit"), Johnson Health Tech, Technogym, Echelon, Mirror, Hydrow, Tonal, JaxJox and Tempo. We also compete with marketers of mobile device applications focused on fitness training and coaching on both iOS® and Android™ platforms, for example Peloton, Zwift, Strava, Mirror, BeachBody, and Apple Fitness+. Additional marketers of competitive products include in-studio fitness classes, fitness clubs, at-home fitness equipment and content, and health and wellness apps.
EMPLOYEES
At Nautilus, we promote an overall alignment of our Mission, Vision, and Values. This includes a strategy to create a company culture that attracts talent and provides retention, promotes employee engagement and wellness while ensuring equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion. There is a focus on workforce compensation and equity for our employees. In our efforts to build a healthier world, one person at a time, we strive to make a positive impact on the global fitness industry, our community, and our planet with a commitment to operate with transparent, socially conscious, and sustainable business practices.
As of June 1, 2022, we had 521 employees, 4 of whom were part-time. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a material interruption of our operations due to labor disputes. 
Company culture
Nautilus's culture is as unique as its employees and can be seen and felt throughout the Company. It is an inclusive environment, which helps individuals become their best selves, unlocking the greatest potential of each person to go 'above and beyond' for success. We value partnerships with businesses, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations to service our community. Our charitable contributions focus on supporting these partnerships and serving the community. We are engaged citizens in the communities in which we operate and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion extends to the way we support these communities.
Employee engagement and wellness
At Nautilus, we are committed to developing and maintaining a positive company culture that attracts and retains talent, engages with employees, and promotes wellness, while ensuring diversity, equity, and inclusion for all employees. Every member of Team Nautilus brings a unique background and skills to our company. We celebrate our differences but we are united in our Mission, Vision, and Values. We are a dynamic team driving the future of consumer fitness experiences through our well-known brands and a passionate company culture.
We conduct surveys on a monthly basis and analyze the results, provide feedback to employees of those results, and, where appropriate, develop initiatives around issues raised by employees. Nautilus also supports learning and development opportunities, implementation of health and safety measures and other employee wellness programs. 
Nautilus pivoted overnight from the onset of COVID-19 into a fully remote environment. As the pandemic continued, numerous efforts and careful decisions were made by the Executive Team, considering employee input, to maintain the highest level of health and safety of employees and their families. Remote work continued until safety precautions were lifted, and employees could safely return to an office environment. The flexibility and ability to adjust to change continues, as we settle into a hybrid schedule, allowing collaboration and interaction while showing the continued commitment and flexibility to this ever-changing environment. Managers are being provided training to develop skills for success in this hybrid transition.
Talent acquisition and retention
We believe that the retention of our talented people is a key element to our ability to execute our strategy. Our ability to retain our talent has become increasingly challenging in a competitive labor market as reflected in what has been coined “The Great Resignation”. In addition to our competitive compensation program, we have instituted a number of initiatives for open communication between leaders and employees to ensure that management is able to respond continuously and strategically to employee needs and concerns. We believe that open and continuous dialogue fosters a dynamic culture of ownership and accountability at all levels.
We have a comprehensive and holistic approach to ensuring that we have the best people with exceptional and diverse skills and perspectives who are engaged and can grow to execute our strategy in a continuously changing environment. Our talent philosophy includes hiring from a diverse pool of candidates, developing our internal talent with formal and informal training opportunities, engaging our people with our company culture, and retaining our talent with competitive rewards and promoting our well-qualified and diverse pipeline of leaders.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Trademarks, patents and other forms of intellectual property are vital to the success of our business and are an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry. We regularly monitor commercial activity in our industry to identify potential infringement of our intellectual property. We protect our proprietary rights and attempt to take prompt, reasonable actions to prevent counterfeit products and other infringement on our intellectual property.
Trademarks
We own many trademarks, including Nautilus®, Bowflex®, Max Trainer®, TreadClimber®, Power Rod®, Bowflex Revolution®, SelectTech®, Airdyne®, Max Total®, Explore the World®, VeloCore® and JRNY®. Nautilus is the exclusive licensee under the Schwinn® mark for indoor fitness products. We believe that having distinctive trademarks that are readily identifiable by consumers is an important factor in creating a market for our products, maintaining a strong company identity and developing brand loyalty among our customers. In addition, we have granted licenses to a third party to use the Nautilus®, Schwinn® and TreadClimber® trademarks on commercial fitness products, for which we receive royalty income and expanded consumer awareness of our brands.
Each federally registered trademark is renewable indefinitely if the trademark is still in use at the time of renewal.
Patents and Designs
Building our intellectual property portfolio is an important factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness equipment industry. We have followed a policy of filing applications for U.S. and non-U.S. patents on utility and design inventions that we deem valuable to our business.
We own or license patents and design registrations covering a variety of technologies, some of which are utilized in our dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, treadmills, exercise bikes, and elliptical machines. Patent and design protection for these technologies, which are utilized in products sold in both the Direct and Retail segments, extends as far as 2045.
We maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to our Max Trainer® specialized cardio machines, which are sold in our Direct and Retail segments. The portfolio includes issued patents with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2037, and additional pending patent applications.
We maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to our JRNY® digital fitness platform. The portfolio includes issued patents with expiration dates ranging from 2032 to 2038, and additional pending patent applications.
Nautilus is the licensee of a patent related to the Bowflex Revolution® home gyms and patents related to the VeloCore® bike. The home gym patent expires in 2025, and the bike patents have expiration dates in 2027.
BACKLOG
We define our customer order backlog to include firm orders for future shipment to our Retail customers, as well as unfulfilled consumer orders within the Direct segment.
Backlog as of a given date fluctuates based on specific timing of product shipment within the typical shipment timeframes for each of our segments. We had $32.9 million in backlog as of March 31, 2022. Our customer order backlog as of March 31, 2021 was approximately $205.1 million due to global supply and logistics disruptions during the COVID pandemic.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
At Nautilus, we understand that environmental sustainability is a critical component of our business strategy and to the world in general. While we comply in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations and laws at our U.S. locations and internationally, we have been and will continue to evaluate our environmental impact and initiate improvements internally and with our third-party partners. By aligning sustainability initiatives throughout our operations, supply chain and product lifecycle, we continue to develop ourselves and our programs to improve resource efficiency and reduce waste
We will continue to build our environmental initiatives, ensuring that we have the information, systems, people, and processes in place across the organization to develop targets and roadmaps for priority focus areas. We will integrate and accelerate to make tangible progress and further embed sustainability across our full value chain. Some areas of focus include a lower carbon footprint, less landfill waste, chemical safety and regulatory compliance.
We do not expect that environmental legislation will have an adverse effect on our financial condition, nor do we anticipate any impact to material costs or liabilities in connection with environmental matters. Our goal is to initiate proactive measures and mitigate any possible risk in association with our environmental efforts.
Our digital platforms may receive, process, transmit and store personal health and fitness information relating to identifiable individuals. Consumer demand for personalized fitness experiences, through mobile applications or wearable fitness trackers and our focus on digital fitness solutions for our products may increase the volume of identifiable individual information we receive on our platforms and through our products. We also receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals in our capacity as an employer. As a result, we may be subject to numerous United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect both individually identifiable information as well as personal health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), each of which governs, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. The GDPR includes, and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted, consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and include jurisdiction-specific obligations.
We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and our controls in place are adequate for our continued compliance.
