BUSINESS UNITS
 

1) | Tracking and Monitoring Technology - Our SmartSole line of wearable footwear technology is designed for people with cognitive memory disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, and traumatic brain injury (“TBI”). Approximately 9 million people in the U.S. and over 100 million worldwide expected to reach 277 million by 2050 fall under this umbrella of people with cognitive disorders. Typically, these people tend to wander and require some wander guard technology and remote oversight. The SmartSoles are comfortable orthotic insoles embedded with a GPS and cellular tracking module, so that a caregiver can know in real time where a loved one is at the touch of a button from any smartphone or computer. The Company also leverages its technology platform for use in high value asset tracking such as drones, small light weight cargo, and other high value mobile assets that require a robust, small footprint and low power consumption hardware and software platform. GTX has been working on expanding this unit to include Short Range and Logistics tracking, utilizing BLE and NFC technology for tracking valuable assets across the supply chain, such as expensive clothing, wines, foods, or pharmaceuticals. BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC – Near Field Communication are a short-range wireless protocol that triggers data exchange from one device to another. The chip is about the size of a nickel and can be attached, embedded, sewn, glued, embroidered, and even ironed on or otherwise affixed to just about any person or product, including print materials, packaging, and wearables.

2) | Medical Supplies – In 2020 the Company expanded its product line from medical devices to high quality Health & Safety protective equipment and supplies, ranging from hearing assisted technology to masks, sanitizing equipment, UV sterilization equipment, and rapid test kits. With many of its products made or sourced in the U.S. 
3) | IP and Technology licensing- many of our patents were issued over the past 10 years and we continue to add new patents to our portfolio, and as GPS and wearable technology becomes more ubiquitous and used in numerous products, the GTX intellectual property portfolio is garnering interest within the tech community. GTX is currently engaged in a licensing and monetization campaign. Over 150 companies that could potentially license some or all our IP have been identified and so far, the Company has signed 14 licensing agreements and generated over $1 million dollars in license fees. 

CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
Management’s corporate strategy is to continue to build and grow GTX as a health & safety medical and wearable technology company that provides turnkey solutions for the consumer, enterprise, and government. Most of the GTX tracking and monitoring products are sold with a monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription service plan or licensing fees ranging from $2.00 to $35.00, per month per monitored asset. In addition to product sales and recurring subscription fees, the Company also generates revenues through software and IP licensing. Many of our patents have filing dates going back to 2004, 2005 and 2006, have ongoing open continuations, with many of patent claims being used in the marketplace today, providing and opportunity for the Company to license its IP to other technology companies. Part of our strategy is to identify new companies or existing companies that launch new products that are a potential licensee candidate.

As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are focused on launching new medical and tracking wearable products, either internally developed or acquired through licensing, that stand alone or can be part of our SmartSole platform that help grow our subscriber base or increase our average revenue per subscriber. New product development can lead to new IP, hence strengthening our IP portfolio creating additional licensing opportunities. Collectively this approach feeds on one another whereby we can build steady recurring revenue streams. Launching new products, new vertical sales channels and building out our patent portfolio are the key drivers for growth. The more products we develop and sell, the more subscribers we bring onboard. And, as our patent portfolio grows and evolves, so do our licensing opportunities. To date we have built a network of strategic global partners, a robust technology platform of proprietary hardware and software and a growing intellectual property (IP) portfolio. The GTX product lines of embedded smart wearable GPS devices, Stand-Alone GPS devices, Digital Apps, BLE/NFC solution, encrypted RF military personnel and asset tracking solutions and protective medical supplies and devices are sold direct to the consumer (“B2C”), to the enterprise business to business (“B2B”), and to local, state, federal and international government agencies , through our network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, non-profit organizations, military and police departments, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been ramping up its product distribution and sales channels and, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had live units in the field and / or paying subscribers in over 40 countries, with customers and distributors in Canada, Mexico, Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. In the U.S. the Company sells direct to the consumer through its online ecommerce platform, a host of retailers and resellers along with hundreds of online affiliates. The Company also manages direct B2B enterprise and government sales through its business development team and advisors. The B2B initiatives comprise of supporting existing distributors along with bringing on new distributors, working with U.S. and Foreign agencies, to support existing business and secure new business, and domestically to work with local, state, and federal agencies to acquire reimbursement codes for its line of SmartSoles. To date GTX has been issued a vendor number for reimbursement in 11 U.S. states and internationally in Canada, Norway, Sweden and in the U.K. the National Health Services (“NHS”) began conducting regional pilots for the wander assistive GPS SmartSoles, in urban centers with high populations of seniors afflicted with dementia. Under these reimbursement programs, the SmartSoles are either partially (50% to 60%) or sometimes up to (100% including the monthly subscriptions) paid for or subsidized by the local, state, or federal grants or through insurance reimbursement. As additional resources become available, we plan to apply for new grants and private insurance reimbursement along with other health and municipal services both domestically and in other countries. Where granted, the subsidies lower the cost of buying and owning our tracking products, which can result in an increase in customers and revenues.
 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
Smart wearable technology is becoming ubiquitous, and it is starting to find its way into all parts of the global society. Miniature electronic devices that are worn by a person, commonly referred to as wearables, are continuing a strong upward trajectory evident by the likes of Nike, Garmin, Google, Samsung, Apple, Verizon and a host of other fortune 100 companies that have entered into this space. Wearable Technology is on the rise in personal fitness, wellness, healthcare, and business use. CCS Insight (a provider of market information, data analysis and market intelligence) recently updated its outlook on the future of wearable tech, indicating that 411 million smart wearable devices, worth a staggering $34 billion, were be sold in 2020.
 
Location-Based Services (LBS) and Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), published by Markets and Markets, are expected to grow from USD 16.0 billion in 2019 to USD 40.0 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 20.1%. This growth will be fueled because it is now possible for a network of physical objects (humans, vehicles, buildings, infrastructure, equipment of all shapes and types) to collect and exchange data and to communicate and work together. This enables devices, sensors and systems to operate autonomously in pursuit of goals and objectives set by the human architects of the system. We believe that accurately identifying the location of a person or assets in real time will be a key driver in many applications for the consumer, enterprise, and government sectors.

The Caregiving Innovation Frontiers (“CIF”) study by the Longevity Network, used analysis and research from Parks Associates found that an estimated 117 million Americans will need assistance of some kind by 2022, but the number of unpaid caregivers is only expected to reach 45 million in the same year. This demand represents a $279 billion revenue opportunity over the coming years across six different business areas identified in the study, with 80% of spending being out-of-pocket costs. Technology solutions and remote health monitoring systems that enable family caregivers to monitor the location of elderly persons could provide key relief, according to the report. The CIF report outlined six areas for business opportunities, with huge potential for revenue grabs. Technology represents an opportunity across all the service areas, according to the Association of American Retired Persons (AARP). Most family caregivers (67% of them) want to use technology to monitor their loved one’s health and safety, but only about 10% are doing so right now, leaving a lot of room for growth.
 
In our ever-mobile society, it helps to know where we are and where we are going. Same with caregivers of seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia, freight forwarding companies wanting to know where their packages are, and employers wanting to know where their field workers are. Many parents desire to have the ability to know where their children are and where they are going. Having such information is now possible with access to real-time information delivered on-demand through miniaturized, low power consumption locator systems and technologies such as ours.
 
The rising need for real-time location systems (RTLS) and wearable location-based services (LBS) is influenced by several factors, among them:
 

● | Universal awareness and expanding penetration of GPS enabled mobile smartphones & tablets (estimated 2 billion devices). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personal and asset security concerns affecting a greater portion of the population. This includes the increased awareness related to global terrorism, active shootings, natural disasters, and general unrest. 
● | Increasing numbers of elderly or memory impaired (Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, etc. approximately 9 million in U.S. and according to the World Health Organization who estimates that Alzheimer’s will reach 135 million worldwide by 2050). 
● | Corporations needing to manage worker productivity, efficiency, and logistics. 
● | Government agencies, law enforcement and military need to track personnel and assets. 
● | Massive lifestyle adoption of location-based advertising and social networking. 

 
GTX Management believes that more and more consumers, enterprises, and government agencies are realizing the importance of using tracking and monitoring information technology. The technology growth story has long focused on the consumer, but as enterprises in every industry sector, including the government sector, look to technology to facilitate and transform their own operations, the opportunities for technology companies have broadened considerably. The following information illustrates the ways in which various tech markets are expected to grow.
 
The LBS and RTLS market have grown considerably over the past few years and is expected to grow further with increasing portable personal digital assistant (“PDA”) based e-commerce. The overall market is expected to grow from $15.04 billion in 2016 to $77.84 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 38.9%.

INTELECTUAL PROPERTY
 
GTX’s IP portfolio not only supports the Company’s core product lines by creating barriers of entry to competitors, but also underscores the Company’s intrinsic value and generates revenues from out bound licensing. Our early investment in IP dates to 2002 and demonstrates GTX’s commitment to developing innovative technology in the growing wearable GPS, LBS and RTLS space. The GTX IP portfolio underpins its business and provides support across all its business units. The portfolio addresses three core areas: Footwear, Communication and International coverage and as of December 31, 2021 we had twenty-two (22) patents and several trademark registrations. These include eighteen (18) issued U.S. utility patents, three of which are insole patents, two (2) issued U.S. design patents, and two (2) other pending U.S. utility patent applications. We also have two (2) issued Mexican utility patents and one (1) pending European foreign national patent application based on our U.S. filings. In addition to the five (5) comm protocol’s (program-to-program communications access methods), which falls under GTX U.S. Patent 8,760,286, commonly referred to as the 286 GTX patent family, GTX also has several patents on the device side. The international multi- pronged IP protection approach is part of the overall intellectual property strategy protecting all aspects of the GTX enterprise and value of its hardware and platform
 
GTX also has under license one (1) U.S. patent and twelve (12) foreign patents. Included under the IP portfolio GTX has U.S. trademark registrations including, but not limited to, registrations for the marks “LOCi” and “LOCIMOBILE.” In addition, another U.S. trademark application for “GPS SMART SOLE SATELLITE MONITORING AND REALTIME TRACKING”, “GTX CORP”, and “WITH YOU.”
 
As part of our outbound IP licensing monetization campaign in June 2016 we signed a revenue share monetization agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC (“Inventergy”), a subsidiary of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT), the first licensing agreement was signed for the monetization campaign was signed in the first quarter of 2019, with last settlement in fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to December 13, 2021, when we terminated our agreement with Inventergy by not renewing their license, we had signed 14 settlements valued at approximately $250,000 in licensing fees, which represented less than what was expected in the original agreement, which led both parties to mutually dissolve the partnership.
 
Due to Covid and other resource related circumstances the GTX IP campaign stalled during 2021 and after several months of analysis on how to revamp the campaign it was mutually agreed by the BOD of Inventergy and GTX, that GTX should take back full control of its patents and the licensing strategy. Effective November 20, 2021, GTX dissolved its patent license agreement with Inventergy, LLC whereby Inventergy transferred and assigned back to GTX all rights, title and interest in each of the Patents, consistent with what was specified in Section 4.1 of the original agreement, including all (sole) responsibility for future prosecution and maintenance of the Patents, including any rights to receive any further royalties, compensation, revenue share for any past present or future monetization effort, effectively relinquishing its fifty-five (55%) ownership interest, back to GTX. Subsequently in December of 2021 the USPTO granted a notice of allowance on a patent application which covers different aspects of the GPS SmartSole product, and we expect to receive more patents covering other aspects on related applications in the future as we continue to expand our IP portfolio in the wearable technology space, especially as the global wearable medical device market continues to grow and expecting to reach $9.4 billion by 2022. This 4th patent helps solidify our portfolio with respect to wearable tracking and monitoring technologies embedded in footwear. That came on the heels of another office action from the USPT on our com protocol family of patents which allowed an additional Patent which now GTX has filed ongoing open continuations for both patents which we expect will further enhance the portfolio and strengthen our licensing strategy.
 
TECHNOLOGY
 
GTX has developed a “carrier-class” architecture and no longer needs to host the servers in a facility Data Center. Throughout 2020 most of our servers were migrated to the cloud which enables cost-efficient expansion, without the need for application code changes.
 
Our current location tracking product design utilizes quad-band GSM/GPRS telephony chip sets and can be adapted to the prevalent GSM/GPRS wireless technologies. Our modules utilize advanced “weak signal server-enhanced” technology which provide rapid location identification. Each module is programmed with a unique identification number and uses standard cellular frequencies to communicate its location. The module is also programmed with a unique subscriber identification number allowing each owner to subscribe to different services.

We continue to modify and upgrade our modules for our SmartSoles and other GPS tracking products. The production and roll-out of version 4 of our SmartSole product is expected to be a benefit because, unlike the earlier versions, we will no longer have to custom make SmartSoles for our international distributors, so our manufacturing cost and timelines are reduced, and we have more flexibility to timely meet our customers’ requirements. Also, we now can bill for data charges in over 100 countries, thereby increasing our potential markets. The ability to produce a product that can be delivered to foreign market without customization and to bill for data charges in additional countries will enable us to increase our RPS (revenue per subscriber). Our core tracking products (SmartSole, Take-Along-Tracker, OEM modules and Track my Work Force App) are supported by the existing infrastructure for the worldwide cell network that provides coverage throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and numerous other countries that operate on the global GSM Wireless networks. Our personal locator modules have the ability to operate on the networks of 290 carriers in over 210 countries.
 
STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS and LICENSING
 
We offer location-based hardware and/or IoT data monitoring platform to third parties for the sale and distribution of location-based products/services in various vertical markets. We begin the process by entering into a platform test agreement or pilot program with a potential partner with the intent to transition into a long-term relationship. By establishing and building partnerships, through licensing agreements, OEM, and carrier relationships, we facilitate efficient entry into new markets leveraging each third parties core competencies. We enhance the value of our distribution channels by aligning our sales and marketing efforts with strategic partners, including co-branding, distribution and marketing with telecommunication companies, wireless carriers, national retailers and major consumer branded companies. We can customize our products into different form factors for the specific needs of customers. To date, the Company has created custom solutions for the monitoring of seniors with cognitive memory disorders by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and insoles; the monitoring of children by installing the GPS device into specially designed toys, belts, insoles and backpacks; and the monitoring of various high value assets such as drones, long guns and other mobile assets.
 
The Company has several key strategic relationships established both on the supply side and the distribution side. Some of the key partners on the supply side are Atlantic Footcare (which manufactures our SmartSoles), Spline (our engineering firm), Nordic (which manufactures our GPS and Cellular electronics) and Telefonica (which provides our global connectivity). On the distribution side, we have numerous partnerships worldwide, ranging from distributors, health organizations, and retailers.
 
RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT
 
As an emerging tech company our long-term growth is predicated on making investments in R&D and Intellectual Property. This year we took the opportunity to invest in our future, by ramping up NFC, BLE and 4G development projects. We are integrating our NFC tags with Blockchain technology and started developing a secured, scalable middleware layer that sits in-between our NFC devices and third-party backend platforms. We started working with several partners that provide various vertical specific Block chain, IoT and AI backend platforms but needed a secure and seamless flow of data from hardware to backend. This middleware lawyer is industry agnostic and is designed to help drive NFC hardware business and other IoT device sales. We also continued testing our Near Field Communication (NFC) Temperature Trackers, which provide real-time temperature sensing and data logging across the supply chain necessary with transportation of perishables; food, drinks, pharmaceuticals, and other temperature sensitive products that can be negatively affected by conditions in transit. This is still a new business silo that has not begun generating revenue, but we see this new technology as a natural extension into the world of asset tracking, taking us beyond humans to tracking and monitoring of perishable shipments of food, beverages, biopharmaceuticals, live organs and many other temperature sensitive shipments. In addition to temperature sensing we are now looking into NFC tags that can authenticate products, addressing the multibillion dollar worldwide counterfeit market.
GROWTH STRATEGY
 
We have developed a multi-prong business model approach; business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), Government and Military sales, and licensing of our technology and IP. We have successfully proven out all our models in a small scale. With B2C, we continue to invest in e-commerce and once we can hit critical mass with lower pricing, we will expand into the mass consumer markets. With B2B our strategy is to establish more partners and relationships with key industry leaders who will embed our technology into their products to sell to their established customer base. In addition, we plan to continue working with the Military both in the U.S. and abroad. Lastly, we plan to continue to identify companies that can license our IP. This approach requires time and capital to grow, however it is also diversified so that all our eggs are not in one basket and once scaled can show rapid growth. As a growing underfinanced company, we have managed to prove out our business models and now need to scale. Management believes that once we have the resources to scale any of these models or all of them, we can expect to see steady and sustainable growth. We are actively raising capital to meet our growth strategies through an Offering Statement on Form 1-A, filed on October 15, 2021 and qualified on October 27, 2021.

COMPETITION
 
Personal location and asset tracking devices of various kinds are currently available from numerous vendors, and the number of competitive products is increasing rapidly in the marketplace. Furthermore, many of the location products and services are available at no cost to the user or are already included in other products. Nevertheless, we believe this rapidly growing market acceptance of the tracking solutions that we offer represents an opportunity as the intrinsic value of the tracking solutions is recognized and mass market adoption continues. The key competitive advantage for GTX in its lead SmartSole product is our innovative approach to embedding electronics inside a flexible footwear system, which advantage is protected by an extensive patent portfolio and first to market. Another key competitive advantage is our large and growing patent portfolio along with our ability, because we are a small company, to be agile and responsive while still having deep and long industry knowledge of the GPS space.
 
Key differentiators between ourselves and the competition is:
 
B2B:
 

● | Providing a comprehensive fully integrated, patented end-to-end solution comprised of hardware, software, and global connectivity, that can be embedded or OEM into other companies’ product lines. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Being small and nimble we can provide faster turnaround times and lower pricing, which has been a key advantage in our military business. 

 
B2C:
 

● | Our BLE & GPS SmartSole is the only non-visible, non-intrusive tracking and monitoring solution.

There are numerous competitors for GPS products in general, and for our LOCiMOBILE® smart phone applications, including Location Based Technologies, Inc., Google Latitude, Foursquare, Trimble Navigation, Inc., Brick House Security, Verizon, and Trackimo, Inc. Many of our competitors are better financed than we are and/or have greater marketing and scientific resources than we can provide. We are also aware of a number of domestic and foreign competitors that offer much lower quality products in order to gain market share. The U.S. Government systems integration business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change due to new requirements and budget allocation. We compete with many military suppliers and other large and diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. Government market. Many of the existing and potential competitors have greater financial, operating, and technological resources than we have. The competitive environment may require us to make changes in our pricing, services, or marketing. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded, but for which we do not receive meaningful revenues. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. In the government services sector, our competition includes large systems integrators and defense contractors. Some of these competitors include global defense and IT service companies such as, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. However so far being small and nibble along with our ability to deliver product and services, quickly, at a fair market price and customize products on demand, have been to our advantage, over many larger competitors.
