 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
  Form and Year of Organization
 
 American Bio Medica Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 2, 1986 under the laws of the State of New York under the name American Micro Media, Inc. On September 9, 1992, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to American Bio Medica Corporation.
 Our Business
 
 We manufacture and sell lateral flow immunoassay tests, primarily for the immediate detection of certain drugs in urine and oral fluids at the point of collection. Our products are accurate, self-contained, cost-effective, user-friendly products that are capable of accurately identifying the presence or absence of drugs in a sample within minutes. Our products are used by pain management and drug treatment facilities, laboratory professionals, law enforcement and other government personnel, as well as by employers and education professionals.
 
 In addition to the manufacture and sale of drug testing products, we provide bulk test strip manufacturing services to unaffiliated third parties on a contract basis. We do not currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from bulk test strip contract manufacturing.
 
  Our Products
 
  Products for the Detection of Drugs in Urine
 
 We manufacture a number of products that detect the presence or absence of certain drugs in urine. We offer a number of standard configurations, custom configurations on special order, and different cut-off levels for certain drugs. Cut-off levels are concentrations of drugs or metabolites that must be present in urine (or oral fluid) specimens before a positive result will be obtained. Our urine drugs tests are either 510(k) cleared. CLIA Waived and/or OTC cleared (see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests). Our urine drug tests can detect the following drugs:
 
 Rapid Drug Screen®: The Rapid Drug Screen, or RDS®, is a patented rapid drug test that detects the presence or absence of 2 to 10 drugs simultaneously in a single urine specimen. The RDS is available as a card only, or as part of a kit that includes a patented collection cup.
 
 Rapid ONE®: The Rapid ONE product line consists of single drug tests, each of which tests for the presence or absence of a single drug in a urine specimen. The Rapid ONE is designed for those situations in which a person is known to use a specific drug. It can also be used with a RDS to allow screening of an additional drug. The Rapid ONE is currently sold in very limited markets; primarily markets outside of the United States.
 
 RDS InCup®: The patented RDS InCup is a drug-testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 12 drugs in a urine specimen. The RDS InCup incorporates collection and testing of a urine sample in a single step. Each RDS InCup product contains multiple channels, and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect a single drug.

 Rapid TOX®: Rapid TOX is a cost-effective drug test in a cassette platform that simultaneously detects the presence or absence of 2 to 10 drugs in a urine specimen. Each Rapid TOX contains one or two channels, and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect more than one drug.
 
 Rapid TOX Cup® II: The patented Rapid TOX Cup II is another drug testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 14 drugs in a urine specimen. The Rapid TOX Cup II also incorporates collection and testing of the urine sample in a single step. Each Rapid TOX Cup II contains multiple channels and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect more than one drug.
 
 Rapid TOX Cup II (2G): In early 2015, we launched a second generation of the original Rapid TOX Cup II. The second generation consists of a smaller cup with smaller test strips. This smaller version results in lower material costs and allows us to be more cost competitive against foreign manufactured products.
 
  Private Label Products
 
 We do provide a private labeled version of Rapid TOX to unaffiliated third parties for sale outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, sales of these products were not material.
 
  Products for the Detection of Drugs in Oral Fluid:
 
 We manufacture drug tests that detect the presence or absence of drugs in oral fluids. These products are easy to use and provide test results within minutes with enhanced sensitivity and detection. Our oral fluid drug tests are currently marketed “for forensic use only” (see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests). We currently offer the following oral fluid drug tests:
 
 OralStat®: OralStat is a patented and patent pending, innovative drug test for the detection of drugs in oral fluids. Each OralStat simultaneously tests for 6 or 10 drugs in an oral fluid specimen.
 
  Private Label Products
 
 We do provide a private labeled version of our OralStat product to unaffiliated third parties for sale outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, sales of these products were not material.
 Other Products
 
 We distribute a number of other products related to the detection of substances of abuse. We do not manufacture these products. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of these products.
 Contract Manufacturing
 
 We provide bulk test strip contract manufacturing services to non-affiliated diagnostic companies. In the year ended December 31, 2017 (“Fiscal 2017”), we manufactured a test for the detection of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus; the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide), and strip components for a test to detect fetal amniotic membrane rupture. In Fiscal 2017, a manufacturing change with one of our contract manufacturing customers contributed to the decline in revenue.
 Our Markets
 
  Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment
 
 The Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment market includes people in both inpatient and outpatient treatment for substance abuse. Drug testing is a positive aspect of treatment as it aids in relapse prevention and encourages honesty both within the patient and with outside interactions. In addition, being able to accurately gauge the current drug use by patients enrolled in a substance abuse program is essential so, urine drug testing is an integral part of treatment programs, including physician office-based programs. There is typically a high frequency of testing in this market. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.

  Pain Management
 
 Drug testing in pain management is one of the major tools of adherence monitoring in the assessment of a patient’s predisposition to, and patterns of, misuse/abuse; a vital first step towards establishing and maintaining the safe and effective use of drugs in the treatment of chronic pain. There are many benefits of using an ABMC drug test; these include reducing the risk for toxicity in patients vulnerable to adverse drug effects, detecting patient non-compliance, reducing the risk of therapeutic failure, and avoiding or detecting drug-drug interaction. Additionally, drug testing enhances the physician’s ability to use drugs effectively and minimize costs. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.
 Other Clinical
 
 Other Clinical markets include emergency rooms/hospitals, family physician offices and laboratories. There are a number of medical emergencies associated with adverse reactions, accidental drug ingestions, and misuse or abuse of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications. To address this issue, drug testing is performed so healthcare professionals are able to ascertain the drug status of a patient before they administer pharmaceuticals or other treatment. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors. We also have a long-term relationship with one of the world’s largest clinical laboratories.
 
  Government (including law enforcement and criminal justice)
 
 The Government market includes federal, state, county and local agencies, including police departments, adult and juvenile correctional facilities, pretrial agencies, probation, drug courts and parole departments at the federal and state levels. A significant number of individuals on parole or probation, or within federal, state, county and local correctional facilities and jails, have one or more conditions to their sentence, including but not limited to, periodic drug-testing and substance abuse treatment. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force.
 
  Employment/Workplace
 
 The Workplace market consists of pre-employment testing of job applicants, as well as random, cause and post-accident testing of employees. Many employers recognize the financial and safety benefits of implementing drug-free workplace programs, of which drug testing is an integral part. In some states, there are workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance premium reductions, tax deductions and other incentives for adopting these programs. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force and through a select network of distributors.
 
  International
 
 The International market consists of various markets outside of the United States. Although workplace testing is not as prevalent outside of the United States as within, the international Government and Clinical markets are somewhat in concert with their United States counterparts. One market that is significantly more prevalent outside of the United States is roadside drug testing. We sell in this market through a select network of distributors.
 Our Distribution Method
 
 We have a two-pronged distribution strategy that focuses on growing our business through direct sales and distributors. Our direct sales team consists of our Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Director of Clinical Sales, Director of Latin America Sales, Regional Sales Managers, sales consultants and Inside Sales Representatives (collectively our “Direct Sales Team”); all of which are trained professionals that are experienced in DOA testing sales. Our distributors are unaffiliated entities that resell our drug-testing products either as stand-alone products or as part of a service they provide to their customers.
 
 Our Direct Sales Team and network of distributors sell our products to the Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment, Pain Management, Other Clinical, Government and Employment/Workplace markets, and we sell through a network of distributors in the International market.
 
 We promote our products through direct mail campaigns, selected advertising, participation at high profile trade shows and other marketing activities.

  Competition
 
 We compete on the following factors:
 
 Pricing: The pricing structure in our markets is highly competitive. Price pressure is the greatest when comparing our pricing with pricing of products manufactured outside of the United States.
 
 Quality: Our products are manufactured, assembled and packaged completely in the United States in accordance with quality system regulations set forth by FDA; this includes the manufacturing of our drug test strips. Many companies in our industry claim their products are manufactured in the United States when in fact; their products are only assembled or packaged in the Unites States. The testing strips and in most cases the assembly of the product is done outside of the Unites States; usually in China. Products manufactured outside of the United States are generally manufactured outside of the requirements of quality system regulations set forth by FDA. In our opinion, this results in inferior, sub-par products being offered in the market. Most of our markets require accurate detection near the cut-off level of the test. Our products are manufactured to detect drug use closer to the cut-off level of the test. The majority of the drug tests on the market today are less aggressive; meaning they are not as sensitive and they will miss positive results. Missing positive results can be extremely troublesome to customers from both an economic and liability perspective.
 
 Customer and technical support: Our customers often need guidance and assistance with certain issues, including but not limited to, test administration, drug cross reactivity and drug metabolism. We provide our customers with continuous customer and technical support on a 24/7/365 basis; staffed by our employees. We believe that this support gives us a competitive advantage since our competitors do not offer this extended service to their customers.
 
  Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
 The primary raw materials required for the manufacture of our test strips and our drug tests consist of antibodies, antigens and other reagents, plastic molded pieces, membranes and packaging materials. We maintain an inventory of raw materials. Currently, most raw materials are available from several sources. We own the molds and tooling for our plastic components that are custom and proprietary. The ownership of these molds affords us flexibility and control in managing the supply chain for these components. We do not own the molds and tooling for plastic components that are “stock” items.
 Major Customers
 
 Two of our customers accounted for 35.1% and 14.6% of net sales in Fiscal 2017, and 30.9% and 15.5% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 (“Fiscal 2016”).
  
  Patents and Trademarks/Licenses
 
 As of December 31, 2017, we held 32 patents related to our point of collection drug-testing products, including 13 patents issued in the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we have 1 foreign patent application pending.
 
 As of December 31, 2017, we have 15 trademarks registered in the United States and, 10 trademarks registered in countries/regions such as Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
 
  Government Regulations
 
 In certain markets, the development, testing, manufacture and sale of our drug tests, and possible additional testing products for other substances or conditions, are subject to regulation by the United States and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and associated regulations, the FDA regulates the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. When a product is a medical device, a 510(k) marketing application must be submitted to the FDA. A 510(k) is a premarketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is safe and effective. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently being marketed in the United States. Most of our urine-based products are marketed and sold in the Clinical market (in addition to other markets) and therefore, we have obtained 510(k) marketing clearance, CLIA waiver (see below) and/or Over-The-Counter (OTC) marketing clearance on our urine based products. Our oral fluid products are not 510(k) cleared; however, we market and sell these products to the forensic market and for export outside the United States.

 In order to sell our products in Canada, we must comply with ISO 13485:2003, the International Standards Organization’s Directive for Quality Systems for Medical Devices (MDD or Medical Device Directive), and in order to sell our products in the European Union, we must obtain CE marking for our products (in the European Union, a “CE” mark is affixed to the product for easy identification of quality products). Collectively, these standards are similar to FDA regulations, and are a reasonable assurance to the customer that our products are manufactured in a consistent manner to help ensure that quality defect-free goods are produced. As of the date of this report, we have received approval and the right to bear the CE mark on our Rapid Drug Screen, Rapid ONE, Rapid TOX, RDS InCup, Rapid TOX Cup II, Rapid Reader and OralStat. We currently have the following Certificates of Registration in place: I.S. EN ISO 13485:2012, ISO 13485:2003 (CMDCAS) and I.S. EN ISO 9001:2008. All three of these registrations expire on July 31, 2018 (and we were re-audited in March 2018 to recertify. As of the date of this report, the audit is not yet complete.). We have also obtained the license to sell our RDS, Rapid ONE and Rapid TOX products in Canada through July 31, 2018.
 
 The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 established quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. As a result, those using CLIA waived tests are not subject to the more stringent and expensive requirements of moderate or high complexity laboratories. We have received CLIA waiver from the FDA related to our Rapid TOX product line and OTC clearance on our Rapid TOX Cup II (2G) product line (The OTC clearance of the Rapid TOX Cup II product line means they are CLIA waived products).
 
 Due to the nature of the manufacturing of our drug tests, the products we offer through contract manufacturing and the raw materials used for both, we do not incur any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws, nor do we experience any material effects of compliance with environmental laws.
 
  Research and Development (“R&D”)
 
 Our R&D efforts are continually focused on enhancing and/or maintaining the performance and reliability of our drug-testing products, developing new product platforms and exploring new drug assays to offer to our customers. Included in R&D expense are FDA compliance costs or costs associated with regulatory efforts taken related to the marketing of our products.
 
 Our R&D expenditures were $117,000 in Fiscal 2017 and, $184,000 in Fiscal 2016. None of the costs incurred in R&D in Fiscal 2017 or Fiscal 2016 were borne by a customer.
 
  Manufacturing and Employees
 
 Our facility in Kinderhook, New York houses assembly and packaging of our products, our warehouse and our administrative offices. We continue to primarily outsource the printing of the plastic components used in our products, and we outsource the manufacture of the plastic components used in our products. We manufacture our own individual test strips and we manufacture test strips for unaffiliated third parties at our R&D and bulk manufacturing facility in Logan Township, New Jersey. Unaffiliated third parties manufacture the adulteration, alcohol and certain forensic drug testing products we offer.
 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 53 employees, of which 51 were full-time and 2 were part-time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
