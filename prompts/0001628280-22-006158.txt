Integration of Marketing Services and SaaS
Our expertise in delivering solutions for our client base is rooted in our deep history of serving SMBs. We have worked for decades in our local communities, providing marketing solutions to SMBs. We found that SMBs need technology solutions to communicate with a large portion of consumers who now do business via their smartphones. We launched our SaaS business in 2015 to provide SMBs with the resources to compete for today’s mobile consumers. In 2021, SMB demand for integrated technology solutions continues to grow as SMBs adapt their business and service models to facilitate remote working and contact less customer interactions. We have seen this trend accelerate following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 onwards.
In 2021, domestically, we delivered more than 39 million PYP directories to strategically targeted American homes whose demographics indicate a higher propensity to use print marketing solutions. 
We reach our clients utilizing a multi-channel sales approach that allows us to meet market demand through an extensive inside and outside sales force, channel partners, and targeted digital campaigns. Our nationwide field sales force allows us to have local and virtual interactions with SMB clients, which differentiates us from our competitors.
We derive a competitive advantage from our industry experience, sizable sales force, and Thryv platform. Existing and potential SMBs have choices when selecting SaaS solutions. Numerous niche cloud-based tools are available for SMBs to self-provision online, and other providers market competing end-to-end solutions. Because the cost of entry into the SaaS space is relatively low, new entrants continue to emerge. Although we believe many of these solutions lack a comprehensive set of features and offer less onboarding and customer support, SMBs may opt for less expensive solutions or a package of solutions provided by less experienced entrants at a lower cost. 
Our Solutions 
Comprehensive Marketing Services Offering 
We have a full portfolio of marketing solutions for SMBs, including PYP, IYP, SEM, and online display and social advertising, online presence and video, and SEO tools. This enables SMBs to craft a comprehensive marketing strategy with us as the one-stop provider. For example, PYP provides value to SMBs seeking to reach consumers who prefer traditional forms of print media. IYP helps efficiently position a client’s business on well-trafficked online directories, and SEM allows SMBs to generate customer traffic directly with ads on Google and other search engines.
Leading Presence in Print Advertising 
As the largest publisher of print directories in the United States, we provide clients with insights into how traditional media can reach and advertise to a large segment of the consumer population. In the United States, PYP users tend to be over 55 years of age, more affluent and more likely to own a single-family home, resulting in higher sales conversion rates for our SMB clients.
Dynamic Tracking and Access to Unparalleled SMB Data 
The effectiveness of each of our solutions can be measured with tracking software that enables SMBs to easily analyze the performance of their ad campaigns. We examine operational measures from various sources that help us understand how a client’s marketing services program is working, and we use these to monitor their effectiveness and performance. As a result, we give SMBs actionable insights to attract and retain new customers.
Enable SMBs to Deliver Customer Experiences That We View as Best-in-Class within One Platform 
Our Thryv platform delivers many features relevant to SMB needs, including CRM, omnichannel email and text marketing automation, scheduling and appointment management, estimating, invoicing, payments, social media management, reputation management, document management and centralized customer communication. Thryv provides SMBs a real time 360-degree view of their customers and every interaction that each customer has with their business throughout their lifecycle.
Optimize Advertising Budgets and Business Leads Generation 
Our Thryv Leads solution recommends an appropriate dollar budget for each SMB based on its business vertical and market geography. Thryv Leads chooses the optimal mix of advertising solutions for each SMB by using machine learning to generate a tailored solution for each of our clients. Thryv Leads then automatically injects resulting business leads into the SMB’s CRM system, while also enriching the basic consumer information with additional data. SMBs are then able to contact and engage new and existing customers. 
Our Strategy
Continuous Innovation Drives Retention and Growth 
In our Marketing Services business, we continue to improve the value of our solutions and leverage our extensive sales force to drive the retention of clients. For example, in our PYP business, we have simplified ad pricing, added colorful new local covers, and modified book formatting to make the books more useful and readable. Additionally, we increasingly renew digital (non-print) accounts through an automated process. In our SEM business, we have improved our bidding process, launched new features and boosted traffic from distribution partner sites. In our SaaS business, we continue to improve our Thryv platform by analyzing user behavior and client requests to expand the feature set and interoperability with other popular cloud-based tools. We continue to improve Thryv Leads which uses machine learning to optimize the placement of the SMBs’ ads and help SMBs reduce their costs. 
Transition into SaaS 
Our current executive team came on board in 2014 with a plan to expand beyond the legacy Marketing Services segment into the SaaS segment. Our plan has been, and continues to be, to develop and grow our SaaS segment to better help SMBs manage their businesses, while continuing to maintain strong profitability within our Marketing Services segment, which drives new customer leads to our clients. We have selectively utilized a portion of the cash generated from our profitable Marketing Services segment to support initiatives in our evolving SaaS segment, which has represented an increasing percentage of total revenue since launch. The SaaS segment became profitable during 2019. 
Leverage Our Nationwide Scale and Extensive Sales Force
We have one of the largest SMB-focused sales forces in the country within the marketing solutions and SaaS space, which we utilize to attract and manage our clients. We leverage our sales force to introduce our SaaS solutions to new prospects and existing Marketing Services clients through in-person, local as well as virtual, online meetings. As of 
December 31, 2021, our efforts led to approximately 60% of our new SaaS clients originating from our Marketing Services segment. SMB demand for SaaS solutions continues to grow as SMBs increase their remote working capabilities and contact less customer interactions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Actively Manage Shift in Marketing Services Revenue Mix to Maintain Profitability 
We continue to manage our Marketing Services offerings, some of which are in secular decline, notably print, to maximize profitability and extend the life of these solutions. Our cost management strategy includes the utilization of third-party printers and cost-effective long-term paper, printing, and directory distribution contracts. 
Continued Cash Flow Generation and Selected Capital Allocation 
We remain highly focused on methodically managing our assets, maintaining a highly variable cost structure, and building our SaaS business in a way to continue to position us to generate significant cash flow. We believe that our cash flow generation and strategic capital allocation will enable us to continue to reduce debt and pursue acquisitions to create value for our stockholders. We will continue to employ a disciplined financial policy that maintains our financial strength and favorable cost structure. 
Opportunistic Acquisitions to Drive Synergy 
The Company has experience executing accretive acquisitions in the industry. We believe we are well-positioned to continue this strategy to leverage our platform and scale in our industry. Historically, as a result of our acquisitions, we have realized significant cost synergies and obtained new clients that also bought our SaaS solutions. 
International Growth 
We are looking to expand into international markets, which we view as a large opportunity for growth. In August 2020, we launched our first international SaaS reseller pilot, a joint initiative with the leading yellow pages player in the Caribbean, and we also signed a SaaS franchise client, a home services company, with operations in the U.S. and Canada. We intend to penetrate international markets either through acquisition, re-seller agreements, or other commercial arrangements. For example, in 2021, we completed the Thryv Australia Acquisition to enter the Australian market. Internationally, there are approximately 35 million SMBs in our target market. On February 1, 2022, we continued our international expansion with an online launch into the Canadian marketing via our online website Thryv.ca.
Our Segments
We operate through three segments – Marketing Services, SaaS and Thryv International – each of which is described below.
Marketing Services Segment
Our Marketing Services segment delivers high-quality, cost-effective business leads to our SMB clients. This segment generated $797.5 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our main Marketing Services solutions are as follows:
Print Yellow Pages (PYP)
Domestically, we publish PYP titles on a 12 to 15-month publication cycle. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we published approximately 1,502 PYP titles. We generate revenue by charging for advertisements placed within these titles. 
We believe print directories are a cost-effective and often under-appreciated solution for many SMBs. Consumer usage of print, while declining, is still strong among consumers that tend to be over 55 years of age, more affluent, and more likely to own a single-family home. PYP enables SMBs to reach this core demographic that tends to have higher purchase intent when encountering one of our SMBs’ advertisements. We have highly predictable revenue from this service offering given that PYP advertising campaigns are typically structured as 12 to 15-month contracts. While PYP has experienced a secular decline similar to other print media, print costs are highly variable, enabling the Company to right-size costs in advance of anticipated declines in PYP sales.
Internet Yellow Pages (IYP)
We operate three proprietary IYP sites: Yellowpages.com, Superpages.com, and Dexknows.com. During the year ended December 31, 2021, traffic to these sites averaged over 29 million visits per month across the three properties. We generate IYP revenue by charging SMBs for advertisements and priority placement. 
Our IYPs are efficient in delivering business leads. IYPs deliver leads at an attractive cost because consumers who search on IYPs are deep in the “purchase funnel” and are ready to buy. 
We also offer ESS enabling SMBs to buy advertising on our network of owned and third-party directory websites, including Yelp, Nextdoor, and other popular sites. Our network delivers approximately 104 million visits per month. Our ESS network provides SMB clients expanded access to high-converting traffic at a low cost. We believe we are the only provider to offer this broad network of online directory sites with a single purchase. 
Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
Search engines deliver paid and organic (free) listing results. Two factors drive paid rankings:
•    the advertiser's bid price, and
•    click-through rate (the rate at which users click through to the ad).
This results in a quality score that determines the ranking of the ad in the paid results.
Organic results are ranked based on an algorithm that determines the relevancy of that listing to the user’s query.
SMBs often purchase advertisements in the paid listings section of search engines and online directories to drive business leads. We sell SEM placements on multiple search sites, including Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, and online directories including Yelp, CityGrid, and Whitepages, among others. 
Our SEM offerings leverage a mix of in-house and off-the-shelf technology to design ads, generate bids, and deliver reporting to advertisers. We track cost-per-click and cost-per-call metrics for our SMB clients, which gives them insights into the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. 
Other Digital Media Solutions 
We also provide online display and social advertising, online presence and video, and SEO tools. The following services were previously sold on a standalone basis, and clients who had purchased these services are allowed to renew them. However, for new clients, these services are now only available as part of, or as an add-on purchase to, our Thryv platform. 
•Online Display and Social Advertising. We enable our clients to promote their company's image through online advertising that drives leads and brand recognition;
•Online Presence and Video. We help our client's businesses look vibrant and engaging. We record videos on-site using a partner that we view as best-in-class;
•SEO Tools. Works to improve rankings within search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. We make our client's website more visible and prominent.
SaaS Business Segment
Our SaaS segment is comprised of Thryv®, including Hub by Thryv, and Thryv Leads and add-ons, including ThryvPay. Our SaaS segment generated revenue of $170.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Strength of the All-In-One Platform
Our Thryv platform is an easy-to-use SMB end-to-end customer experience tool that enables SMBs to deliver the same type of interaction consumers have come to expect from larger enterprises with whom they do business. 
Our Thryv platform’s feature set mirrors the journey of a typical consumer, who begins on a search engine, reads business reviews, finds a company’s website and/or social media profiles, and clicks to set up an appointment or request information. After booking an appointment, the consumer typically expects an estimate and eventually an invoice, with the ability to pay online in an easy and efficient manner. This experience is then followed by prompts for reviews and referrals, along with periodic reminders and additional campaigns to generate repeat business.
Built on a customizable CRM database where businesses store customer information and then utilize a host of customer communication tools, our Thryv platform helps SMBs communicate with their customers and manage day-to-day operations. It automatically updates and maintains client listings across the web so our SMBs’ online information is correct at all times.
Clients can also generate new business leads via Thryv Leads and have these business leads automatically injected into their CRM system and enriched with additional data. These business leads populate the client’s CRM database enabling our clients to email, text, call, or otherwise communicate with prospective customers via our Thryv platform. Additionally, clients can monitor multiple locations through Thryv add-ons.
We have a new, low cost and innovative engineering methodology. This methodology recognizes the large variety of bespoke SaaS solutions and back-end tools that are readily available. Thryv has chosen to utilize best in class systems and tools, to integrate them in unique ways that unlock value for the end customer. It is the combination of functionality from multiple platforms together that delivers value greater than each of the parts individually. Thryv maintains full control over the user experience, to deliver a modern and consistent user experience. When Thryv feels functionality is of strategic long-term importance, or it is not readily available in the marketplace, we leverage our internal engineering teams to create technology and innovation on top of the existing interoperable technology stack. Applications and/or features developed by our third-party developers specifically for our platform are not available outside of our platform on a stand-alone basis in the U.S. and Canada. 
Our Thryv platform is sold on a monthly auto-subscription basis, which generates a recurring revenue stream. Substantially all of our clients subscribe to contracts with a minimum six-month upfront commitment, after which clients continue on a month-to-month basis. Clients can upgrade their service into a more feature-rich solution at any time as their business grows. We offer a variety of tiers, which we believe enables SMBs to choose the optimal features for their business. We believe the platform represents an attractive value for our SMB clients as compared to competitor products, such as single solutions or complex enterprise software systems that are suited to larger companies. 
Hub by Thryv
In 2020, we released a franchise management platform, Hub by Thryv, that allows franchisors to manage and launch their franchises on Thryv and to manage their overall franchise network’s day-to-day operations on the platform.
Hub by Thryv enables franchisors to:
•Create and launch new locations under a standardized brand and configuration, ensuring optimal success for each location;
•Monitor real-time performance results on each of their locations, and quickly identify areas of opportunity;
•Generally manage lead management and long-term ROI through each stage of the customer's life cycle; and
•Enable territory and region managers' optimal flexibility through user permissions and controls.
Thryv Leads
Thryv Leads is an enhancement to our Thryv platform that gives SMBs an easier way to acquire new customers and to make it simpler to determine when, where and how much to spend on advertising. Thryv Leads clients sign six month contracts with month-to-month auto renewals thereafter.
Thryv Leads uses machine learning to optimize the placement of the SMBs’ ads and help SMBs reduce their costs. Thryv Leads automatically injects resulting business leads into the SMB’s CRM system, while also enriching the basic consumer information with additional data. SMBs are then able to contact and engage new and existing customers. We believe via Thryv Leads and its integration with our Thryv platform, we are the only SaaS player that offers a business leads-based solution integrated into an end-to-end customer experience. The data that we have gathered from our hundreds of thousands of marketing campaigns informs the predictive capabilities of the platform, making it more valuable to each of our SMB clients. This enables SMBs to craft a comprehensive marketing strategy with us as the one-stop provider. 
Through Thryv Leads, SMBs:
•Acquire New Customers. Thryv Leads allows SMBs to acquire new customers by indicating how many new customers per month they want to reach. SMBs decide on the number of business leads per month that they need, and Thryv Leads recommends a budget based on the costs in the client’s category and geographical area. Thryv Leads then delineates the SMB’s spend across advertising solutions, such as digital and social media, allowing SMBs to avoid the confusion of determining a proper ad budget;
•Simplify Lead Tracking. Thryv Leads tracks and attributes each business lead that the SMB receives; and
•Analyze Advertising Results. Thryv Leads provides the SMB with proof that the SMB’s advertising is effective and enables SMBs to leverage consumer respondent information by injecting data into the SMB’s Thryv platform, creating a usable database for SMBs.
ThryvPay
ThryvPay allows users to get paid via credit card and ACH payments. ThryvPay offers:
•Competitive credit card processing rates. ThryvPay offers a flat rate per transaction with no set-up fees.
•ACH payments processing. Small businesses save money on a per transaction charge, with the security of knowing immediately if funds are available.
•Scheduled payments. Service-based businesses that offer ongoing services or memberships can utilize our scheduled payments feature. ThryvPay also allows customized installment plans for pre-set specific dates.
•Convenience fees and tipping. Small businesses can pass on optional convenience fees for consumers who want to pay by credit card when presented with multiple payment options, often driving customers to pay by ACH methods, which generates significant savings to SMBs. ThryvPay also allows consumers to leave a tip.
•Credit card and bank account on file. Consumer information is stored in the small business’s Thryv account for future transactions, reducing friction for repeat business.
•Real-time reporting and assistance. Thryv and ThryvPay integrates and auto-syncs with QuickBooks Online, Quickbooks Desktop, MYOB, Freshbooks, and Xero for accounting reconciliation. Thryv provides dedicated support for dispute and chargeback assistance.
Thryv International Segment
Our Thryv International segment delivers high-quality, cost-effective business leads to our SMB clients. This segment generated $145.4 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our main Thryv International solutions are as follows:
Print Yellow and White Pages (PYP)
Internationally, we publish PYP titles on a 12-month publication cycle. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we published approximately 96 PYP titles. In 2021, we delivered more than 6 million PYP directories internationally to strategically targeted Australian homes whose demographics indicated a higher propensity to use print marketing solutions. We generate revenue by charging for advertisements placed within these titles. 
Internet Yellow and White Pages (IYP)
Internationally, we operate four proprietary IYP sites: Yellowpages.com.au, Whitepages.com.au, Whereis.com, and Truelocal.com.au. During the year ended December 31, 2021, traffic to these sites averaged over 7 million visits per month across the four properties. We generate IYP revenue by charging SMBs for advertisements and priority placement. 
Search Engine Marketing (SEM) 
Search engines deliver paid and organic (free) listing results. Two factors drive paid rankings:
•    the advertiser's bid price, and
•    click-through rate (the rate at which users click through to the ad).
This results in a quality score that determines the ranking of the ad in the paid results.
Organic results are ranked based on an algorithm that determines the relevancy of that listing to the user’s query.
SMBs often purchase advertisements in the paid listings section of search engines and online directories to drive business leads. We sell SEM placements on multiple search sites, including Google and Bing.
Our SEM offerings leverage a mix of in-house and off-the-shelf technology to design ads, generate bids, and deliver reporting to advertisers. We track cost-per-click and cost-per-call metrics for our SMB clients, which gives them insights into the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. 
Other Digital Media Solutions
We also provide online display and social advertising, online presence and video, and SEO tools. These services were previously sold on a stand alone basis, and clients who had purchased these services are allowed to renew them. However, for new clients, these services are now only available as part of, or as an add-on purchase to, our Thryv platform. 
SaaS 
Consistent with our SaaS segment, our Thryv International SaaS revenue is comprised of Thryv® and add-ons. Thryv International generated SaaS revenue of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Our Competition
Our industry is highly fragmented, intensely competitive, and constantly evolving. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. We believe the principal competitive factors in our segments are the following:
•customized, integrated, and tailored solution strategies;
•flexible technology that is compatible with third-party applications and data sources;
•quality;
•pricing;
•ease of use;
•brand recognition and word-of-mouth referrals;
•availability of onboarding programs and customer support; and 
•nationwide and extensive, inside and outside sales forces.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to all these factors and that we are well-positioned as a leading provider of marketing solutions and cloud-based end-to-end customer experience tools to SMBs across the United States.
We face competition from other companies that provide marketing solutions and cloud-based SaaS tools to SMBs.
Marketing Services Competitors 
In our Marketing Services business, we compete with numerous national companies that sell marketing campaigns on major national search engines and social media sites and build and host websites.
SaaS Competitors 
In our SaaS business, we believe we compete with three general categories of competitors:
•Point Solution Providers. We compete with single-point solution providers across many features. Many of these products are low-cost and some have been in the market longer than Thryv.
•Vertical Solutions. Vertical solutions exist in many categories, including Home Services, Health & Wellness, Animal Services, Professional Services and Educational Services. Competitors have studied these categories and customized their products for the applicable category. These companies offer a tailored solution with a targeted appeal. Some also have consumer-facing apps that create demand for the SMB.
•All-In-One Competitors. Our most direct competitors are other all-in-one solutions. Several are priced above our price point or target larger companies with more employees.
Human Capital
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract the right talent, develop potential future and current talent for leadership positions, retain high performers and reward employees through competitive pay and employee benefits. We support these objectives with employee experience and culture initiatives aimed at making the workplace diverse, engaging and inclusive, while providing growth opportunities, internal leadership programs and diversity programs. In addition, we consistently monitor employee engagement through employee engagement studies and monthly surveys. 

We employed 2,630 people as of December 31, 2021. Our workforce is comprised of approximately 99% full-time and 1% part-time employees. The majority of our employees are employed in our Outside and Inside Sales, Inbound Sales and Sales Operations, and Operations, Information Technology, Billing and Print Directories departments.
Some examples of our key programs and initiatives intended to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:
•Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”). The Company’s Diversity Council provides a voice for our employees to leadership – to share insights, communicate with leadership, and generate ideas and actions to enhance and impact diversity and inclusion at Thryv. The Diversity Council plans and sponsors events to celebrate diversity and inclusion, educate and raise awareness, and create opportunities for networking and mentorship within diverse groups. 
•Accelerators Recognition Program. This program is designed to grow the connection and recognition of top performers who demonstrate our core values in their excellent performance. Core values are:
•Client Devoted
•DONE3
•Act Like You Own the Place
•Invest in Our People
•Under Promise, Over Deliver
•Making Money is a By-Product of Helping People
•Think Long-Term; Act with Passion and Integrity
•Benefits. Among our benefit offerings, Virgin Pulse wellness programming has become a key motivator to good health and well-being. It is a user-friendly platform that encourages well-being, safety and performance, by providing friendly team-based competition, self-directed wellness journeys and incentives to build healthy habits and drive collaboration across Thryv. With 76% of employees enrolled on the platform and 54% of those enrolled actively engaged, the digital well-being platform has contributed meaningfully to our Work From Anywhere approach while creating connections and supporting a healthy lifestyle among our employees.
•Talent Development. We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers through training and development programs. These include online and on-the-job learning formats. 
•Our Emerging Leaders Program is designed to help identify and develop future leaders. Once identified, Emerging Leaders are provided focused leadership and management skill development programs – instructor-
led, online and on-the-job. Thirty-three employees successfully completed the Emerging Leader program in 2021, resulting in seven promotions into management – representing 21% of participants. The program continues into 2022 with plans for a larger number of participants to more broadly impact our workforce and positively support leadership bench strength.
•Our New Manager Training Program is provided to newly promoted managers to develop and enhance their soft skills in people management. This program aims to set up newly promoted people managers for success while developing a network of colleagues from which to draw support and counsel.
•The Tuition Assistance Program (“TAP”) supports lifelong learning of all employees. Through a generous reimbursement program, we encourage employees to seek continuous education and personal development to support their career aspirations while contributing to Thryv’s collective growth and success. Eligible coursework may be aimed at achievement of an Associate’s, Bachelor or Master’s degree or may be specialized in various certificate/certification programs.
•Culture Team. “Invest in Our People” is one of our core values, which we support with various initiatives.
•Our Thryv Life Channel (facilitated by Microsoft Teams) serves as our internal social media platform. The platform provides a vehicle to highlight personal and professional successes, share inspirational stories, publicize social opportunities, run “fun” employee-centric virtual events and generally connect our people. Engagement is high and continues to enhance the promotion of core values and relationship-building as we continue learn and grow in a Work From Anywhere environment.
•Learning Opportunities. To ensure we are providing learning opportunities that enable us to adapt, belong and connect, we launched monthly “Lunch and Learn” sessions featuring a wide variety of employee-centric topics such as building one’s personal brand, communication skills, and other specific skill-building subjects.
•Culture Clubs are designed to purposefully drive connection and relationship-building across diverse work teams and individuals. Recognizing the virtual workplace can be challenging for new relationship-building, the Culture Clubs offer meaningful opportunities to a broad group of employees to identify and join groups of colleagues with similar hobbies and interests.
•Virtual Onboarding. We are focused on virtually onboarding new employees through an enhanced virtual onboarding program. Video engagements, networking, a buddy program and social interactions are all included in properly onboarding a virtual employee while weaving core values and key job learnings into the programming.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties have asserted copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us or our clients. Litigation and associated expenses may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights.
Our Use of Technology 
In Marketing Services, our print directories are published using a customized platform supported by our in-house engineering team. Our IYPs are managed by our in-house engineering team using proprietary software that we build and maintain. Other digital Marketing Services offerings are fulfilled in-house using third-party cloud-based software.
Our Thryv platform is comprised of unique integrations and solutions either built by Thryv or built for Thryv, and to Thryv’s specifications. In addition, we integrate with select third-party vendors who are managed by our in-house product and development teams. Thryv has chosen to utilize best-in-class systems and tools, to integrate them in unique ways that unlock value for the end customer. SaaS order processing and tracking, client engagement, client communications, and many other aspects of running the day-to-day SaaS business are performed using subscription-based third-party tools. When Thryv feels functionality is of strategic long-term importance, or it is not readily available in the marketplace, we leverage our internal engineering teams to create technology and innovation on top of the existing interoperable technology stack. We ensure that we retain intellectual property for the critical elements of the Thryv platform. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and other foreign laws and regulations, including those related to privacy, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor and taxation. 
Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of our company. However, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our business.
