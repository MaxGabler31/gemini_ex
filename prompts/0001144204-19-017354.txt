ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
General Description of Business
 
Structure
 
The Lightstone REIT II is a Maryland corporation, formed on April 28, 2008, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2009.
 
The Lightstone REIT II is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LP (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership formed on April 30, 2008.
 
The Lightstone REIT II and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT II, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 
 
We currently have one operating segment. As of December 31, 2018, we majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of 17 limited service hotels containing a total of 2,135 rooms. Additionally, we held a 48.6% membership interest in Brownmill, LLC (“Brownmill”) and a 50.0% joint venture ownership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the “Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture”), both of which we account for under the equity method of accounting.
 
Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of The Lightstone Group, LLC. The Lightstone Group, LLC served as the sponsor (the ‘‘Sponsor’’) during our public offerings which terminated on September 27, 2014. Our Advisor, together with our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), is and will continue to be primarily responsible for making investment decisions and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner of our Advisor and the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP II LLC, the associate general partner of our Operating Partnership. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT II or the Operating Partnership.
 
We do not have any employees that are not also employed by our Sponsor or its affiliates. We depend substantially on our Advisor, which generally has responsibility for our day-to-day operations. We have entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which the Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We pay the Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we reimburse the Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf. Additionally, under the terms of the advisory agreement, our Advisor also undertakes to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to present to us investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives as adopted by our Board of Directors.
 
2


Our Advisor has affiliated property managers (the “Property Managers”), which may manage certain of the properties we acquire. We also use other unaffiliated third-party property managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our Advisor owned 20,000 shares of common stock which were issued on May 20, 2008 for $200,000, or $10.00 per share. Effective October 1, 2009, the Operating Partnership commenced operations. As of December 31, 2018, we held a 99% general partnership interest in our Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
Our shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any market for our shares of common stock until they are listed for trading. In the event we do not obtain listing prior to the tenth anniversary of the completion or termination of our follow-on offering (the “Follow-On Offering”), which was terminated on September 27, 2014, our charter requires that our Board of Directors must either (i) seek stockholder approval of an extension or amendment of this listing deadline; or (ii) seek stockholder approval to adopt a plan of liquidation of the corporation.
 
Noncontrolling Interests
 
Partners of the Operating Partnership
 
On May 20, 2008, our Advisor contributed $2,000 to our Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner common units in our Operating Partnership. The limited partner has the right to convert Operating Partnership common units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our shares of our common stock, as allowed by our limited partnership agreement.
 
From our inception through the termination of the Follow-On Offering, Lightstone SLP II LLC, which is wholly owned by our Sponsor, contributed (i) cash of approximately $12.9 million and (ii) equity interests totaling 48.6% in Brownmill, which were valued at $4.8 million, to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 177.0 subordinated profits interests (the “Subordinated Profits Interests”) in the Operating Partnership with an aggregate value of $17.7 million.
 
Other Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries
 
Other noncontrolling interests consist of (i) membership interests held by Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (“Lightstone I”), a related party REIT also sponsored by the Company’s Sponsor in a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) formed between the Company and Lightstone I and (ii) the membership interests held by minority owners in certain of our hotels.
Operations - Operating Partnership Activity
 
Through our Operating Partnership, we have and will continue to seek to primarily acquire and operate hospitality properties and to a lesser extent, acquire and operate other commercial properties (such as retail and industrial) and residential properties, and make real estate-related investments, principally in North America through our Operating Partnership. Our holdings currently consist of hospitality properties and retail (multi-tenanted shopping centers). All of our properties have been and will continue to be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with others. Since inception, we have completed the following significant property and investments transactions:

Related Parties
 
Our Advisor and its affiliates, and Lightstone SLP II, LLC are related parties. Certain of these entities have or will receive compensation and fees for services related to our offerings and will continue to receive compensation and fees for services provided for the investment and management of our assets. These entities have received and/or will receive fees during our offering stage (which was completed on September 27, 2014), acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during our offering stage were based on percentages of the offering proceeds raised and the compensation levels during our acquisition and operational stages are based on the cost of acquired properties and the annual revenue earned from such properties, and other such fees outlined in each of the respective agreements.
Primary Investment Objectives and Strategies
 
Our primary investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. We intend to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties.
Acquisition and Investment Policies
 
We have and/or intend to continue to acquire commercial (including full-service or select service hotels and retail properties) and residential real estate assets, as well as other real estate-related investments principally in North America. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. Unlike other REITs, which typically specialize in one sector of the real estate market, we invest and intend to continue to invest in both residential and commercial properties as well as other real estate-related investments to create a diverse portfolio of property types and take advantage of our Sponsor’s expertise in acquiring larger properties and portfolios of both residential and commercial properties. We generally intend to hold each property for seven to ten years.
 
We are not limited in the number, size or geographical location of any real estate assets. The number and mix of assets we acquire depends, in part, upon real estate and market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we acquire our assets. We may expand our focus to include properties located outside the United States. If we invest in properties outside of the United States, we intend to focus on properties which we believe to have similar characteristics as those properties in which we have previous investment and management expertise. We do not anticipate that these international investments would comprise more than 10% of our portfolio. Investment in areas outside of the United States may be subject to risks different than those impacting properties in the United States.

We have made and/or may make the following types of real estate investments:
 

• | Fee interests in market-rate, multifamily properties located either in or near major metropolitan areas. We will attempt to identify those sub-markets with job growth opportunities and demand demographics which support potential long-term value appreciation for multifamily properties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fee interests in power shopping centers and malls located in highly trafficked retail corridors, in selected high-barrier to entry markets and sub-markets. “Power” shopping centers are large retail complexes that are generally unenclosed and located in suburban areas that typically contain one or more large brand name retailers rather than a department store anchor tenant. We will attempt to identify those sub-markets with constraints on the amount of additional property supply, which will make future competition less likely.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fee interests in improved, multi-tenanted, industrial properties and properties that contain industrial and office space (“industrial flex”) located near major transportation arteries and distribution corridors with limited management responsibilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fee interests in improved, multi-tenanted, office properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fee interests in lodging properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preferred equity interests in entities that own the property types listed above.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mezzanine loans secured by the pledges of equity interests in entities that own the property types listed above.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercial mortgage-backed securities secured by mortgages on real property.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collateralized debt obligations.
--+---------------------------------


• | Investments in equity securities issued by public or private real estate companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, we may diversify our portfolio by investing up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly. We may also acquire majority or minority interests in other entities (or business units of such entities) with investment objectives similar to ours or with management, investment or development capabilities that our Board of Directors deems desirable or advantageous to acquire.
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
We have and intend to continue to utilize leverage to make our investments. The number of different investments we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us, we may purchase certain investments for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. There is no limitation on the amount we may invest in any single investment or on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any investment.
 
Our charter restricts the aggregate amount we may borrow, both secured and unsecured, to 300% of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of the Board of Directors and disclosure to the stockholders. In addition, our charter limits our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings (having a maturity greater than two years) to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all investments unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders. Our charter also prohibits us from making or investing in mortgage loans, including construction loans, on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including our loans, would exceed 85% of the property’s appraised value.
 
We may finance our investment acquisitions through a variety of means, including but not limited to single property mortgages, as well as, mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of property and through exchange of an interest in the property for limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to finance our investments with debt which will be on a non-recourse basis. However, we may, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders, if we believe this may result in more favorable terms.
 
Distribution Objectives
 
U.S. federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to continue to qualify for REIT status, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available.

Distributions, if any, are authorized at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. Such analyses may include actual and anticipated operating cash flow, capital expenditure needs, general financial and market conditions, proceeds from asset sales and other factors that our board of directors deem relevant. Our Board of Directors’ decisions will be substantially influenced by their obligation to ensure that we maintain our federal tax status as a REIT. We commenced regular quarterly distributions beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009. We may fund future distributions with cash proceeds from borrowings if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund distributions. Our ability to continue to pay regular distributions and the size of these distributions will depend upon a variety of factors. For example, our borrowing policy permits us to incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less, and we may have to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We cannot assure that regular quarterly distributions will continue to be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have established or may establish.
 
We are an accrual basis taxpayer, and as such our REIT taxable income could be higher than the cash available to us. We may therefore borrow to make distributions, which could reduce the cash available to us, in order to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income as a condition to our election to be taxed as a REIT. These distributions made with borrowed funds may constitute a return of capital to stockholders. “Return of capital” refers to distributions to investors in excess of net income. To the extent that distributions to stockholders exceed earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although such distributions might not reduce stockholders’ aggregate invested capital. Because our earnings and profits are reduced for depreciation and other non-cash items, it is likely that a portion of each distribution will constitute a tax-deferred return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
On March 30, 2009, our Board of Directors declared an annualized distribution rate for each quarterly period commencing 30 days subsequent to us achieving the minimum offering of 500,000 shares of our common stock. The distribution was calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00178082191 per share per day (the “Initial Annualized Distribution Rate”), and equaled a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal a 6.5% annualized rate based on the share price of $10.00.
 
At the beginning of October 2009, we achieved our minimum offering of 500,000 shares of common stock and on November 3, 2009, our Board of Directors declared our first quarterly distribution at the Initial Annualized Distribution Rate for the three-month period ending December 31, 2009. Subsequently, our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly distributions at the Initial Annualized Distribution Rate.
 
On September 25, 2015, the Board of Directors resolved that any future distributions declared to our shareholders of record each day during the applicable quarter would be targeted to be paid at a rate of $0.0019178 per day (the “Revised Annualized Distribution Rate”), which would equal a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal a 7.0% annualized rate based on a share price of $10.00, which would be an increase over the prior quarterly distributions of an annualized rate of 6.5%. Commencing with the three-month period ended December 31, 2015, our Board of Directors has declared regular quarterly distributions at the Revised Annualized Distribution Rate.
 
Additionally, on February 28, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a special distribution, payable to stockholders of record on February 28, 2017, for the difference between the Revised Annualized Distribution Rate and the Initial Annualized Distribution Rate for the period from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2015. This distribution was calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.000136986 per share per day, and equals a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal an 0.5% annualized rate based on the share price of $10.00. The Company had previously commenced making regular quarterly distributions to shareholders at the Revised Annualized Distribution Rate for quarterly periods commencing on October 1, 2015. Additionally, on February 28, 2017, the Board of Directors also declared a special distribution on the Subordinated Profits Interests for the period commencing with their issuance through December 31, 2017 at the Revised Annualized Distribution Rate. The special distributions declared on February 28, 2017 are collectively referred to as the “Catch-Up Distribution.” The Catch-Up Distribution, which was paid on March 15, 2017, totaled $6.3 million ($2.1 million and $4.2 million on common shares and Subordinated Profits Interests, respectively.)
 
Total distributions declared during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $12.6 million and $14.9 million, respectively.
 
On March 19, 2019, we declared the quarterly distribution for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 at the Revised Annualized Distribution Rate payable to stockholders of record on the close of business on the last day of the quarter, which will be paid on or about April 15, 2019.

DRIP and Share Repurchase Programs
 
Our distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) provided our stockholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a discount by reinvesting distributions. On January 19, 2015, our Board of Directors suspended our DRIP effective April 15, 2015. For so long as the DRIP remains suspended, all future distributions will be in the form of cash.
 
Our share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions. From our inception through December 31, 2017, we redeemed 0.7 million common shares at an average price per share of $9.60 per share. During 2018, we redeemed 0.3 million common shares or 58% of redemption requests received during the period, at an average price per share of $9.89 per share. We funded share redemptions for the periods noted above from the cumulative proceeds of the sale of shares of common shares pursuant to our DRIP and from our operating funds.
 
Prior to December 13, 2018, the price at which stockholders who have held shares of common stock for the required one-year period may sell shares of common stock back to us was the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share of common stock or (ii) the purchase price per share of common stock if purchased at a reduced price.  In the case of the death of the stockholder, the purchase price per share was the lesser of the actual amount paid by the stockholder to acquire the shares or $10.00 per share.
 
On December 13, 2018, our Board of Directors amended our Share Repurchase Program to immediately change the price for all purchases under our Share Repurchase Program from the lesser of $10.00 per share or the purchase price per share to 100% of the estimated net asset value per share of the Company’s common stock, which is $10.00 per share as of December 31, 2017.
 
Our Board of Directors may amend the terms of our Share Repurchase Program without stockholder approval upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders. Our Board of Directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders or to reject any request for repurchase and there is no assurance our Board of Directors will not suspend or terminate the program or reject requests for repurchases.
 
Tax Status
 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2009. If we remain qualified as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
 
To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
Competition
 
The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and rental revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels are located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry may increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we will not be associated.
 
We have or may compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.

Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay investments, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability make distributions to stockholders.
 
We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
 
Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the industries in which we operate to potentially offer existing owners the opportunity to contribute properties to Lightstone REIT II in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we may have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.
 
Environmental
 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees
 
We do not have employees. We have entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We have paid and will continue to pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we have reimbursed and will continue to reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.
