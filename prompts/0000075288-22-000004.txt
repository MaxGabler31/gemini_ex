Item 1.   Business
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
Overview
We are a leading branded apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide, TBBC and Duck Head lifestyle brands. Our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection can command greater loyalty and higher price points and create licensing opportunities. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value, and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. Our ability to compete successfully in the apparel industry is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.
To further strengthen each lifestyle brand’s connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through digital and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of our brands. Advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.
Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, in the aggregate, represented 90% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2021. During Fiscal 2021, 80% of our consolidated net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution, which consists of our brand specific full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, Tommy Bahama food and beverage operations and Tommy Bahama outlets. During Fiscal 2021, our breakdown of our consolidated net sales by direct to consumer channel was as follows: full-price retail of $386 million, or 34%; e-commerce of $369 million, or 32%, food and beverage of $96 million, or 8%, and outlet operations of $57 million, or 5%. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a digital or physical setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. 
Our 186 full-price retail stores allow us the opportunity to carry a full line of current season merchandise, including apparel, accessories and other products, all presented in an aspirational brand-specific atmosphere. We believe that our full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers. Further, we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the full-price retail stores with limited in-store promotional activities enhance the value and reputation of our lifestyle brands and, in turn, strengthen our business and relationships with key wholesale customers. While about one-half of our retail locations are located in resort or travel-to destinations and states, we believe there are also opportunities in both warmer and colder climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting.
Our brand-specific e-commerce business continues to grow, and our e-commerce sales are expected to exceed full-price retail sales in Fiscal 2022. Our e-commerce business is very profitable for our lifestyle brands as we have average e-commerce order values in excess of $125 and a high full-price gross margin of approximately 70%. Our high average order value and high gross margins allow us to absorb any incremental picking, packing and freight expense associated with operating an e-commerce business and still maintain a high profit margin on e-commerce sales.

The remaining 20% of our net sales was generated through our wholesale distribution channels. Our wholesale operations include net sales of products bearing our lifestyle brands. The wholesale operations complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger base of consumers. Our wholesale operations include sales to various specialty stores, Signature Stores, better department stores, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and other retailers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach. In Fiscal 2021, our wholesale sales also included $25 million of net sales, by our Lanier Apparel operating group, which we exited in Fiscal 2021. 
We operate in a highly competitive apparel market that continues to evolve rapidly with the expanding application of technology to fashion retail. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods, which continues to be evidenced by weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. The competitive and evolving environment requires that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, very differently than they had historically and may result in increased operating costs and capital investments to generate growth or even maintain sales levels. 
The apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. Also, in recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic consumers have chosen to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. 
Many of the changes in the industry noted above were accelerated or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in Fiscal 2021, the United States economy, as well as the apparel retail industry and our own business operations, began experiencing very strong growth in consumer demand and also began encountering various challenges including labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and product and operating cost increases. These items have continued to impact the apparel retail industry and our business into Fiscal 2022. We, as well as others in our industry, have increased prices to attempt to offset these significant inflationary pressures. 
Investments and Opportunities
While the evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers and others who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our lifestyle brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we continue to invest in and leverage technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry. Further, each of our brands aims to further enhance its customer-focused, dynamic, thriving, digitally-driven, mobile-centered, cross-channel personalized and seamless shopping experience that recognizes and serves customers in their brand discovery and purchasing habits of the future. 
Meanwhile, we must be very diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented less than 10% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2021. 
In recent years, an important initiative for us was to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama operating group, which generated an 8% operating margin in Fiscal 2019. While we made progress on this initiative prior to the 

8



COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts were really evident in our Fiscal 2021 operating results, when Tommy Bahama increased sales by 7% compared to Fiscal 2019 and generated a 15% operating margin. This initiative remains a focus area for the long-term prospects of the business, with continued focus on sustaining our Fiscal 2021 gross margin and operating margin through many of the same areas of emphasis, including: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; refining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; and taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals.
In order to maximize the success of each of our brands, we believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Future investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations, such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and retail store and food and beverage build-out for new, relocated or remodeled locations, as well as distribution center enhancements and administrative office expenditures. 
While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria and/or take strategic measures to return capital to our shareholders as and when circumstances merit. 
Important factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on overall economic conditions and our operations in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021. In Fiscal 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed all our retail and restaurant locations, resulting in a reduction in net sales and a significant net loss after many years of profitable operating results. We began reopening our stores and restaurants in the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020 in a phased approach in accordance with local government guidelines and with additional safety protocols. After reopening many of our locations, we continued to experience reduced traffic, limited operating hours and capacity, seating and other limitations, with such factors impacting individual locations to varying degrees. There can be no assurance that additional closures will not occur in the future as a result of any resurgence of COVID-19 cases and/or additional government mandates or recommendations. In addition, the shift from in-store shopping to online shopping accelerated in Fiscal 2020 and continued in Fiscal 2021 resulting in strong growth in our e-commerce businesses.
Our mission remains the enhancement of long-term shareholder value and during Fiscal 2020, we took several actions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and liquidity, including furloughs, salary reductions, modifying arrangements with suppliers and wholesale customers, renegotiating rental arrangements with landlords, reducing our dividend and taking advantage of government relief programs. 
In Fiscal 2021, the economic environment improved significantly with a rebound in retail traffic. This improved environment and exceptionally strong consumer demand drove record net earnings. There can be no assurance that these trends will continue for our business or the broader retail apparel market. There remains significant uncertainty as to the duration and severity of the pandemic as well as the associated impact of changes in consumer discretionary spending habits, supply chain and other business disruptions, operating cost increases and inflationary pressures, general economic conditions and restrictions on our ongoing operations that result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business remains uncertain at this time.
Operating Groups
We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand’s direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable. Our business has historically been operated primarily

through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide and Lanier Apparel reportable operating groups. For additional information about each of our reportable operating groups as well as Corporate and Other, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, each included in this report. The table below presents certain financial information about each of our operating groups, as well as Corporate and Other (in thousands).

(1) | The net sales and operating income (loss) of each operating group were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic starting in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2020.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | In Fiscal 2020, we decided to exit our Lanier Apparel business, a business which had been focused on moderately priced tailored clothing and related products. This decision aligns with our stated business strategy of developing and marketing compelling lifestyle brands. It also took into consideration the increased macroeconomic challenges faced by the Lanier Apparel business, many of which were magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The exit of Lanier Apparel was completed in Fiscal 2021.

----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tommy Bahama
Tommy Bahama designs, sources, markets and distributes men’s and women’s sportswear and related products. Tommy Bahama’s typical consumer is older than 45 years old, has a household annual income in excess of $100,000, lives in or travels to warm weather and resort locations and embraces a relaxed and casual approach to daily living. Tommy Bahama products can be found in our Tommy Bahama stores and on our Tommy Bahama e-commerce website, tommybahama.com, as well as at better department stores, independent specialty stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers. We also operate Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations and license the Tommy Bahama name for various product categories. During Fiscal 2021, 96% of Tommy Bahama’s sales were in the United States, with the remaining sales in Canada and Australia.
We believe that the attraction to our consumers of the Tommy Bahama brand, which was founded in 1992, is a reflection of our efforts over many years to maintain appropriate quality and design of our Tommy Bahama apparel, accessories and licensed products, limit the distribution of Tommy Bahama products to a select tier of retailers, and effectively communicate the relaxed and casual Tommy Bahama lifestyle. We expect to continue this approach for the brand in the future. 

10



We believe there are ample opportunities to expand the direct to consumer reach of the Tommy Bahama brand in the future, while maintaining its historically select distribution. In order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Tommy Bahama brand. These investments include capital expenditures and ongoing expenses to enhance e-commerce and other technology capabilities; open new stores and Marlin Bars; remodel and/or relocate existing stores and restaurants; maintain and upgrade our distribution and other facilities; and enhance our marketing efforts to communicate the lifestyle to existing and prospective consumers.
In recent years, an important initiative for us was to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama operating group, which generated an 8% operating margin in Fiscal 2019. While we made progress on this initiative prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts were really evident in our Fiscal 2021 operating results, when Tommy Bahama increased sales by 7% compared to Fiscal 2019 and generated a 15% operating margin. This initiative remains a focus area for the long-term prospects of the business, with continued focus on sustaining our Fiscal 2021 gross margin and operating margin through many of the same areas of emphasis including: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; refining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; and taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals.
Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Tommy Bahama strategy is to operate our e-commerce websites, stores and food and beverage concepts, which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which the products are based. Our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer channels, which consist of retail store, e-commerce and restaurant operations, in the aggregate, represented 85% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2021. Retail store, e-commerce and restaurant net sales accounted for 47%, 25% and 15%, respectively, of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2021.
Our direct to consumer approach includes various e-commerce websites, including the tommybahama.com website. Our Tommy Bahama e-commerce business, which generated $184 million of net sales in Fiscal 2021, has grown significantly over the last few years, including a 39% increase in net sales compared to Fiscal 2019. Our Tommy Bahama websites allow consumers to buy Tommy Bahama products directly from us via the internet. These websites also enable us to increase our database of consumer contacts, which allows us to communicate directly and frequently with consenting consumers. As we reach more customers in the future, we anticipate that our e-commerce distribution channel for Tommy Bahama will continue to grow at a faster pace than our retail store or wholesale operations.
Our direct to consumer strategy for the Tommy Bahama brand also includes locating and operating full-price retail stores in upscale malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. Generally, we seek to locate our full-price retail stores in shopping areas and malls that have high-profile or upscale consumer brand adjacencies. As of January 29, 2022, the majority of our Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores were in street-front locations or lifestyle centers with the remainder primarily in regional indoor malls, with a number of those regional indoor locations in resort travel destinations. We believe that we have opportunities for continued sales growth for our Tommy Bahama women’s business, which represented 33% and 31% of sales in our full-price direct to consumer operations in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, with women’s swim representing about one-fourth of the women’s business. 
As of January 29, 2022, we operated 21 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations including 13 restaurants and eight Marlin Bar locations, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location. These retail-food and beverage locations, which generated approximately 25% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2021, provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate Tommy Bahama experience. We do not anticipate that the majority of our retail locations will have an adjacent food and beverage location; however, we have determined that an adjacent food and beverage location can further enhance the image or exposure of the brand in select, high-profile, brand appropriate locations. The net sales per square foot in our domestic full-price retail stores that are adjacent to a food and beverage location have historically been approximately twice the sales per square foot of our other domestic full-price retail stores. We believe that the customer immersing themselves into the Tommy Bahama lifestyle by having a meal or a drink at the Tommy Bahama food and beverage location and visiting the adjacent retail store may entice the customer 

11



to purchase additional Tommy Bahama merchandise and potentially provide a memorable consumer experience that further enhances the relationship between Tommy Bahama and the consumer. The Marlin Bar concept, like our traditional restaurant locations, is adjacent to one of our retail locations and serves food and beverages, but in a smaller space and with food options more focused on small plate offerings rather than entrees. We believe that the smaller footprint, reduced labor requirements and lower required capital expenditure of the Marlin Bar concept provides us with the long-term potential for opening additional retail-food and beverage locations that are more in line with evolving customer trends toward fast casual dining, particularly with younger consumers.
For Tommy Bahama’s domestic full-price retail stores and retail-restaurant locations operating for the full Fiscal 2021 year, sales per gross square foot, excluding restaurant sales and restaurant space, were approximately $645, compared to approximately $615 in Fiscal 2019. 
Disposal of discontinued or end of season inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business and Tommy Bahama uses its outlet stores, sales to off-price retailers and selected initial markdowns in our full-price retail stores and on our e-commerce websites to sell its end of season or excess inventory. Our Tommy Bahama outlet stores, which generated 8% of our total Tommy Bahama net sales in Fiscal 2021, are generally located in outlet shopping centers that include other upscale retailers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by often allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties. We believe that this approach has helped us protect the integrity of the Tommy Bahama brand by allowing our full-price retail stores to limit promotional activity while controlling the distribution of discontinued and out-of-season product. To supplement the clearance items sold in Tommy Bahama outlets, we merchandise our Tommy Bahama outlets with some made-for products. Historically, we expected to operate one outlet for approximately every three full-price retail stores, but with the implementation of Tommy Bahama’s Enterprise Order Management (EOM) system in late Fiscal 2020, which by providing a robust ship from store capability reduces the amount of required inventory purchases and also assists with end of season inventory clearance, the number of outlets required for our operations in the future will likely decrease resulting in us planning to close certain outlet stores upon expiration of the current lease term. 
The table below provides certain information regarding Tommy Bahama retail stores and restaurants operated by us as of January 29, 2022.

During Fiscal 2021 Florida, California, Hawaii and Texas represented 27%, 16%, 12% and 9%, respectively, of our Tommy Bahama retail and restaurant sales. 
​
The table below reflects the changes in store count for Tommy Bahama locations during Fiscal 2021.

Closed | | (4) | | — | | (1) | | (5) 
Open as of end of fiscal year | | 102 | | 21 | | 35 | | 158 

​
In future periods, we anticipate that many of our new Tommy Bahama store openings will be Marlin Bar locations that are either new locations or conversions of existing full-price retail stores. Currently, we have one opening scheduled for Fiscal 2022, the conversion of the Tommy Bahama retail location in Palm Beach Gardens in Florida to a Marlin Bar, which is scheduled to open around the end of Fiscal 2022. We continue to look for other appropriate locations for retail stores and Marlin Bars. We believe that in Fiscal 2022, we may close a limited number of locations, including certain outlets and full-price retail locations.
The operation of retail stores, Marlin Bars and retail-restaurant locations requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. The cost of a traditional Tommy Bahama retail-restaurant location and a Marlin Bar is significantly more than the cost of a full-price retail store and can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. Historically, the cost to build out our retail-restaurant locations was approximately $5 million, and the cost to build out our Marlin Bar locations has been approximately $3 million; however, the cost to build out a restaurant and Marlin Bar can vary significantly for certain locations. For most of our retail stores and our retail-food and beverage locations, the landlord often provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs related to periodic remodels of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires, and we determine it is appropriate to relocate to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store. Alternatively, when a lease expires, we may decide to close the store rather than relocating the store to another location or renewing the lease. The capital cost of store relocations is generally comparable to the cost of opening a new location. 
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we continue to maintain our wholesale operations for Tommy Bahama. Tommy Bahama’s wholesale customers include better department stores, specialty stores and multi-brand e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. We value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Tommy Bahama brand within their stores.
Wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama accounted for 15% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2021. Approximately 10% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales reflects sales to major department stores with our remaining wholesale sales primarily to specialty stores. During Fiscal 2021, 11% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales were to Tommy Bahama’s 10 largest wholesale customers, with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales.
We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Tommy Bahama brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution, with careful selection of the retailers through which Tommy Bahama products are sold. As a result of our approach to limiting our wholesale distribution, we believe that sales growth in our men’s apparel wholesale business may be somewhat limited in the long-term. However, 

13



we believe that we may have opportunities for wholesale sales increases for our Tommy Bahama women’s business in the future, with its appeal evidenced by its performance in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites.
Lilly Pulitzer
Lilly Pulitzer designs, sources, markets and distributes upscale collections of women’s and girl’s dresses, sportswear and related products. The Lilly Pulitzer brand was originally created in the late 1950s by Lilly Pulitzer and is an affluent brand with a heritage and aesthetic based on the Palm Beach resort lifestyle. The brand is somewhat unique among women’s brands in that it has demonstrated multi-generational appeal, including among young women in college or recently graduated from college; young mothers with their daughters; and women who are not tied to the academic calendar. Lilly Pulitzer products can be found in our owned Lilly Pulitzer stores, in Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores, which are described below, and on our Lilly Pulitzer website, lillypulitzer.com, as well as in better department and independent specialty stores. During Fiscal 2021, 34%, 34% and 13% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales were for women’s sportswear, dresses, and Luxletic apparel products, respectively, with the remaining sales consisting of Lilly Pulitzer accessories, including scarves, bags, jewelry and belts, children’s apparel, swim, footwear and licensed products. 
We believe that there are opportunities to expand the reach of the Lilly Pulitzer brand in the future, while at the same time maintaining its historically select distribution. We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Lilly Pulitzer brand. These investments include enhancing e-commerce and other technology capabilities; opening and operating full-price retail stores; remodeling and/or relocating existing stores; and increasing headcount, advertising and other functions to support the business. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on Lilly Pulitzer’s operating margin, particularly if there is insufficient sales growth to absorb the incremental costs in a particular year.
We believe the attraction of the Lilly Pulitzer brand to our consumers is a reflection of years of maintaining appropriate quality and design, restricting the distribution of Lilly Pulitzer products to a select tier of retailers and effectively communicating the message of Lilly Pulitzer’s optimistic Palm Beach resort chic lifestyle. We believe this approach to quality, design, distribution and communication has been critical in allowing us to achieve the current retail price points for Lilly Pulitzer products. 
Direct to Consumer Operations
Lilly Pulitzer’s direct to consumer distribution channel, which consists of e-commerce operations and full-price retail stores, represented 84% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2021. A key element of our Lilly Pulitzer strategy is the lillypulitzer.com website, which generated $150 million of net sales, or 50% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales, in Fiscal 2021. Another key component of our Lilly Pulitzer direct to consumer strategy is to operate our own Lilly Pulitzer stores, which represented 34% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2021.
The Lilly Pulitzer e-commerce business has experienced significant growth in recent years, and we anticipate that the net sales growth of the e-commerce business will remain strong in the future. We also use the Lilly Pulitzer website as an effective means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner and at gross margins in excess of 40% via e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales create a significant amount of excitement with loyal Lilly Pulitzer consumers, who are looking for an opportunity to purchase Lilly Pulitzer products at a discounted price and are also important in attracting new consumers to the Lilly Pulitzer brand. These e-commerce flash clearance sales typically run for three days during the summer clearance period in September and for two days during the post-holiday clearance period in January, allowing the Lilly Pulitzer website to generally remain full-price for the remaining 360 days of the year. During Fiscal 2021, 21% of Lilly Pulitzer’s e-commerce sales, and 11% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales, were e-commerce flash clearance sales. 
Our Lilly Pulitzer retail stores permit us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting Lilly Pulitzer products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which they are based. Our retail store strategy for the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes operating full-price retail stores in higher-end lifestyle shopping centers and malls, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. As of January 29, 2022, about 40% of our Lilly Pulitzer 

14



stores were located in outdoor regional lifestyle centers and approximately one-third of our Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in indoor regional malls, with the remaining locations in resort or street locations. In certain seasonal locations such as Nantucket and Watch Hill, our stores are only open during the resort season. Additionally, we may open temporary pop-up stores in certain locations.
Lilly Pulitzer’s full-price retail store sales per gross square foot for Fiscal 2021 were approximately $685 for the full-price retail stores which were open the full Fiscal 2021 year, as compared to $720 for Fiscal 2019. 
The table below provides certain information regarding Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores as of January 29, 2022.

​
Currently, we expect to open three new retail locations in Fiscal 2022, including Alpharetta, Georgia and Charlottesville, Virginia. Also, we are identifying sites or negotiating leases for other retail store locations and will continue to look for other appropriate locations in the future. We believe that in Fiscal 2022, we may close a limited number of locations at lease expiration. The operation of full-price retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. 
In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels or expansions of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We may also incur capital expenditures if we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location. The capital cost of store relocations, if any, will generally be comparable to the cost of opening a new store. 
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we maintain wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer. These wholesale operations are primarily with Signature Stores, independent specialty stores, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. During Fiscal 2021, 16% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales were sales to wholesale 

15



customers. During Fiscal 2021, about one-third of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales were to Lilly Pulitzer’s Signature Stores, one-fifth of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales were to specialty stores and about one-fifth of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales, or less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales, were to department stores. The remaining wholesale sales were primarily to national accounts, including on-line retailers, and off-price retailers. Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales to its 10 largest wholesale customers represented 8% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2021 with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales.
An important part of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For these stores, we enter into agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all floor space specifically for Lilly Pulitzer products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. We sell products to these Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of January 29, 2022, there were 49 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores.
We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Lilly Pulitzer products are sold. We continue to value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand within their stores. 
Southern Tide
Southern Tide designs, sources, markets and distributes high-quality apparel bearing the distinctive Skipjack logo. Southern Tide offers an extensive selection of men’s shirts, pants, shorts, outerwear, ties, swimwear, footwear and accessories, as well as women’s and youth collections. Launched in 2006, Southern Tide combines the modern design elements of today’s youthful trends with love for the Southern culture and lifestyle. The brand has an appeal to all ages who have an appreciation for classic design, vibrant colors and a great fit and an affection for the coast. Southern Tide products can be found at independent specialty retailers, better department stores, Southern Tide Signature Stores which are described below, our Southern Tide website, southerntide.com, and our four Southern Tide retail stores. During Fiscal 2021, 67% of Southern Tide’s sales were wholesale sales, 26% of Southern Tide’s sales were e-commerce sales and 7% of Southern Tide’s sales were retail store sales.
We believe that there is significant opportunity to expand the reach of the Southern Tide brand by further increasing the wholesale presence of the brand and growing the direct to consumer business including e-commerce and retail sales. We believe that wholesale growth and expansion will be at a prudent pace as we believe that the integrity and success of the Southern Tide brand is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Southern Tide products are sold. We anticipate that the direct to consumer operations will grow at a faster pace than wholesale operations fueled by the addition of more owned Southern Tide retail stores in future years, as well as continued growth in our Southern Tide e-commerce operations. We opened the first owned Southern Tide retail store in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2019, and as of January 29, 2022, had four retail stores, all located in Florida, with an average of 1,800 square feet per store.
We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Southern Tide brand. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments, including retail store operating costs, may have a short-term, negative impact on Southern Tide’s operating margin given the current size of the Southern Tide business. 
Wholesale Operations
At this time, 67% of Southern Tide’s business is a wholesale business with sales to independent specialty stores, department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores. Southern Tide’s wholesale operations provide an opportunity to grow our business and have access to a large base of consumers. During Fiscal 2021, approximately 19% and 8% of Southern Tide’s sales were to department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores, respectively. Southern Tide’s net sales to its 10 largest wholesale customers represented 32% of Southern Tide’s net sales in Fiscal 2021, with its largest customer representing 16% of Southern Tide’s net sales.

16



A component of Southern Tide’s wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For Signature Stores, we enter into license agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Southern Tide Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all floor space specifically for Southern Tide products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. We sell products to these Southern Tide Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of January 29, 2022, there were 14 Signature Stores including stores in Florida, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Georgia and Connecticut. We anticipate some additional Signature Stores opening in the future. In addition, we believe there is opportunity for wholesale growth for Southern Tide in women’s apparel, which represented 18% of Southern Tide’s net sales in Fiscal 2021.
Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Southern Tide growth strategy is to expand our direct to consumer operations, which consists of the Southern Tide website and retail store operations. The Southern Tide website markets a full line of merchandise, including apparel and accessories, all presented in a manner intended to enhance the Southern Tide image, brand awareness and acceptance. We believe our Southern Tide website enables us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. In addition to off-price retailers, we also use the Southern Tide website as a means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner. During the year, we have a number of e-commerce clearance sales events, which are typically in industry end of season promotional periods.
In Fiscal 2019, we opened our first owned Southern Tide retail store in Jacksonville, Florida. In Fiscal 2020, we opened retail stores in Fort Lauderdale and Miramar Beach, Florida, and in Fiscal 2021, we opened a store in Islamorada, Florida. In Fiscal 2022, we plan to open stores in Cary, North Carolina, in Estero, Florida and on 30A on the Florida panhandle. We continue to look at additional opportunities for new store locations. 
The operation of full-price retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We anticipate that most future full-price retail store openings will generally be approximately 2,000 square feet on average; however, the determination of actual size of the store will depend on a variety of criteria. We anticipate that for most of our full-price retail stores, the landlord will provide certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
Lanier Apparel
In Fiscal 2020, we decided to exit our Lanier Apparel business. This decision aligns with our stated business strategy of developing and marketing compelling lifestyle brands. It also took into consideration the increased macroeconomic challenges faced by the Lanier Apparel business, many of which were magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The exit of the Lanier Apparel business was completed in Fiscal 2021. 
In Fiscal 2021, Lanier Apparel’s net sales were $25 million and represented 2% of our consolidated net sales. In Fiscal 2020, Lanier Apparel’s net sales were $39 million and represented 5% of our consolidated net sales. In connection with the exit of the Lanier Apparel business, we recorded pre-tax charges of $13 million in the Lanier Apparel operating group during Fiscal 2020 and a pre-tax benefit of $2 million in Fiscal 2021. The Lanier Apparel exit charges are discussed in Note 11 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We do not expect any revenues, or additional exit charges related to the Lanier Apparel business after Fiscal 2021.
Lanier Apparel designed, sourced and distributed branded and private label men’s apparel, primarily consisting of tailored clothing and casual pants, across a wide range of price points, but primarily at moderate price points. The moderate price point tailored clothing market has been an extremely competitive sector for years, with significant retail competition as well as increasing gross margin pressures due to retail sales price pressures and production cost increases. The majority of our Lanier Apparel products were historically sold under certain trademarks licensed to us by third parties including Kenneth Cole®, Dockers®, Cole Haan® and Nick Graham®. Additionally, we designed and marketed certain products for brands owned by us and private label apparel products for customers. Lanier Apparel products were sold through large retailers including department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and others.

Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, the elimination of inter-segment sales and any other items that are not allocated to the operating groups including LIFO accounting adjustments. Because our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the operating groups. Corporate and Other also includes the operations of other businesses which are not included in our four operating groups. The operations of TBBC, Duck Head and our Lyons, Georgia distribution center are included in Corporate and Other. TBBC designs, sources, markets and distributes premium childrenswear including bonnets, hats, apparel, swimwear and accessories through the TBBC e-commerce website, thebeaufortbonnetcompany.com, as well as wholesale specialty retailers and its first retail store which opened in January 2022. Duck Head designs, sources, markets and distributes premium men’s apparel including pants, shorts and tops through wholesale specialty retailers and the Duck Head e-commerce website, duckhead.com. 
TRADEMARKS
We own trademarks, many of which are very important and valuable to our business, including Tommy Bahama®, Lilly Pulitzer®, Southern Tide®, The Beaufort Bonnet Company® and Duck Head®. Generally, our trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on apparel and, in some cases, apparel-related products, accessories, home furnishings and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services. We continue to evaluate our worldwide usage and registration of our trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services in the relevant jurisdiction and the required registration renewals are filed. Important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
During Fiscal 2021, we incurred $60 million, or 5% of net sales, of advertising expense. Advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy for our lifestyle brands, and we therefore devote significant resources to these efforts. Thus, we believe that it is very important that our brands communicate regularly with consumers about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen connections with consumers. Our advertising emphasizes the respective brand’s image and lifestyle and attempts to engage individuals within the target consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our e-commerce websites, retail stores or wholesale customers’ stores and websites in search of our products. 
We increasingly utilize digital marketing, social media and email, as well as traditional direct mail communications, to interact with consumers. Our marketing may also include sponsorships, collaborations, and co-branding initiatives, which may be for a particular cause or non-profit organization that is expected to resonate with target consumers.
We vary our engagement tactics to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, drive conversion, build loyalty, activate consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Our creative marketing teams design and produce imagery and content, social media strategies, email and print campaigns designed to drive traffic to our direct to consumer locations and websites as well as to increase influencer amplification. We attempt to increase our brand awareness through a strategic emphasis on technology and the elevation of our digital presence which encompasses e-commerce, mobile e-commerce, digital media, social media and influencer marketing. We are also investing in analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels. We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g. loyalty, ratings and reviews and mobile phone applications) and build brand equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on consumer behaviors and has accelerated the trend for a digital first consumer. This provided a catalyst for accelerating the implementation of new direct to consumer business models and consumer engagement programs, such as selling through social media.

18



Marketing initiatives in our direct to consumer operations may include special event promotions, including loyalty award card, Flip Side, Friends & Family and gift with purchase events and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our brands and products, drive traffic to our websites and stores, convert new consumers and increase demand and loyalty. Our various initiatives are effective in increasing online and in-store traffic resulting in the proportion of our sales that occur during our marketing initiatives increasing in recent years, which puts some downward pressure on our direct to consumer gross margins. 
We believe that highly visible full-price retail store locations with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit and buy merchandise. We believe that full-price retail stores attract new consumers and enhance the shopping experience of our existing customers, which will increase consumer brand loyalty, our net sales and sales of our products by our wholesale customers. 
For certain of our wholesale customers, we may also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs. 
PRODUCT DESIGN
We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value, and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. Our ability to compete successfully in the apparel industry is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.
Each of our lifestyle brands’ products are designed and developed by dedicated brand-specific teams who focus on the target consumer for the respective brand. The design process includes feedback from buyers, consumers and sales agents, along with market trend research. Our apparel products generally incorporate fabrics made of cotton, silk, linen, nylon, leather, tencel and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials. 
PRODUCT SOURCING
We intend to maintain flexible, diversified, cost-effective sourcing operations that provide high-quality apparel and related products. Our operating groups, either internally, using in-house employees located in the United States and/or Hong Kong, or through the use of third party buying agents, manage the production and sourcing of substantially all of our apparel and related products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries. 
Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers of apparel and related products and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. Instead, we conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Thus, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality, cost, timing of product delivery and other criteria. During Fiscal 2021, we purchased our products from approximately 250 suppliers, with a significant concentration of suppliers in Asia, with the 10 largest suppliers providing approximately 30% of our product purchases. During Fiscal 2021, no individual third party manufacturer, licensee or other supplier provided more than 10% of our product purchases in total or for our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer operating groups. We generally acquire products sold in our restaurant operations from various third party domestic suppliers, with a particular emphasis on procuring sustainably sourced food and locally grown produce.
During Fiscal 2021 approximately 38%, 23%, and 11% of our apparel and related products acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China, Vietnam and Peru, respectively, with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. For Fiscal 2021, the percentage of products sourced from China for our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer operating groups were 49% and 23%, respectively. We expect that the percentage of our products sourced from producers located in China will decrease in the future. While we are working to diversify our 

19



supplier base and reduce the concentration of manufacturing from China in the future, the majority of fibers included in our apparel and other products currently originate in China even if the products are manufactured elsewhere.
We purchase substantially all of our apparel and related products from third party producers as package purchases of finished goods, which are manufactured with oversight by us or our third party buying agents and to our design and fabric specifications. The use of contract manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us, as operating manufacturing facilities requires a significant amount of capital investment, labor and oversight. We depend on third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of specified raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. We believe that purchasing substantially all of our products as package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we are not required to purchase, or finance the purchase of, the raw materials or other production costs related to our apparel and related product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods, which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers. 
As the manufacture and transportation of apparel and related products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season, we typically make commitments, and our wholesale accounts place orders with us, months in advance of when products will arrive in our retail stores or our wholesale customers’ stores. We continue to seek ways to reduce the time required from design and ordering to bringing products to our customers. As our merchandising departments must estimate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own retail stores and e-commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors, and as purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to prior to the receipt of customer orders, we carry the risk that we have purchased more inventory than will ultimately be desired or that we will not have purchased sufficient inventory to satisfy demand, resulting in lost sales opportunities.
As part of our commitment to source our products in a lawful, ethical and socially responsible manner, each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors from whom we purchase apparel and related products, which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business or ethical standards, including related human rights, health, safety, working conditions, environmental and other requirements. We require that each of our vendors and licensees comply with the applicable code of conduct or substantially similar compliance standards. All of our vendors from whom we purchase goods are also required by us to adhere to the United States Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program, including standards relating to facility, procedural, personnel and cargo security. 
On an ongoing basis we assess vendors’ compliance with the applicable code of conduct and applicable laws and regulations through audits performed by either our employees or our designated agents. We periodically review each tier 1 supplier’s compliance with our requirements and conduct social compliance audits more frequently depending on the severity of issues identified and the cooperation received during remediation. In Fiscal 2021, we conducted 138 risk assessments (including 80 surveys targeting forced labor risks) and 63 onsite audits of our tier 1 suppliers (including 40 full audits and 23 follow-up audits). Approximately 30% of onsite audits in Fiscal 2021 were conducted by a third party auditor. In the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by our required standards, we work with the vendor to remediate the violation. If the violation is not satisfactorily remediated, we will discontinue use of the vendor. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
We believe that as a leading apparel company, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact and make the world a better place for all people. Our Board is ultimately charged with overseeing the risks to our business on behalf of our shareholders, and we believe that our Board’s active involvement in oversight of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives affords us tremendous benefits. We report routinely to our Board and/or various Board committees about ESG risks and strategies and communicate insights provided by our directors to our brands to assist in formulating ESG goals and initiatives. Within our Corporate team, we have a cross-functional steering committee comprised of our Vice President of Operations, our Vice President of Human Resources, our General Counsel, and our Senior Director of Strategic Planning and Business Development who, with input from our Executive Leadership Team, assess ESG opportunities within our industry and collaborate with our brands on potential opportunities to execute brand-specific ESG initiatives.

Reducing our Footprint
Our business operations – throughout the value chain – impact the environment, and we are committed to identifying and executing commercially viable environmental sustainability initiatives to further a safer, more sustainable world for the generations that follow us. Our brands are continuously working to improve sustainability in store and restaurant design and operations, and we have also undertaken efforts to implement sustainability measures at our offices and distribution centers. For example, we have made targeted efforts to ensure that new store buildouts are more sustainable and replaced all sales floor lighting with LED lighting in our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores. Within Tommy Bahama, we have eliminated metal clips, eliminated tissue use and transitioned to packaging materials that contain a minimum of 40% recycled content. Each of our corporate offices and distribution centers implements recycling programs for materials such as paper, plastic, glass and aluminum. 
​
Increasing our use of sustainable materials is and will continue to be a key priority, and we are excited to introduce products crafted from sustainable materials. For example, this Spring, we launched the Tommy Bahama Palm ModernTM line of women’s swimwear, made with 75% recycled nylon. At Southern Tide, we reintroduced the Shoreline shorts, beloved by customers for their versatility and comfort, in 100% recycled materials. Within our businesses, we also seek to use preferred materials that are more environmentally responsible than their conventional counterparts like LENZINGTM, ECOVEROTM Viscose and TENCELTM Modal and raw materials that are certified to the Global Organic Textile Standard or Global Recycled Standard.
​
Our operating groups also maintain and enforce restricted substances lists, which are informed by the American Apparel & Footwear Association Environmental Task Force restricted substances list, to ensure that the use of chemicals in our products complies with all applicable legal and safety requirements.
​
We participate in various trade initiatives and organizations to better inform ourselves about risks, opportunities and best practices. We are a proud member of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), and all of our brands are signatories to the “Commitment to Responsible Recruiting” sponsored by the AAFA and the Fair Labor Association. Our Tommy Bahama business is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, and within our organization, we have membership in Better Cotton and partnerships with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and FSC-certified suppliers.
Empowering our People
​
We believe that our long-term success as an organization relies on recruiting, developing, promoting and rewarding the best and most talented people within our industry. Diversity and inclusion are key components of our corporate responsibility framework, and we are committed to creating a culture where people have a sense of belonging and purpose to maximize their fullest potential. For more information about our workforce and diversity and inclusion initiatives, please refer to Part I, Item 1, Business—Human Capital Management.
​
Enriching our Communities
​
Since our founding in 1942, we have prided ourselves on being model citizens for the communities in which we operate. We focus our community initiatives on programs that can impact a broad set of constituents where we operate. Our community partners include the United Way of Greater Atlanta, the Woodruff Arts Center and Grady Hospital, and each of our operating groups partners with organizations improving quality of life in the communities where our customers and employees live and work, such as the Garden of Hope and Courage, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Folds of Honor and the Kentucky Children’s Hospital. 
​
In 2020, we announced the launch of the Oxford Educational Access Initiative to further our goal of reducing economic and racial inequality through access to education. We believe that every child, regardless of race or economic circumstance, deserves the chance to learn and be successful. Over the course of four years beginning in 2021, we will give $1 million to community organizations with innovative program models that address a broad spectrum of educational challenges that children in underserved communities face. Each of our brands has selected recipient 

21



organizations that are working to address disparities in educational access and barriers to success for children in our local communities.
​
IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
We are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations as substantially all of our merchandise, as well as the products purchased by our licensing partners, is manufactured by foreign suppliers. During Fiscal 2021, approximately 38%, 23% and 11% of our apparel and related products acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China, Vietnam and Peru, respectively, with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. Products imported by us, or imported by others and ultimately sold to us, are subject to customs, trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the United States and other countries where we sell our products, including various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern any of our activities that may have adverse environmental, health and safety effects. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant monetary penalties.
Substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to certain duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product. These amounts represent a component of the inventories we sell and are included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations. We paid total duties of more than $35 million on products imported into the United States directly by us in Fiscal 2021, with the average duty rate on those products of approximately 17% of the value of the imported product in Fiscal 2021. Duty rates vary depending on the type of garment, fiber content and country of origin and are subject to change in future periods. In addition, while the World Trade Organization’s member nations have eliminated quotas on apparel and textiles, the United States and other countries into which we import our products are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose "anti-dumping" or "countervailing" duties in response to threats to their comparable domestic industries.
Although we have not been materially inhibited from sourcing products from desired markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets. In recent years the United States government has implemented additional duties on certain product categories across various industries. It is possible that additional duty increases could occur in future years, which could have a significant unfavorable impact on the apparel retail industry and our cost of goods sold, operations, net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment, including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products. As a result of these changes and increased costs of production in certain countries that unfavorably impact our cost of goods sold, we continue to make changes in our supply chain, including exiting certain factories and sourcing those products from a factory in a different foreign country. 
In addition, apparel and other related products sold by us are subject to stringent and complex product performance and security and safety standards, laws and other regulations. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, certification of product safety and importer security procedures. We believe that we are in material compliance with those regulations. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also generally subject to such regulations.
Important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS
We operate three distribution centers, with each operating group generally serviced by one distribution center. Our Auburn, Washington, and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania distribution centers serve our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer operating groups, respectively. Our Lyons, Georgia distribution center provides primary distribution services for our smaller Southern Tide, TBBC and Duck Head businesses, as well as certain distribution services for our Lilly Pulitzer and Tommy Bahama businesses. In Fiscal 2021, we sold our Toccoa, Georgia distribution center, which previously serviced our Lanier Apparel operating group, which we exited in Fiscal 2021.

22



Activities at the distribution centers include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to our retail store, e-commerce and wholesale customers, each as applicable. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory at the distribution centers to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked, at-once and some in-stock replenishment orders for our wholesale customers. We use a local third party distribution center for our Tommy Bahama Australia operations.
In Fiscal 2021, 80% of our net sales were direct to consumer sales, which are filled on a current basis; accordingly, an order backlog is not material to our business. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
We believe that sophisticated information systems and functionality are important components of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses, particularly in the ever-changing consumer shopping environment. Our information systems are designed to provide effective retail store, e-commerce, restaurant and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point-of-sale, distribution center, design, sourcing, order processing, marketing, customer relationship management, accounting and other functions. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies, to provide additional consumer access and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business. We believe that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency, functionality and reporting capabilities is critical to our operations and financial condition.
LICENSING AGREEMENTS
We license the Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide trademarks to licensees in categories beyond our brands’ core product categories. We believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for our larger lifestyle brands. Once a brand is more fully established, licensing typically requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In evaluating a licensee for our brands, we consider the candidate’s experience, financial stability, sourcing expertise and marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed licensed products with our own products.
Our agreements with our licensees are brand specific, relate to specific geographic areas and have expirations at various dates in the future, with contingent renewal options in limited cases. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty payments based on specified percentages of the licensee’s net sales of the licensed products as well as certain obligations for advertising and marketing. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution.

We license the Tommy Bahama brand for a broad range of product categories including indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, beach chairs, bedding and bath linens, fabrics, leather goods and gifts, headwear, hosiery, sleepwear, shampoo, toiletries, fragrances, cigar accessories, distilled spirits and other products. Third party license arrangements for Lilly Pulitzer products include stationery and gift products; home furnishing products; and eyewear. We currently license the Southern Tide trademark to licensees for certain bed and bath product categories. 
In addition to our license arrangements for the specific product categories listed above, we may enter into certain international distributor agreements which allow those parties to distribute apparel and other products on a wholesale and/or retail basis within certain countries or regions. As of January 29, 2022, we have agreements for the distribution of Tommy Bahama products in the Middle East and parts of Latin America. The products sold by the distributors generally are identical to the products sold in our own Tommy Bahama stores. In addition to selling Tommy Bahama goods to wholesale accounts, the distributors may, in some cases, operate a limited number of their own retail stores. None of these international distributor agreements are expected to generate growth that would materially impact our operating results in the near term.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS
Each of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. As a result, our quarterly operating results and working capital requirements fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Typically, the demand for products for our larger brands is higher in the spring, summer and holiday seasons and lower in the fall season (the third quarter of our fiscal year). Thus, our third quarter historically has the lowest net sales and net earnings compared to other quarters. Further, the impact of the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, weather or other factors affecting our operations may vary from one year to the next. Therefore, we do not believe that net sales or operating income by quarter in Fiscal 2021 are necessarily indicative of the expected distribution in Fiscal 2022 or future periods, in light of, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic’s more significant negative impact on the first quarter in Fiscal 2021.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Our key strategy is to own brands that make people happy, and we recognize that successful execution of our strategy starts with people. We believe treating people fairly and with respect is key to long-term success and, more importantly, is simply the right thing to do.
As of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 4,700 individuals globally, more than 95% of whom were in the United States. Approximately 70% of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees. Our employee base fluctuates during the year, as we typically hire seasonal employees to support our retail store and restaurant operations, primarily during the holiday selling season. None of our employees as of January 29, 2022 was represented by a union.

Commitment to Human Rights and our Code of Conduct
​
We are committed to respecting human rights in our business operations, including throughout our supply chain and product life cycle. As part of our supplier audit processes, we conduct human rights due diligence to identify risks and work to mitigate them, and our supplier codes of conduct set forth minimum social responsibility requirements to ensure that the human rights of all people in our value chain are respected. We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, violence or retaliation of any kind. 
​
Our Code of Conduct applies to all employees, officers and directors in our organization and addresses, among other topics, compliance with laws, avoiding conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, bribery and kickbacks, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment and reporting misconduct. Our General Counsel takes responsibility for reviewing and refreshing our Code of Conduct; educating our team members about our expectations; and, as applicable, enforcing the Code of Conduct. All employees at the time of hire are required to read and certify compliance with the Code of Conduct and are given an opportunity to ask questions. In addition, our General Counsel targets live trainings with

management-level employees about the expectations and requirements set forth in our Code of Conduct at least every three years.

Talent and Development
We are always looking for great people to join our team. We recognize that in order to remain competitive, we must attract, develop and retain top caliber employees in our design, marketing, merchandising, information technology and other functions, as well as in our retail stores, restaurants and distribution centers. Competition for talented employees is intense. 
In furtherance of attracting and retaining employees committed to our core values and business strategy, we maintain competitive compensation programs that include a variety of components, including competitive pay consistent with skill level, experience and knowledge, as well as comprehensive benefit plans consisting of health and welfare plans, retirement benefits and paid leave for our employee base in the United States. 
In 2018, we launched an ongoing initiative to assess how well we are doing in managing performance, developing our people and putting our talent to its highest and best use across our company. Our aim is greater employee engagement and ultimately a more effective organization. As part of our commitment to our people, throughout our brands and businesses, we provide employees with training, growth and development opportunities, including on-the-job training, learning and development programs, and other educational programs. Outside of the United States, we work with outside partners familiar with the local markets and laws to ensure our rewards are competitive within that jurisdiction and support employee well-being. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining a clean, safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees. We continue to carefully monitor guidelines published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention with respect to COVID-19 and have continued to implement safety protocols consistent with applicable guidance and local requirements. We continue to review, monitor and revise our protocols, as appropriate. 
Diversity & Inclusion
Our ongoing commitment to having the best people includes a commitment to equal opportunity. We believe in a diverse and inclusive workplace that respects and invites differing ideas and perspective. We have a number of initiatives to ensure that our hiring, retention and advancement practices promote fair and equal opportunities across our workforce and ensure that we will have the best people in the industry to support our businesses going forward.
Our diversity and inclusion strategies begin at the recruiting stage, where we seek to attract and hire the most qualified candidates possible, without regard to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, genetics or other protected characteristics. We reinforce our values and goals through our Code of Conduct and other workplace policies, with an anonymous, confidential ethics hotline that allows our employees to voice concerns. We also seek to ensure that our pay and rewards programs and advancement opportunities are consistent with our culture of equality.
As of January 29, 2022, our domestic workforce, which comprised over 95% of our employee population, was self-disclosed as 38% male, 62% female and less than 1% undisclosed or choosing not to identify. Among our management employees, who comprise approximately 17% of our workforce, the self-disclosed figures were 32% male, 68% female and less than 1% undisclosed or choosing not to identify. As of January 29, 2022, the self-disclosed ethnicity of our workforce was 61% white (not Hispanic or Latino) and 39% non-white, whereas for management employees, the self-disclosed ethnicity figures were 76% white (not Hispanic or Latino) and 24% non-white. 
Notably, while our overall headcount increased from the end of Fiscal 2020 to the end of Fiscal 2021, our total population of non-white employees increased year-over-year by 24% relative to a 16% increase in white employees. Similarly, we saw an 11% increase in non-white management employees over the course of Fiscal 2021 relative to a 2% increase in white management employees.
