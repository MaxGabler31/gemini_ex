Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Squarespace is an all-in-one platform with everything to sell anything, providing customers in over 200 countries and territories with all the tools they need to sell physical products, digital content, classes, appointments, reservations and more. Powered by best-in-class design for a consistent brand experience across all touchpoints, our suite of fully integrated products enables anyone to manage their projects and businesses through websites, domains, e-commerce, marketing tools, and scheduling, along with tools for managing a social media presence with Unfold and hospitality services via Tock.
Consumer behavior continues to rapidly evolve in conjunction with changes in the internet and technology, and the amount of time and money consumers spend online is accelerating. As consumers increasingly engage with companies online to learn about and transact with new brands, the marketplace for consumer attention is intensely competitive. It is mission-critical for brands to differentiate themselves with a beautiful and effective online presence. Businesses and independent creators need a way to develop an impactful, professional-quality presence quickly and cost-effectively that also enables them to transact directly with their customer base.
The Squarespace platform empowers our customers to build, manage and grow compelling brands online. We bring together three primary pillars of functionality to create a unified, all-in-one platform to help our customers grow:
•Presence:   Our intuitive design tools make it possible to quickly and easily create a professional-quality, mobile and desktop friendly website, acquire a domain and have a differentiated social media presence. Since our founding, we have aggressively invested in our design and creative teams in an effort to create innovative, forward-thinking website designs that ensure our customers’ websites are seen as among the most sophisticated on the web.
•Commerce:   Through our comprehensive commerce solutions, we provide our customers everything they need to sell physical products, subscriptions, content or services online. Our commerce functionality is fully integrated with our presence products, eliminating the need for third-party tools.
•Marketing:   We provide brands with powerful, integrated marketing solutions, such as Email Campaigns, customer relationship management functionality, SEO and analytics tools to help them better understand and target their audiences while driving traffic, sales and conversion.
Squarespace is an engineering and design-led company and our platform features a modern architecture, scalable delivery platform and secure solutions that provide support for our global customer base. The Squarespace platform works for customers that are just getting started, as well as large brands that need scale, providing flexibility and reliability.
In addition to servicing customers from inception to at-scale, our customers span a wide variety of industries and use cases, from small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) and independent creators, such as restaurants, photographers, wedding planners, artists, musicians and bloggers, to iconic brands. As of December 31, 2021, we had 4.1 million unique subscriptions to our platform.
We believe we have created a highly-efficient and multi-pronged go-to-market model that enables us to capitalize on our market opportunity and acquire customers in a cost effective manner. We believe we have a stable and predictable business model driven by efficient customer acquisition and the adoption by our customers over time of higher value offerings and add-on subscriptions. We generated in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
•revenue of $784.0 million and $621.1 million;
•net (loss)/income of $(249.1) million and $30.6 million;
•adjusted EBITDA of $125.1 million and $116.7 million;
•net cash provided by operating activities of $123.2 million and $150.0 million; and
•unlevered free cash flow of $122.4 million and $152.4 million.

The Key Benefits of our Platform
Squarespace has solidified its position as a go-to premium offering for online presence and commerce. Our comprehensive, integrated platform provides a unified experience for our customers. The key tenets of our platform are:
•Beautiful Design, Consistent Everywhere:   We believe design is not a luxury. Our beautifully-designed, award-winning templates enable our customers to look professional from the start, while also providing deep levels of customization so that no two websites look alike. This empowers our customers to stand out and express their story and brand in a beautiful, engaging and consistent way across digital channels, including websites, social media and Email Campaigns, among others.
•Everything to Sell Anything:   Our commerce solution supports a diverse set of business models, allowing our customers to sell physical products, subscriptions, content and services within the same platform. For example, a fitness instructor can market their brand professionally online and their clients can book personal training sessions through their website, attend virtual classes and buy custom apparel, all powered on the Squarespace platform.
•Power with Simplicity:   Our platform balances ease-of-use with a deep level of functionality required to run more complex businesses. Our platform is also accessible from anywhere — customers can update their website or manage their business on-the-go using our web application or our iPhone and Android applications.
•All-in-One Platform:   Our all-in-one platform offers businesses and independent creators everything they need to build and manage their online presence and commerce across devices and social media. Our fully-integrated SaaS-based content management solution combines a website builder, a commerce solution, social presence and blogging infrastructure, a hosting service, a domain name registrar, marketing tools and differentiated analytics across digital channels. This comprehensive approach enables customers to aggregate and analyze data across solutions to help our customers better understand their audience and drive higher traffic, sales and conversion through a single interface.
•Built for Modern Use Cases:   Our platform can adapt quickly to emerging channels and technology. For example, Unfold provides easy-to-use tools that empower storytellers to differentiate their content and brand on social media. With elevated design collections and intuitive photo and video editing, Unfold helps our customers look great beyond their websites. We aim to establish a foothold with the next generation of independent creators, because we understand that not all journeys may begin with a website.
•Our Customer Support:   We supplement our all-in-one platform with customer service delivered by a global team of in-house product and operations specialists. To serve our worldwide customer base, we are available 24/7/365 through multiple channels of communication, including live chat, email and social. We address the diverse needs of our customers in six languages across eight time zones.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that there is a meaningful opportunity to empower individuals and businesses to succeed by providing several offerings, including web presence, commerce and marketing. Based on data from Intuit, as of 2020, there are an estimated 800 million SMBs and self-employed ventures worldwide. According to Barclays research, the global web tools total addressable market is approximately $350 billion based on the addressable markets of traditional web tools plus inventory management, pick-pack-ship and third-party logistics, Point of Sale devices and integration, accounting, tax, human resources, information technology ticketing and other software solutions. We believe global spending on e-commerce is set to accelerate, the International Data Corporation (“IDC”) projects the size of the digital commerce application market to grow to $9.9 billion in 2025.
In response to this accelerating growth, we continue to innovate and add new services and features that create incremental opportunities to further penetrate as well as expand our core addressable market through new use cases and entry points. Broader e-commerce growth and the increased prevalence of consumers transacting online create demand for our core web presence and commerce tools in addition to generating additional monetization opportunities through other features we offer, including online scheduling, exclusive Member Areas to promote and protect premium content and Email Campaigns. We believe the growth of SMBs and proliferation of commerce, both domestically and internationally, will continue to drive our market opportunity and unlock new monetization opportunities for our platform. We see this as

just the beginning in a long journey between Squarespace and our user community, helping to define commerce and engagement in a digital world.
Our Growth Strategies
We exist to help people with creative ideas stand out and succeed. We want to be the all-in- one platform for every business and independent creator around the world that wants to establish an online presence. To that end, we are pursuing the following growth strategies:
•Expand Our New Customer Base, Especially Internationally:   We aim to continue to deploy offerings across the globe, both in English and non-English speaking regions, in order to continue to diversify and accelerate our growth. As of December 31, 2021, we currently serve customers in over 200 countries and territories and approximately 30% of our bookings are from outside of the United States. We support eight languages, with English, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese available for the creation of websites and Dutch and Swedish available for website translation, and we intend to continue to invest internationally and localize our product offerings. We believe there is significant growth potential within international markets. We intend to continue investment in strategic marketing across brand, direct response and unpaid channels in order to deepen overall brand awareness and attract businesses and individuals seeking to establish an online presence.
•Expand and Deepen our Commerce Offerings:   Our comprehensive commerce offerings provide our customers with everything to sell anything online, while also attracting a differentiated set of commerce-oriented brands to our platform. We intend to continue to expand our commerce capabilities through the development of solutions that enable new ways for our customers to transact online. We also believe that ongoing investment in our partner ecosystem and integrations will allow us to deliver more value to our customers, further increasing adoption of e-commerce functionality. As we continue to scale our platform, both to more use cases and geographically, we intend to integrate partners in extensible commerce functions such as international payments and tax solutions.
•Continued Investment in our Design Platform:   Design is fundamental to our brand and permeates not just our customer templates but our user experience and marketing messages. We integrate designers with our product and engineering teams from the outset to ensure that we weave our design sensibility into everything we do. We expect to continue to invest in our core design platform and technology to ensure that we maintain our position as a leader of web design.
•Deepen Relationships with Existing Customers:   As we continue to innovate and broaden our suite of solutions, we believe that we create significant incremental opportunities to partner with our customers and serve more of their needs. We plan to further invest in offerings that will enable our customers to grow their businesses by using more of our products and features, including Scheduling, exclusive Member Areas and Email Campaigns. We supplement our all-in-one platform with customer service delivered by a global team of in-house product and operations specialists. To serve our worldwide customer base, we are available 24/7/365 through multiple channels of communication including live chat, email and social.
•Promote and Develop our Enterprise Capabilities:   Enterprise includes both larger businesses looking to build an online presence and volume customers who may require scalable solutions for many websites. For example, an agriculture e-commerce company relies on our enterprise solutions to power hundreds of websites for independent farmers to market and sell products. We offer dedicated, prioritized support to ensure they are able to fully leverage our all-in-one platform.
•Expand our Experts Community:   Squarespace is host to a large community of experts that build sites for others on our platform. Squarespace Experts are experienced third-party designers and developers, often part of our Circle community, that are vetted by us for their years of experience and quality of work. We believe that this community provides us with a unique marketing channel to address the steadily growing DIFM website development industry. We provide these experts with knowledge, tools and support that they leverage to find clients and grow their businesses. This community also gives us a powerful feedback loop when we are testing new functionality or making adjustments to our platform.
•Opportunistically Pursue Strategic Acquisitions:   In March 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tock and previously completed and integrated three strategic acquisitions: Acuity, an end-to-end scheduling service provider, in April 2019; Videolicious, a provider of video creation solutions, in August 2019; and Unfold, a social toolkit for storytellers, in October 2019. We believe that future strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate key platform, product and marketing initiatives, and augment our organic growth strategy.

Commerce
Squarespace provides tools for customers to transact in the ways that work best for their businesses.
•Commerce:   Squarespace offers deep e-commerce functionality in our integrated platform. Our easy-to-customize and award-winning designs help our customers sell more by making them look better.

•SEO:   Every Squarespace website and online store comes optimized to be indexed and found online, with a suite of integrated features and guides that help maximize prominence among search results.

Everything on the Squarespace platform is optimized to be found online with no third-party plugins required.
•Analytics:   We have developed our own custom analytics solution that incorporates data from our website, commerce and email solutions into a single view for our customers. Without an integrated platform, customers would be forced to use multiple third-party tools, resulting in a fragmented view of their data across multiple systems.

Managed Infrastructure:   We take care of site hosting, software upgrades, network connectivity, content delivery network deployment and DNS on behalf of our customers to simplify the complexities of running a modern website.

Security and DDoS Mitigation:   We securely host our customers’ websites and defend against DDoS attacks on their behalf, which have the ability to impact network resources and services of our customers.

Our Customers
Squarespace serves customers of all sizes across various industries. Our customers range from individuals and small businesses just getting started to some of the world’s most iconic brands. As of December 31, 2021, we had 4.1 million unique subscriptions on our platform.
Marketing
We employ a full life cycle marketing plan that utilizes a mix of channels to highlight the power of our all-in-one platform and increase awareness of the unique values we offer to our customers to help them manage and grow their brand. These channels include:
Brand
Our marketing efforts are thoughtfully designed to target our core customer at every potential entry point to our platform, from domains to social presence, online stores and enterprise. We showcase our brand in a creative and memorable manner through strategic partnerships that increase customer affinity. Developed and executed in-house, we believe our ads showcase the creative talents of our customers in an effective and stand out way. We track the success of our brand advertising by measuring metrics such as growth in brand awareness, organic searches and website landings.
Direct Response
We seek to optimize the efficiency of our direct response marketing spend by setting rigorous cost per acquisition targets. Our in-house programmatic buying team actively seeks out high growth channels such as Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok to garner extensive reach of potential customers who value design and aesthetics when building their online presence. We also work closely with numerous podcast hosts and YouTube creators to authentically share our product and brand story, and carefully manage the ad execution and performance at the individual host and creator level to sharpen our direct response marketing efforts.
CRM and Content
We believe that our marketing efforts do not end once we attract potential customers to our website or convert them to paid users. Our primary goal is to support our customers as they grow their businesses and we measure that through customer retention and lifetime value expansion.
We achieve this by content marketing in our own channels to inform existing customers of our latest features and platform updates to drive adoption of solutions that they may not be already subscribed to. Our content marketing also includes webinars, video tutorials and customer Q&As with tips and tricks for customers to be successful entrepreneurs and get the most of their Squarespace subscriptions through insights into our full platform capabilities.
Our targeted marketing efforts have resulted in continued unique subscription growth and increasing bookings over time.
Our marketing and sales expenses were $340.0 million and $260.0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Human Capital and Company Culture
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,600 full-time employees. Of these employees, 1,442 are located in the United States and 158 are located in the European Union.
We believe our culture serves as a strong competitive advantage, allowing us to build the kind of company that can truly lead a market and continue to innovate for our customers. The development and empowerment of our people are critical to our ability to deliver differentiated and creative solutions to our customers. We are continuously seeking to build an exceptional culture that strives to drive engagement and results in our employees exceeding expectations and directly impacting our success.
Our culture is focused on six core principles:
•Be the Customer.   Developing deep empathy for our customers’ needs, challenges and dreams is critical. We want to provide the same standard of tools and services to our customers that we want for ourselves.
Table of Contents

•Design is not a Luxury.   We believe that great design should be available to everyone and we are relentless in our pursuit of great design in everything we do.
•Build the Ideal.   We seek to shape the future of our industry by conceiving of and building game-changing products. To do this, we take bets on big ideas, while also recognizing that pursuit of perfection is a process that requires constant iteration.
•Learn Fast, Act Fast.   We believe that pursuing the fastest path to learning and having a healthy bias to action are keys to our success. We seek to do both whenever possible.
•Protect Creativity.   Ideas can come from anyone or anywhere, but they are fragile and require space to develop and grow. We believe the creative process is critical to our success and we seek to protect it as we develop new directions for our solutions and company.
•Simplify.
In September 2021, we launched our new employee development program, SQSP Learning, which allows employees to explore AI-recommended and personalized content based on their role and unique learning goals. Employees have access to voice their questions, thoughts, and opinions through company townhalls, executive team AMA’s, and employee feedback surveys. 
Starting in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic required all our employees to pivot to remote work. As offices started to re-open, in July 2020, we announced that all employees would continue to have the option to work remotely. In October 2021, we announced that the New York and Los Angeles offices were reopened on a volunteer basis. At that time, we also informed our employees that coming into the office will remain voluntary until March 1, 2022. During the pandemic the remote work policy allowed us opportunities to hire talent in more locations.
We are proud to be recognized for our focus on our people. In 2021, Comparably recognized us on numerous lists including Best Company Culture, Best Work-Life Balance, Best Perks & Benefits, Best CEOs for Diversity, Best Places to Work in New York list, and Best HR teams. We continue to be certified as a Great Place to Work and, in 2021, were on Great Place to Work Ireland’s lists for Ireland’s Best Medium Workplaces and Ireland's Best Workplaces in Tech. The Irish Times also named us to their Top 10 Best Workplaces in Ireland list in 2021. In both 2021 and 2020, Fairygodboss named us to their Best Companies for Women and Best Tech Companies for Women lists. We continue to be named one of the Built In NYC 100 Best Places to Work In NYC and, in 2021, were recognized on Built In NYC’s Best Perks & Benefits in NYC list. In 2021, Healthiest Employers named us to their lists of Healthiest Employers of NYC and Healthiest Employers of Oregon. Additionally, we were named a Top 10 New York-based Employer Brand by Hired.com every year that they issued their Brand Health Report. We have also been recognized as a General Excellence Winner within the Software category in Inc’s 2020 Best in Business list, and one of Fortune’s top 50 Best Workplaces for Parents in 2017.
Our in-house Customer Operations team (comprising over 400 employees across many locations) has won 14 Stevie Awards for outstanding customer service since 2013. We have invested heavily in developing and producing self-help educational resources for customers of various levels of technical sophistication, including guides, video tutorials and webinars, while also offering personalized and timely support through live chat and email.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Annually, we review our compensation and benefits package to ensure we can make competitive offers. Our annual compensation review coincides with our employee feedback cycle where employees and managers discuss performance over the last year to improve their learning and career development.
Competition
We believe that the market for providing SaaS-based website design and management software is evolving and highly fragmented.
We face competition from specific providers across the different facets of our business model offering services or products that overlap with parts of our solutions, including:
•Online presence solutions such as Automattic, Wix and Weebly;
•E-commerce solutions such as Shopify and BigCommerce;
•Domain registration and website hosting services such as GoDaddy;
Table of Contents

•Email marketing solutions such as MailChimp;
•Scheduling solutions such as MindBody; and
•Hospitality services such as Resy and OpenTable.
We believe that we compete favorably because of our comprehensive, all-in-one platform, multi-channel commerce capabilities, easy-to-use and design-first solutions and the overall depth and extensibility of our solutions.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on contractual arrangements, such as licenses, assignments and confidentiality agreements and technical measures.
We have been issued federal registrations for trademarks, including “Squarespace” and related stylized marks. We hold domestic and international domain names that include “Squarespace” and similar variations.
We control access to our intellectual property and confidential information through internal and external controls. We require our employees and independent contractors to enter into agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship and other technology and intellectual property created for us and protecting our confidential information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors.
Government Regulations
The legal environment of internet-based businesses, both in the United States and internationally, is evolving rapidly and is often unclear. This ambiguity includes topics such as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
We are subject to several local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personal information, payment card information or other confidential information of individuals and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. In the event of a security breach, these laws may subject us to incident response, notice and remediation costs. Failure to safeguard data adequately or to destroy data securely could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under applicable data security, unfair practices or consumer protection laws. The scope and interpretation of these laws could change and the associated burdens and our compliance costs could increase in the future.
We are also subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that govern or restrict our business and activities in certain countries and with certain persons, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by OFAC, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act.
