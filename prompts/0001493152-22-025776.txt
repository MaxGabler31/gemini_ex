Corporate History

The transaction (the “Closing”) took place on October 8, 2020 (the “Closing Date”).

Immediately following the Closing of the Merger, the Company changed its business plan to that of Unique.

UL HK was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1983. UL HK commenced its business with a focus on transpacific logistics services because of the increasing demands of trade between Hong Kong and the United States. The initial focus was on air freight services, but UL HK quickly diversified into ocean freight services. In its first fifteen years of operations, UL HK established itself as a major international logistics service provider in Hong Kong. Driven by the needs of its customer base, from 1997 through 2012, UL HK established a network of offices throughout Asia and the United States. By the end of 2012, the Unique Logistics brand was well recognized in several Asian countries including China, India, and Vietnam. In the United States, UL HK offices in Boston, Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago had a growing United States customer base in several sectors such as fashion, department stores, furniture, toys, and home goods. The vast majority of ULHK’s international business consisted of services pertaining to United States based companies.

Business Overview
 
Unique Logistics International, Inc. provides a full range of global logistics services by providing to its customers a robust international network that strategically supports the movement of its customers goods. Acting solely as a third-party logistics provider, Unique purchases available cargo space in volume from its network of carriers (such as airlines, ocean shipping, and trucking lines) and resells that space to our customers. Unique Logistics does not own any of these ships, trucks, or aircraft and does not plan on entering the ownership model.
 
Operating via its wholly owned subsidiaries, UL BOS and UL NYC, Unique provides a range of international logistics services that enable its customers to outsource to the Company sections of their supply chain process. The services provided by the Company are seamlessly managed by its network of trained employees and integrated information systems. We enable our customers to share data regarding their international vendors and purchase orders with us, execute the flow of goods and information under their operating instructions, provide visibility to the flow of goods from factory to distribution center or store and when required, update their inventory records.

● | Order Management 

Air Freight Services
 
Operating as an Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) or an airfreight consolidator, the Company provides both time savings and cost-effective air freight options to its customers. An expansive global network enables the Company to offer door to door service allowing customers to benefit from our expert staff for guidance with the physical movement of cargo and documentation compliance. Unique purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to our customers at a lower price than they would be able to negotiate themselves for their individual shipments. The Company, through its integrated management system, determines the best routing for shipments and then arrangements are made to receive the cargo into a designated warehouse. Upon receipt, cargo is inspected and weighed, documentation is collected, and export clearance is processed. Once cargo is cleared it is prepared for departure. Unique offers real-time tracking visibility for customers to view when an order is booked, departs and arrives. Unique contracts with a worldwide network of airlines and other service providers to provide the best airfreight service in assisting importers to ship using the most efficient and cost-effective method. Some of the selections we offer include:

● | Domestic, deferred, express and charter services, which permit customers to choose from a menu of different priority options that secure at different price levels, greater assurance of timely delivery 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Port to Port and Door to Door shipments, which provide customers the option of managing, independently, the post arrival services such as delivery or clearance if the Company is not providing such services 
● | Global blocked space agreements (BSA), which guarantee the availability of space on certain flights 
● | Air and ocean combination shipment which offer cost effective transportation using multimodal, combination movements, by one mode to an international hub, such as Dubai, UAE or Singapore and converting to a different mode at the hub 
● | Air and transload dedicated truck shipment, where arriving cargo is transferred from airline container or pallet into a truckload ready for delivery 
● | Dangerous goods handling requiring qualified handling 
● | Refrigerated cargo

Ocean Freight Services
 
Operating as an ocean transportation intermediary (“OTI”) to provide ocean freight service both as a non-vessel owning common carrier (“NVOCC”) and ocean freight forwarder, Unique Logistics provides to its customers ocean freight consolidation, direct ocean forwarding, and order management. We are a common carrier that holds itself out to the public to provide ocean transportation, issues its own house bills of lading or equivalent document, but does not operate the vessels by which ocean transportation is provided. The Company’s roles and responsibilities in ocean freight services include the following:

● | Selecting the most optimal ocean carriers based on both cost and service. The Company has NVOCC contracts with multiple ocean carriers and is thus able to offer its customers a choice in service; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Entering into contract/rate agreement with clients to transport their ocean shipments. Under such contracts the customer is assured of the Company’s pricing and weekly capacity to carry the customer’s cargo; 
● | Consolidating shipments at origin/deconsolidating of freight at destination. This enables the customer to receive the economics of a consolidated container rate rather than a higher rate for less than full container load (“LCL”). It also makes delivery at destination more efficient; 
● | Arranging pick-up of shipment at origin and deliver at destination, with a factory to door service; and 
● | Preparing and processing the documentation/clearance (customs/security) for shipments during ocean transit, in advance of arrival of shipment at destination.

● | Unique Logistics offers a wide array of services typically performed by multiple services providers including but not limited to, offering options to customers on ocean carrier service choices prior to final selection and securing such space based on customer requirement; this enables our customers to delegate more of its logistics management to us. A more limited range of service would require the customer to deal with multiple service providers. 
● | Communicates on any regulation/compliance issues on exporting and importing shipments 
● | Plays intermediary role at any point of ocean transportation based on customer’s routing preferences. 
● | During high demand period, space acquisition on carrier service is provided for committed delivery, and in weak demand season, lower price option is provided for utmost cost saving.

Industry Overview and Competition
 
The global logistics industry is highly competitive, and we expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future. Although there are a large number of companies that compete or provide services in one or more segments of the logistics industry, Unique Logistics is part of a much smaller group of companies that provides a full suite of services. In each area of service, we face competition from companies operating within that service segment as well as companies that provide a wider range of global services.
 
The industry includes (i) specialized Non-Vessel Owning Common Carriers (“NVOCCs”), an ocean carrier that transports goods under its own House Bill of Lading, or equivalent documentation, without operating ocean transportation vessels and (ii) Indirect Air Carriers (“IACs”) which are persons or entities within the United States, not in possession of an FAA air carrier operating certificate, which undertake to engage indirectly in air transportation of property and uses for all or any part of such transportation the services of an air carrier, freight forwarders, trucking companies, customs brokers and warehouse operators who operate within their specialized space and very often pose pricing advantages within that segment.
 
Our mission is to bring value to our customers through specific competitive advantages:
 

● | Trained, experienced staff with knowledge of those areas of the world where customers are likely to require problem solving abilities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Trained, experienced staff with knowledge of the various supply chain segments: Air, Ocean, Customs, Warehousing, and Information Technology integration. 
● | Responsive customer service and the ability to meet our customer needs with people at the front of well-established processes. 

Seasonality
 
Historically, our own operating results as well as the industry as a whole have been subject to seasonal demand. With our financial year end of May 31, typically our first and second quarters are the strongest with the fourth quarter being the weakest; however, there are no guarantees that these trends will continue or that the COVID-19 pandemic will not cause any other business disruptions. It is widely understood in the industry that these seasonal trends are influenced by a number of factors, including weather patterns, national holidays, economic conditions, consumer demand, major product launches, as well as a number of other market forces. Since many of these forces are unforeseen there is no way for us to provide assurances that these seasonal trends will continue.
Growth Strategy
 
Unique Logistics has established plans to grow its business by focusing on four key areas: (1) Organic Growth and Expansion in existing markets; (2) Strategic Acquisitions; (3) Warehousing and Distribution; and (4) Specialized services to United States companies on their overseas logistics needs in targeted Asian markets.
 
Organic Growth and Expansion in existing markets:
 
We plan to focus on developing business domestically to drive organic growth. Since the Management Buyout Transaction, we have significantly improved our operating efficiencies in the areas of procurement, customer service, finance and administration. We believe this will result in much lower overhead and the ability to build a uniform marketing strategy to build market share and further the brand recognition of Unique Logistics throughout the United States. Additionally, the Company will continuously assess its Information Technology environment based on emerging trends in logistics and customer requirements. The first step in the strategy is already in place: a single operating platform. We will continue to build add-on service tools that enhance our operating platform. One key area for technology focus will be the seamless delivery of e-Commerce services from origin to consumer with shipment visibility for both customer and the customer’s consumer.
 
We believe Unique Logistics’ business base that includes some of the largest importers in the United States can be expanded by building our sales organization and the support organization to successfully deliver our brand of service. The targeted growth areas include Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX, Houston, TX and Seattle, WA.

Strategic Acquisitions:
 
We currently maintain an option to acquire ownership of significant UL HK foreign subsidiaries that are critical to our ability to meet our customers’ international requirements. Through the Consulting Services Agreement between the Company and GEFD, we will ensure that the international brand of Unique Logistics and the seamless services provided to customers remains in place even before the options to acquire UL HK’s foreign subsidiaries is exercised. Additionally, it is our intention to increase our business by seeking additional opportunities through potential domestic acquisitions, revenue sharing arrangements, partnerships, or investments.
Warehousing and Distribution
 
Unique Logistics has successfully established a major warehousing facility in Santa Fe Springs, CA and now has in-house the management expertise (commercial as well as operational) in successfully managing such facilities. Unique Logistics has also identified a method of identifying growth opportunities by focusing on specific areas of the United States and existing well-constructed facilities where lease assumption is available with an existing customer base.
Specialized Services to US Companies in Overseas Markets
 
Unique Logistics has several decades of experience in Asian markets such as China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia. Unique Logistics is constantly dealing with a United States customer base that seeks to do business in these areas but require local expertise. We have the experience and the connections to assist United States companies with local importation, local warehousing and distribution and other local logistics and trade compliance services. We plan to build on our expertise in these four specific countries to build tailored services to US customers, including in business consulting pertaining to logistics and related trade services.
Government Regulations and Security
 
Our industry is subject to regulation and supervision by several governmental authorities.
 
Operations
 
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), have regulatory authority over our air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.
 
All United States indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by the TSA. Our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation. Our offices are licensed as an airfreight forwarder from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members.
 
The shipping of goods by sea is regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). Our Company is licensed by the FMC to operate as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) and as a NVOCC. As a licensed OTI and NVOCC, we are required to comply with several regulations, including the filing of our tariffs.
 
Under Department of Homeland Security regulations, we are a qualified participant in the Customs- Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) program requiring us to be compliant with relevant security procedures in our operations.
 

10
--


We are licensed as a customs broker by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Agency of DHS, nationally and in each U.S. customs district in which we do business. All United States customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. In other jurisdictions in which we perform customs clearance services, we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services.
 
We do not believe that current United States and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations. However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority United States-owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and, less frequently, the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and/or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities. When we encounter this sort of governmental restriction, we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations, while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license.
 
Environmental
 
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our business units. These laws and regulations cover a variety of processes, including, but not limited to: proper storage, handling and disposal of waste materials; appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks; complying with laws regarding clean air, including those governing emissions; protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders. We have established site- and activity-specific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant. In addition, we have created several programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations.
Employees and Human Capital
 
As of August 31, 2021, the Company had 108 employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is not involved in any disputes and does not have any significant litigation matters pending which the Company believes could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our Company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our Company’s or our Company’s subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.
 
However, from time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
