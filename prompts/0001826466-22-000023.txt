Item 1. Business
 Carriage House Event Center, Inc. (we, us, our, the Company or Carriage House) was incorporated in the state of Colorado on June 26, 2010. On September 11, 2018, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary company, Blue Carriage Events, Inc. As of the date of this filing, we have not conducted any business through the Company or through our subsidiary. Our principal executive offices are located at 558 Castle Pines Parkway,B-4 Suite 140 Castle Pines, Colorado, 80108 Telephone 303-730-7939.
 Operations
 The Company was formed for the purpose of researching and developing a concept of an Event Center with many additional associated businesses on the grounds of the Event Center.
 We have not generated revenue to date. Our operations since 2010 to date has consisted of extensive research of our concept and filing an S-1 registration statement and filings forms 10-K and 10-Q with the SEC.
 Our independent accountants have expressed a going concern opinion.
 In 2020, the Company filed an S-1 Registration Statement to register 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to be sold to the public at the price of $0.10 per share for a total of $100,000. The Registration Statement became effective on May 8, 2020.
 The Company sold 300,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 per share for gross proceeds of $30,000. The shares were sold by the officers and Directors of the Company and no broker commissions were paid. There is no guarantee that additional shares will be sold from the Registration Statement.
 After the shares offered on the S-1 Registration Statement were sold, our management continues to own over a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company. As of December 31, 2021 management and affiliates own 4,120,000 shares (92.6%) and the shareholders hold the free stock own 300,000 shares or 6.7% . As a result, they have the ability to determine the outcome on all matters requiring approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
 Covid-19 Pandemic
 In December 2019 Covid -19 emerged and spread worldwide. The World health Organization Covid-19 a pandemic resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus
 As the pandemic has progressed, new coronavirus variants have been detected around the world.
 As the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and continues to rapidly evolve, the economy of the United States, may be negatively affected for a sustained time. We cannot now reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 In 2020 and 2021, the Covid-19 Pandemic has had a dramatic effect on the progress of the Company, especially in raising the funds needed for advancing our business plan. Most cities and states have had strong restrictions on gatherings during the pandemic. Many wedding, corporate and other meetings have been cancelled or postponed for the time being, thus having a dramatic effect on the Event Center business.. If the pandemic does not subside quickly, the Company may have to move quickly in a different direction, including seeking a possible merger candidate or candidates.
 The wedding event business is the major part of our business plan for an event center.
 According to The Wedding Report, of July 29, 2020, the Covid-19 Pandemic has had an enormous effect on the wedding business in 2020.

● | 41.5% are or have moved to 2021; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 7.0% are or have cancelled altogether (some likely married but cancelled the full event); 
● | 30.5% are trying to hold their current 2020 wedding date; 
● | 46% of couples are cutting their budget by an average of 31%; 
● | 58% of couples are cutting their guest count by an average of 41%; 
● | Even more alarming, 58% of wedding vendors surveyed (6/2020) said they are expecting to lose more 2020 weddings. 

 While the report was for the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic did not diminish in 2021 and the trend continued through 2021, making the event center business extremely difficult to operate profitably.
 Many of those that have had their reservations at an event center, sometimes a year in advance, have had to postpone or cancel, usually because of the requirement to limited numbers of people at gatherings imposed by mayors and governors. The event center business has suffered with these cancellations. So many of the weddings that are going ahead, are doing so in a situation involving far less guests, and held in such places as a back yard. While weddings are a major part of the business of an event center, other meetings such as corporate functions have almost all been cancelled or postponed.
 In a survey done in June, 2021 Wedding report did a survey with the results as follows:
 
● | 20% of 2021 weddings rescheduled out to 2022 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Businesses are about 10% less booked than 2018/2019, it is a mixed bag 


o | 28% of businesses are more than 25% less booked
--+------------------------------------------------
o | 17% of businesses are more than 25% more booked


● | Many businesses are reporting that the second half of the year is the busiest for them 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Some are seeing surges already while others are not. I think it depends on where you are in the country and the type of business you are in. 
● | Many are reporting that this year is not profit or new events, but reschedules, so that is impacting overall profit for the year. 
● | Some are reporting that couples are still a bit nervous 
● | Good staffing is hard to find 
● | Many still reporting smaller weddings 
● | 87% of couples say they are not having any issues finding what they need or want 
● | 10% of couples reporting higher prices prior to pandemic 
● | 5% of couples reporting hard to find a venue for their date 
● | 15% of couples say they are still cutting budgets by as much as 28% 
● | 15% of couples say they are still cutting guest counts by as much as 27% 
● | Both budget cuts and guest count reduction is consistent with what businesses are reporting. 

 There is no way of knowing when the Covid-19 pandemic will subside and allow for more public meetings.
 Since our Company is based heavily on an event center, and thus on meetings of 50 to 1,000 people, the progress of the Company has been dramatically curtailed in a number of ways. First, in the raising of capital through investors in our public offering and in additional private capital. Second in advancing our business plan in a number of areas, including getting the interest of companies that might be interested in participating in our overall concept.
 These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 General Information
 We are a startup company and have not generated revenues and have a short operating history. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Our plan is to attempt to continue with our business plan of developing a unique Event Center, however, in a limited way until the Covid-19 Pandemic subsides. If the Covid-19 and other variances does not end immediately, the company may have to move in a different direction, including seeking a possible merger candidate for the Company.
 Our focus for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 will be on continuing to attempt to raise additional capital, more research as to the overall concept and contacting companies that would desire to be a part of the event center concept.

● | Provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the IPO Registration Statement in all SEC filings, rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required; 
● | Delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies; and 
● | Be exempted from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to receive an outside auditors attestation regarding the issuers internal controls.

● | Restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the IPO, even from an investment bank that is underwriting the IPO; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The requirement initially to publicly file IPO Registration Statements. Emerging growth companies can confidentially file draft Registration Statements and any amendments with the SEC. Public filings of the draft documents must be made at least 21 days prior to commencement of the IPO road show. 

Other Public Company Requirements
 Emerging growth companies are also exempt from other ongoing obligations of most public companies, such as:
 
● | The requirements under Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act and Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act to disclose executive compensation information on pay-for-performance and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements, such as the compensation discussion and analysis, under Item 402 of Regulation S-K; and

 Competition
 There are over 40 facilities acting as event centers of various types in the Denver metropolitan area. These facilities include those that were constructed to be an event center, older buildings such as homes, restaurants and churches converted into an event center. In addition, hotels with event facilities, restaurants with rooms for events, golf clubs, museums, community centers special facilities open to the public.
 There is no assurance that we will be able to compete with the existing event centers and those that hold events of all kinds, and new event centers that may be built in the future.
 Many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us including:
 
● | Longer operating histories and greater market presence, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Better name recognition, 
● | Access to larger customer bases, 
● | Economies of scale and cost structure advantages, and 
● | Greater sales and marketing, programming, distribution, technical, financial and other resources. 

 These competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or third parties. In addition, some of our competitors have used or may use aggressive pricing or promotional strategies, have stronger relationships on more favorable terms with retail outlets. These relationships may affect the ability of potential customers to purchase our products.
 We operate in a highly competitive environment for event centers. The majority of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we plan to operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for facilities and personnel than our financial resources permit.

 Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets
