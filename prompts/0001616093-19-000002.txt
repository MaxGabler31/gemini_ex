Item 1. Business.
General
We are a Delaware corporation incorporated on August 29, 1996, and have been operating as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our formation. We are an indirect subsidiary of Wells Fargo and the Bank.



Our organizational structure as of December 31, 2018 was:

 | | Wells Fargo & Company(100% of the common stock of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,directly and indirectly) | 
 | | Wells Fargo Bank,National Association(100% of the common stock of Omniplus Capital Corporation and Wells Fargo Insurance Re., Inc., indirectly) | 
$275,000,000Aggregate LiquidationPreference Series A Preferred Stock (100% Public Investors) | Common Stock(64.3% Omniplus Capital Corporation35.7% Wells Fargo Insurance Re., Inc.) | | $667,000 Aggregate Liquidation Preference Series B Preferred Stock(82.2% Omniplus Capital Corporation17.8% Current or Former Wells Fargo Employees and Other Third-Party Investors)
 | | Wells FargoReal Estate Investment Corporation | 

Our principal business is to acquire, hold and manage domestic mortgage assets and other authorized investments. Although we have the authority to acquire interests in real estate loans and other authorized investments from unaffiliated third parties, as of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our interests in mortgages and other assets have been acquired from the Bank pursuant to a loan participation agreement or loan participation and servicing 


and assignment agreements. The Bank originated the loans, purchased them from other financial institutions or acquired them as part of the acquisition of other financial institutions. We may also acquire from time to time real estate loans or other assets from unaffiliated third parties. In addition, we may acquire from time to time mortgage-backed securities and a limited amount of additional non-mortgage related securities from the Bank. 


2

On August 26, 2016, the Company issued and sold 21.2 million shares of common stock to affiliates of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 billion. Subsequent to the issuance, the Company used the proceeds, as well as proceeds from loan paydowns and payoffs, to acquire $19.1 billion of real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and $1.9 billion of commercial secured by real estate loans (Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions).
Substantially all of the loans in our portfolio are serviced by the Bank pursuant to the terms of a servicing agreement or loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. The Bank has delegated servicing responsibility for certain loans to third parties, which are not affiliated with us or the Bank. 
General Description of Mortgage Assets and Other Authorized Investments; Investment Policy
General
We do not have lending operations. Instead, we expect to acquire our loans principally from the Bank. See “Assets in General; Participation Interests and Transfers” in this Report.
Authorized Investments
As a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), requires us to invest at least 75% of the total value of our assets in real estate assets, which includes residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, including participation interests in residential or commercial mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities eligible to be held by REITs, cash, cash equivalents, including receivables and government securities, and other real estate assets. We refer to these types of assets as “REIT Qualified Assets.” The Code also requires that not more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s assets constitute securities issued by taxable REIT subsidiaries and that the value of any one issuer’s securities, other than those securities included in the 75% test, may not exceed 5% of the value of the total assets of the REIT. In addition, under the Code, the REIT may not own more than 10% of the voting securities or more than 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, other than those securities included in the 75% test, the securities of wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiaries or taxable REIT subsidiaries. We make investments and operate our business in such a manner consistent with the requirements of the Code to qualify as a REIT. However, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our board of directors, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors, to determine that it is in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to revoke our REIT status. The Code prohibits us from electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year of such revocation. For the tax year ended December 31, 2018, we expect to be taxed as a REIT. 
REITs generally are subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on income from foreclosure property less deductible expenses directly connected with the production of that income. Income from foreclosure property includes gain from the sale of foreclosure property and income from operating foreclosure property, but income that would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test is not treated as income from foreclosure property. 


Qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test includes, generally, rental income and gain from the sale of property not held as inventory or for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business. 
Additionally, we intend to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act). Therefore, we do not intend to:

• | invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such issuers;


• | underwrite securities of other issuers;


• | actively trade in loans or other investments;


• | offer securities in exchange for property; or


• | make loans to third parties, including our officers, directors or other affiliates.

Investment Company Act of 1940
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, which for these purposes includes loans and participation interests therein of the types owned by us. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.
We believe that we qualify, and intend to conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify, for the exclusion from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) excludes from the definition of an investment company entities that are “primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” As reflected in a series of no-action letters, the SEC staff’s position on Section 3(c)(5)(C) generally requires that in order to qualify for this exclusion, an issuer must maintain 

• | at least 55% of the value of its assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate” (Qualifying Interests),


• | at least an additional 25% of its assets in other permitted real estate-type interests (reduced by any amount the issuer held in excess of the 55% minimum requirement for Qualifying Interests), and


• | no more than 20% of its assets in other than Qualifying Interests and real estate-type assets,

and also that the interests in real estate meet other criteria described in such no-action letters. Mortgage loans that were fully and exclusively secured by real property, as well as participation interests in such loans meeting certain criteria described in such no-action letters, including that the holders of the participation interests have (i) approval rights in connection with any material decisions pertaining to the administration and servicing of the loan and with respect to material modifications to the loan agreements, and (ii) in the event that the loan becomes non-performing, effective control over the remedies relating to the enforcement of the mortgage loan, including ultimate control of the foreclosure process, by having the right to (a) appoint the special 


3

servicer to manage the resolution of the loan; (b) advise, direct or approve the actions of the special servicer; (c) terminate the special servicer at any time with or without cause; (d) cure the default so that the mortgage loan is no longer non-performing and (e) purchase any senior participation interest in the underlying mortgage loan at par value plus accrued interest such that the holder would then own the entire mortgage loan, are generally qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. We believe that our participation interests in mortgage loans satisfy these criteria and that we otherwise qualify for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
The provisions of the Investment Company Act therefore may limit the assets that we may acquire. We have established a policy of limiting authorized investments that are not Qualifying Interests or other permitted real estate-type assets to no more than 20% of the value of our total assets to comply with these provisions. 
Generally, the Code designation for REIT Qualified Assets is less stringent than the Investment Company Act designation for Qualifying Interests or other permitted real estate-type assets, due to the ability under the Code to treat cash and cash equivalents as REIT Qualified Assets and a lower required ratio of REIT Qualified Assets to total assets. 
Because we are not deemed to be an investment company in accordance with the exclusion from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, Wells Fargo’s and the Bank’s ownership interests in us are therefore not prohibited by the provisions of Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the so called “Volcker Rule,” and the rules and regulations jointly promulgated thereunder.
Assets in General; Participation Interests and Transfers
We have acquired, or accepted as capital contributions, participation interests in loans both secured and not secured by real estate along with other assets. We anticipate that we will acquire, or receive as capital contributions, loans or other assets from the Bank pursuant to a loan participation agreement between the Bank and us or loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements among the Bank, certain of its subsidiaries and us. 
Substantially all of our interests in mortgages and other assets have been acquired from the Bank pursuant to a loan participation agreement or loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. The Bank originated the loans, purchased them from other financial institutions or acquired them as part of the acquisition of other financial institutions. Substantially all of our loans are serviced by the Bank. 
In general, the Bank transfers the participation interest in loans directly to us or the Bank initially transfers participation interests in loans to a subsidiary of the Bank that does not have a direct or indirect ownership interest in us, which then transfers such participation interests to the Company. We may from time to time transfer such participation interests back to such a subsidiary, which may ultimately transfer such interests back to the Bank. In 2018, we acquired $3.3 billion of participation interests in consumer loans directly from the Bank.
Pursuant to the terms of the participation and servicing and assignment agreements, we generally may not sell, transfer, encumber, assign, pledge or hypothecate our 


participation interests in loans without the prior written consent of the Bank. As such, the transfers do not qualify for sale accounting; however, the assets continue to be classified as loans in our financial statements because the returns and recoverability of these non-recourse receivables are entirely dependent on the performance of the underlying loans. The Company initially measures the non-recourse receivables at the cash proceeds exchanged which represents the fair value of the transferred loans. During 2018, we modified our consumer loan participation and servicing agreements, which has removed the restrictions that prevented sale accounting. In 2018, we acquired $3.3 billion of consumer loans under these modified loan participation and servicing agreements. The assets are classified as loans in our financial statements and initially recorded at fair value. 
We also have the authority to acquire interests in loans and other assets directly from unaffiliated third parties. In addition, we may acquire from time to time mortgage-backed securities and a limited amount of additional non-mortgage related securities from the Bank. 
Consumer Loans
Our consumer loan portfolio consists of real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans. We refer to residential mortgage loans typically made for personal, family or household use and evidenced by a promissory note secured by a mortgage or deed of trust or other similar security instrument creating a first lien on 1-4 family real estate property as “real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans” and those creating a lien junior to a first lien on 1-4 family real estate property as “real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans” and collectively as “real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans” or “consumer loans.” Our portfolio of real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans consists of both adjustable and fixed rate mortgages.
Our portfolio of real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans includes loans each secured by a first lien mortgage on the real estate. The properties underlying real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans consist of single-family detached units, individual condominium units, 2-4 family dwelling units and townhouses. Our portfolio of real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage loans consists predominantly of loans that bear interest at fixed rates.
Our portfolio of real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans includes loans each secured by a junior lien mortgage that typically is on the borrower’s residence and typically are made for reasons such as home improvements, acquisition of furniture and fixtures, purchases of automobiles and debt consolidation. Generally, junior liens are repaid on an amortization basis. Substantially all of our portfolio of real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans consists of loans that bear interest at fixed rates.
Commercial Loans
Our commercial loan portfolio consists of commercial properties secured by real estate (CSRE) loans and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. CSRE loans are loans secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on a multi-family residential or commercial real estate property or real estate construction loans secured by real property. C&I loans are loans for commercial, financial or industrial purposes, whether secured or unsecured, single-payment or installment. 


4

Our CSRE portfolio consists of both mortgage loans and construction loans, where loans are secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2018, C&I loans were less than 1 percent of total loans. Substantially all of the loans in our C&I loan portfolio were unsecured. Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a secondary source of repayment. Unsecured loans are more likely than secured loans to result in a loss upon default. 
Our commercial loan portfolio consists of both adjustable and fixed rate loans.
Dividend Policy
We expect to distribute annually an aggregate amount of dividends with respect to our outstanding capital stock equal to approximately 100% of our REIT taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. REIT taxable income means the taxable income of a REIT, which generally is computed in the same fashion as the taxable income of any corporation, except that (a) certain deductions are not available, such as the deduction for dividends received, (b) it may deduct dividends paid (or deemed paid) during the taxable year, (c) net capital gains and losses are excluded, and (d) certain other adjustments are made. Such dividend distributions may in some periods exceed net income determined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) due to differences in income and expense recognition for REIT taxable income determination purposes. In order to remain qualified as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. 
Dividends will be authorized and declared at the discretion of our board of directors. Factors that would generally be considered by our board of directors in making this determination are our distributable funds, financial condition and capital needs, the impact of current and pending legislation and regulations, Delaware corporation law, economic conditions, tax considerations and our continued qualification as a REIT. Although there can be no assurance, we currently expect that both our cash available for distribution and our REIT taxable income will be in excess of the amounts needed to pay dividends on all of our outstanding series of preferred stock, even in the event of a significant drop in interest rate levels or increase in allowance for loan losses because: 

• | substantially all of our assets are interest-bearing;


• | while from time to time we may incur indebtedness, we will not incur an aggregate amount that exceeds 20% of our stockholders’ equity;


• | we expect that our interest-earning assets will continue to exceed the liquidation preference of our preferred stock; and


• | we anticipate that, in addition to cash flows from operations, additional cash will be available from principal payments on the loans we hold.

Accordingly, we expect that we will, after paying the dividends on all of our preferred stock, pay dividends to holders of shares of our common stock in an amount sufficient to comply with applicable requirements regarding qualification as a REIT. 
Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the Bank’s relationship to us results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) will have the authority to issue an order that restricts our ability to make 


dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders. National banking laws and other banking regulations limit the total dividend payments made by a consolidated banking entity to be the sum of earnings for the current year and prior two years less dividends paid during the same periods. Any dividends paid in excess of this amount can only be made with the approval of the Bank’s regulator. In addition, the payment of dividends would be prohibited under the OCC’s prompt corrective action regulations if the Bank becomes or would become “undercapitalized” for purposes of such regulations. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Finally, Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries, including WFREIC, are subject to broad prudential supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve), which may result in a limitation on or the elimination of our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, including, for example, in the event that the OCC had not otherwise restricted the payment of such dividends as described above and the Federal Reserve determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.
Conflicts of Interest and Related Management Policies and Programs
General 
In administering our loan portfolio and other authorized investments pursuant to the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements, the Bank has a high degree of autonomy. We have, however, adopted certain practices to guide our administration with respect to the acquisition and disposition of assets, use of leverage, credit risk management, and certain other activities. The loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements may be amended, at the discretion of our board of directors and, in certain circumstances subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, from time to time without a vote of our stockholders. A majority of the members of our board of directors are considered independent from us and the Bank.
Asset Acquisition and Disposition Policies
Management determines the timing of loan acquisitions by considering available cash and borrowing capacity on our Bank line of credit in conjunction with requirements to maintain our REIT status. Once the decision is made to acquire loans, management works with the respective business lines within the Bank to identify loans to be acquired. These loans are evaluated against credit criteria approved by our board of directors that consumer and commercial loans must meet to be eligible for us to acquire. 
The criteria approved for participation interests in consumer loans include: 

• | loans must be performing, meaning they are current;


• | the borrower has made at least 3 payments;


• | the borrower’s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score is above established thresholds;


• | the loans must have loan to value (LTV)/combined loan to value (CLTV) below established thresholds;


• | loans must be unencumbered; and

5


• | loans must be secured by real property such that they are REIT Qualified Assets.

The criteria approved for participation interests in commercial loans include: 

• | loans must be performing, meaning they are current;


• | loans must be designated as Pass under the Bank’s borrower and collateral quality ratings; and


• | loans must be secured by real property such that they are REIT Qualified Assets.

The above criteria may be amended from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors. 
In addition, the board of directors has limited our acquisitions so that non-Qualifying Interests and other permitted real estate-type assets for purposes of the exclusion from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act will be no greater than 20% of the total value of our total assets. We do not have specific policies with respect to the percentage of consumer and commercial loans we hold.
We monitor and administer our asset portfolio by investing the proceeds of our assets in other interest earning assets such that our aggregate pro forma funds from operations (FFO) over any period of four fiscal quarters will equal or exceed 150% of the amount that would be required to pay full annual dividends on our Series A and Series B preferred stock, as well as any parity stock, except as may be necessary to maintain our status as a REIT. 
We may from time to time acquire whole loans or participation interests in loans directly from unaffiliated third parties. It is our intention that any whole loans or participation interests acquired directly from unaffiliated third parties will meet the same general criteria as the loans or participation interests we acquire from the Bank. 
In the past, we have acquired or accepted as capital contributions whole loans and participation interests in loans both secured and not secured by real property along with other assets. We anticipate that we will acquire, or receive as capital contributions, interests in additional real estate secured loans from the Bank. We may use any proceeds received in connection with the repayment or disposition of loans in our portfolio to acquire additional loans. Although we are not precluded from acquiring additional types of whole loans, loan participation interests or other assets, we anticipate that additional loans acquired by us will be of the types described above under the heading “General Description of Mortgage Assets and Other Authorized Investments; Investment Policy.” 
We may from time to time acquire a limited amount of other authorized investments, including mortgage-backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans that are secured by real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans or commercial real estate properties located throughout the U.S. We do not intend to acquire any interest-only or principal-only mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2018, we did not hold any mortgage-backed securities. 
We do not have a direct contractual relationship with borrowers under the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. As the holder of participation interests in loans, substantially all of which currently are serviced by the Bank, the Company is dependent on the servicing and efforts of the Bank. See “Servicing” in this Report. 


Credit Risk Management Policies
For a description of our credit risk management policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Risk Management” in this Report.
Conflict of Interest Policies
Because of the nature of our relationship with the Bank and its affiliates, it is likely that conflicts of interest will arise with respect to certain transactions, including, without limitation, our acquisition of loans from, or disposition of loans to, the Bank, foreclosure on defaulted loans and the modification of loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. It is our policy that the terms of any financial transactions with the Bank will be consistent with those available from third parties in the lending industry. 
Conflicts of interest among us and the Bank or its affiliates may also arise in connection with making decisions that bear upon the credit arrangements that the Bank or its affiliates may have with a borrower under a loan. Conflicts also could arise in connection with actions taken by us or the Bank or its affiliates. In addition, conflicts could arise between the Bank or its affiliates and us in connection with modifications to consumer loans, including under modifications made pursuant to the Bank’s proprietary programs. 
It is our intention that any agreements and transactions between us and the Bank or its affiliates, including, without limitation, any loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements, be fair to all parties and consistent with market terms for such types of transactions. Our board of directors consists of mostly independent directors, and the requirement in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that certain of our actions be approved by a majority of our independent directors is intended to ensure fair dealings among us and the Bank or its affiliates. There can be no assurance, however, that any such agreement or transaction will not differ from terms that could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
There are no provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limiting any of our officers, directors, stockholders, or affiliates from having any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any asset to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction in which we have an interest or from engaging in acquiring, holding, and managing our assets or from engaging for their own account in business activities of the type conducted by us. It is expected that the Bank will have direct interests in transactions with us, including, without limitation, the sale of assets to us; however, except as borrowers under consumer loans, none of our officers or directors will have any interests in such mortgage assets. 
Other Policies
We may, under certain circumstances, purchase shares of our capital stock in the open market or otherwise. We have no present intention of repurchasing any of our shares of capital stock, and any such action would be taken only in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and regulations and the requirements for qualifying as a REIT.

Servicing
Substantially all the loans in our portfolio currently are serviced by the Bank pursuant to the terms of a servicing agreement or loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. The Bank has delegated servicing responsibility for certain consumer loans to third parties that are not affiliated with us or the Bank or its affiliates. 
We pay the Bank monthly loan servicing fees for its services under the terms of the servicing agreement and the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. The amount and terms of the fee are determined by mutual agreement of the Bank and us from time to time during the terms of the servicing agreement and the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements. 
Depending on the loan type, the monthly servicing fee charges are based in part on (a) outstanding principal balances or (b) a total loan commitment amount. See Note 6 (Transactions with Related Parties) to Financial Statements in this Report for more details.
The servicing agreement and the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements require the Bank to service the loans in our portfolio in a manner substantially the same as for similar work performed by the Bank for transactions on its own behalf. The Bank collects and remits principal and interest payments, maintains perfected collateral positions, and submits and pursues insurance claims. The Bank also provides accounting and reporting services required by us for our participation interests and loans. We also may direct the Bank to dispose of any loans that are classified as nonperforming, placed in a nonperforming status or renegotiated due to the financial deterioration of the borrower. The Bank is required to pay all expenses related to the performance of its duties under the servicing agreement and the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements, including any payment to its affiliates or third parties for servicing the loans. 
In accordance with the terms of the servicing agreement and the loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements in place, we have the authority to decide whether to foreclose on collateral that secures a loan in the event of a default as well as certain other rights. Upon sale or other disposition of foreclosure property, the Bank will remit to us the proceeds less the cost of holding and selling the foreclosure property. In the event it is determined that it would be uneconomical to foreclose on the related property, the entire outstanding principal balance of the real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan may be charged off. In addition, we may separately agree with the Bank to sell a defaulted loan back to the Bank at its estimated fair value. 
We anticipate that the Bank will continue to act as servicer of any additional loans that we acquire from the Bank. We anticipate that any such servicing arrangement that we enter into in the future with the Bank will contain fees and other terms that most likely will differ from, but be substantially equivalent to, those that would be contained in servicing arrangements entered into with unaffiliated third parties. To the extent we acquire loans or participation interests from unaffiliated third parties, we anticipate that such loans or participation interests may be serviced by entities other than the Bank.
It is our policy that any servicing arrangements with unaffiliated third parties will be consistent with standard industry practices.


Pledge of Loans on Behalf of the Bank
The Bank accesses secured borrowing facilities through the Federal Home Loan Banks and through the discount window of the Federal Reserve Banks. The Bank is currently a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Federal Home Loan Banks are cooperatives that lending institutions use to finance housing and economic development in local communities. Federal Home Loan Banks make loans, or advances, to their members on the security of mortgages and other eligible collateral pledged by the borrowing member. The discount window of the Federal Reserve Banks generally provides access to short-term, usually overnight, borrowing. 
The certificate of designation for the Series A preferred stock limits our ability to pledge loans to an aggregate amount not exceeding 80% of our total assets at any time as collateral on behalf of the Bank for the Bank’s access to secured borrowing facilities through the Federal Home Loan Banks or the discount window of Federal Reserve Banks; provided that, after giving effect to any and all such pledges of assets, the unpaid principal balance of our total unpledged, performing assets (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be pledged in respect of any other indebtedness we incur or otherwise) will equal or exceed three times the sum of the aggregate liquidation preference of our Series A and Series B preferred stock then outstanding plus any other parity stock then outstanding. Performing assets are assets other than nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets. 
A Federal Home Loan Bank has priority over other creditors with respect to assets pledged to it. In the event the Bank defaults on an advance from a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank will own the pledged assets, and we will lose these assets. In the event the Bank defaults on a discount window advance, the Federal Reserve Bank may take possession of the pledged assets, and we may lose the assets. Although the Bank is obligated to reimburse us for these losses, it is likely that the Bank will be in receivership when such a default occurs. In that case, these losses would be borne by us, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
In exchange for the pledge of our loan assets, the Bank pays us a fee that is consistent with market terms. Such fee may be renegotiated by us and the Bank from time to time. Any material amendment to the terms of agreements related to the pledge of our loan assets on behalf of the Bank, including with respect to fees, will require the approval of a majority of our independent directors.

Competition
In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we can only be a passive investor in real estate loans and certain other assets. Thus, we do not originate loans. We anticipate that we will continue to hold interests in mortgage and other loans in addition to those in the current portfolio and that substantially all of these loans will be obtained from the Bank. The Bank competes with mortgage conduit programs, investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, banks, savings banks, finance companies, mortgage bankers or insurance companies in acquiring and originating loans. To the extent we acquire additional loans or participation interests directly from unaffiliated third parties in the future, we will face competition similar to that which the Bank faces in acquiring such loans or participation interests.
Regulatory Considerations
Economic, market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that they, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any such new legislation or regulation could be the basis of a regulatory event that would permit us to redeem our Series A preferred stock.
As a REIT, we are subject to regulation under the Code. The Code requires us to invest at least 75% of the total value of our assets in REIT Qualified Assets. In addition, we intend to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act. See “– General Description of Mortgage Assets and Other Authorized Investments; Investment Policy” in this Report for more detailed descriptions of the requirements of the Code applicable to us and the requirements we have to follow in order not to be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was enacted resulting in significant changes to the Code, however WFREIC will not be materially impacted as the REIT provisions of the Code were not changed. Any new legislation or new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions related to the Code or the Investment Company Act could be the basis of a tax event or an investment company event that would permit us to redeem our Series A preferred stock.
Under certain circumstances, the OCC and the Federal Reserve have the authority to restrict our ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders. See “– Dividend Policy” in this Report for a more detailed description of such restrictions.

Employees
We have two current executive officers who are also officers of Wells Fargo. Our non-executive officers are also officers or employees of Wells Fargo and/or certain of its affiliates, including the Bank. We do not anticipate that we will require any additional employees because employees of the Bank are servicing the loans under the participation and servicing and assignment agreements. We maintain corporate records and audited financial statements that are separate from those of the Bank. Except as borrowers under real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans, none of our officers, employees or directors will have any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any mortgage asset to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction in which we have an interest or will engage in acquiring, holding and managing mortgage assets.
Executive Offices
Our principal executive offices are located at 90 South 7th Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402 (telephone number (855) 825-1437).
Available Information
The Company does not maintain its own website. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are accessible without charge on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov and on Wells Fargo’s website, www.wellsfargo.com/invest_relations/filings.
