Item 1. | Business

At present rates of global industrialization and population growth, food and energy supplies and environmental and healthcare resources are becoming more scarce and/or costly. We believe it is not a viable option for mankind to continue on this path â€” new solutions will be necessary to preserve and globally expand a high quality of life. We believe that synthetic biology is a solution.
We believe we are a leader in the field of synthetic biology, focusing on programming biological systems to alleviate disease, remediate environmental challenges, and provide sustainable food and industrial chemicals. Synthetic biology involves the tightly controlled expression of natural and engineered genes (DNA segments) in a variety of animal, plant and microorganismal hosts. Our historical approach primarily involved an ECC model in which we served principally as the technology engine for a partner experienced in a given commercial arena. As our experience has deepened, we have moved toward more JVs and the self-development of projects we view as particularly compelling and within our increasing areas of expertise.
Synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems to enable rational, design-based control of cellular function for a specific purpose. Using our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, we design, build and regulate gene programs, which are DNA sequences that consist of key genetic components. A single gene program or a complex, multi-genic program is fabricated and stored within a DNA vector. Vectors are segments of DNA used as a vehicle to transmit genetic information. DNA vectors can, in turn, be introduced into cells in order to generate a simple or complex cellular system, which are the basic and complex cellular activities that take place within a cell and the interaction of those systems in the greater cellular environment. It is these genetically modified cell systems that can be used to produce biological effector molecules, or be employed directly to enable the development of new and improved products and manufacturing processes across a variety of end markets, including health, food, energy, environment, and consumer. Our synthetic biology capabilities include the ability to precisely control the amount, location and modification of biological molecules to control the function and output of living cells and optimize for desired results at an industrial scale.
Working with our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborators, we seek to create more effective, less costly and more sustainable solutions than can be provided through current industry practices. Our technologies combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. We efficiently engineer precise and complex gene programs across many cell types. We apply the engineering principle of a design-build-test-learn continuum, through which we accumulate knowledge about the characteristics and performance of gene programs and cell lines. This process of continuous learning allows us to enhance our ability to design and build improved and more complex gene programs and cellular systems.
While the field of synthetic biology is still emerging, the addressable markets that may benefit from this approach are large and well-established. In health, synthetic biology may provide new approaches to treating diseases, as well as improvements to the manufacture of existing products. It is estimated that the global biopharmaceuticals market is over $175 billion. While genetically modified salmon or tilapia may be considered new products, the global market for aquaculture was estimated at more than $170 billion in 2017. Genetically modified agricultural plants are already grown on approximately 180 million hectares around the world and are worth an estimated $15 billion. In energy, we are working to create novel, highly engineered bacteria that utilize specific energy feedstocks, typically pipeline grade natural gas, to synthesize commercial end products, such as isobutanol for gasoline blending, 2,3 Butanediol for conversion to synthetic rubber and 1,4 Butanediol for polyester. Today these target markets are estimated to represent over $100 billion in aggregate commercial opportunity.
We believe our technologies are broadly applicable across many diverse end markets, including some end markets that have failed to recognize the applicability of synthetic biology or failed to efficiently utilize biologically-based processes to produce products. To enable us to maximize the number of these markets we could address, we devised a strategy that allowed us to focus on our core expertise in synthetic biology while developing many different commercial product candidates via collaborations in a broad range of industries or end markets. Historically, we built our business primarily around the formation of ECCs. An ECC is an agreement with a collaborator to develop products based on technologies in a specifically defined field. We have sought collaborators with expertise within a specific industry sector and the commitment to provide resources for the commercialization of products within that industry sector. Through our ECCs, we provide expertise in the engineering of gene programs and cellular systems, and our collaborators are responsible for providing market and product development expertise, as well as sales and marketing capabilities. In addition, we have sometimes executed a research collaboration to develop an early-stage program pursuant to which we received reimbursement for our development costs but the exclusive commercial rights, and related access fees, were deferred until completion of an initial research program.
6

This ECC strategy has allowed us to leverage our capabilities and capital across numerous product development programs and a broader landscape of end markets than we would have been capable of addressing on our own. The strategy has also allowed us to participate in the potential upside from products that are enabled by our technologies across an extensive range of industries, without the need for us to invest considerable resources in bringing individual products to market. We presently are party to a number of these collaborations, which are in varying stages from research and development of product candidates to monitoring the progress of our collaborator in their further development and, we expect, commercialization of product candidates enabled through our collaborations.
Over time, our strategy has evolved away from ECC-type collaborations to relationships and structures that provide us with more control and ownership over the development process and commercialization path. In these new relationships and structures, we bear more of the responsibility to fund the projects and execute on product candidate development.
First, in certain strategic circumstances, we may enter into a JV with a third party collaborator whereby we may contribute access to our technology, cash or both into the JV which we will jointly control with our collaborator. Pursuant to a JV agreement, we may be required to contribute additional capital to the JV, and we may be able to receive a higher financial return than we would normally receive from an ECC to the extent that we and our collaborator are successful in developing one or more products. Second, we are increasing the resources we are expending internally on early-stage proof of concept programs where we can leverage our competitive edge in gene program creation and host cell and genome expertise. We are also seeking to partner more mature programs and capabilities or later-stage assets. In this way, we endeavor to leverage our capital resources and ultimately hope to realize significant value from our mature assets.
As we consider the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology technologies, and consistent with the evolution of our business strategy, we have acquired a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of synthetic biology. Our strategy contemplates the continued acquisition of product-focused companies that we believe may leverage our technologies and expertise in order to expand their respective product applications. We believe that the acquisition of these types of companies allows us to develop and commercialize innovative products and create significant value.
Consistent with the ongoing evolution of our strategy, from principally utilizing ECCs to seeking a more diverse approach to leverage our technology assets, we routinely consider ways to organize our business and the grouping of our assets to facilitate strategic opportunities.
What is synthetic biology?
History
Synthetic biology entails the application of engineering principles to biological systems for the purpose of designing and constructing new biological systems or redesigning/modifying existing biological systems. Biological systems are governed by DNA, the building blocks of gene programs, which control cellular processes by coding for the production of proteins and other molecules that have a functional purpose and by regulating the activities of these molecules. This regulation occurs via complex biochemical and cellular reactions working through intricate cell signaling pathways, and control over these molecules modifies the output of biological systems.
In the early 1970s, scientists utilized basic tools and procedures for transferring DNA from one organism to another. Foundational tools included: gene programs contained in vectors; enzymes that could cut DNA at specific sites; and enzymes that could "glue" two complementary segments of DNA together. Developments between 1980 and the end of the 20th century advanced the field of genetic engineering, including automated DNA sequencing, DNA amplification via polymerase chain reaction and the creation of genetically modified organisms. However, the simplistic "cut-and-paste" nature of the available tools and the absence of genomic sequence information significantly restricted the scope of early synthetic biology efforts.
More recently, synthetic biology has been enabled by the application of information technology and advanced statistical analysis, also known as bioinformatics, to genetic engineering, as well as by improvements in DNA synthesis. Synthetic biology aims to engineer gene-based programs or codes to modify cellular function to achieve a desired biological outcome. For example, applications may include the replacement of a defective protein with a functional protein to treat a broad range of human and animal disease states or the production of multiple proteins through the regulation of several genes in a cell to produce petrochemicals.

Our approach
The essence of our approach is to apply synthetic biology by using an iterative process that is rapid, automated and highly reproducible, in which we:

â€¢ | Design genes of interest and gene programs utilizing knowledge of cellular pathways and protein function;


â€¢ | Build biological molecules, gene programs and their variants to optimize performance of the biological system;


â€¢ | Test gene programs by inserting them into cellular systems and comparing the result(s) to the intended effects; and


â€¢ | Learn by utilizing information gained in our iterative processes to create better gene programs and cellular systems using a more informed and efficient process to achieve improved outcomes.

As a result of our approach, we have developed extensive knowledge about many classes of DNA components and the rules governing their expression and activity. We have also assembled an inventory of these DNA components that we can use to rationally construct unique vectors rapidly and with predictable outcomes. The knowledge embedded in our DNA database allows us to create single gene and highly complex multigenic gene programs (an individual gene program containing multiple genes).
To support our approach, we have developed, acquired, and integrated a unique suite of technologies, and we continue to expand upon their capabilities. These technologies include: our UltraVector gene design and fabrication platform and its associated library of modular DNA components; Cell Systems Informatics; RheoSwitch inducible gene switch; AttSite Recombinases; Protein Engineering; Laser-Enabled Analysis and Processing, or LEAP; ActoBiotics platform; and AdenoVerse technology platform. These technologies are complementary in nature and share the following key characteristics:

â€¢ | Platform neutral â€” outcome oriented. We can work across different cell types with the objective of achieving the intended biological outcome allowing for product development across a broad spectrum of end markets.


â€¢ | Knowledge driven. We use statistical modeling tools and computational analysis to continually acquire more knowledge about biological systems and their design to continually improve our ability to develop new and improved products and processes for our collaborators.


â€¢ | Rationally designed. Our knowledge of biological systems and components allows us to design, build and select gene programs and predict the probable outcome of these programs.


â€¢ | Capable of complexity. Our technologies enable the design and precise control of complex biological molecules and multigenic gene programs.


â€¢ | Industrial scale. We use engineering principles and automation to enable products based on synthetic biology that are commercially viable.

Our competitive strengths
We believe that our technologies, our ability to work across multiple host systems and our approach to synthetic biology â€” design-build-test-learn â€” give us a competitive advantage over traditional industrial processes as well as current approaches to synthetic biology.
We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:
We have a suite of proprietary and complementary technologies
We have built a suite of proprietary and complementary technologies that provides us with a comprehensive ability to design, create, modify and regulate gene programs and cellular systems across multiple host systems (human, animal, insect, plant, fungi, and bacteria). By virtue of the complementary nature of our technologies, we are able to provide our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborators with a diverse array of capabilities, representing a "one stop shop" to potentially develop and commercialize new and differentiated products enabled by synthetic biology.
8

Our design-build-test-learn continuum allows us to design and build improved and more complex gene programs
We have developed a core expertise and technologies to design, build and test complex gene programs, as well as technologies to isolate cells that best express the desired biological output. We have also developed an extensive bioinformatic software platform that combines information technology with advanced statistical analysis for DNA design and genetic engineering, enabling us to continually learn and create optimal conditions for our gene programs. Our approach allows us to build improved and more complex gene programs.
We believe we are a leader in synthetic biology
We believe we are the first company focused exclusively on applying synthetic biology across a broad spectrum of end markets and have been working in the field since 1998. Over the last 20 years, we have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in the design, modification and regulation of gene programs. We believe all of these factors, coupled with our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, provide us with a first-mover advantage in synthetic biology.
We serve large and diverse end markets with high built-in demand
A vast number of products consumed globally are or can be produced using biologically-based processes. Natural resources are becoming more scarce as demand exceeds supply, creating unmet needs for improvements in development and manufacturing. As a result, the need for complex biologically engineered molecules such as those enabled by our synthetic biology technologies is large and spans multiple industries, including health, food, energy, environment, and consumer. Each of these markets faces unique challenges, however all have unmet needs for improvements in product development and manufacturing that can result in savings of both cost and time as compared to traditional means of industrial design and production. Because synthetic biology has the potential to deliver against these unmet needs, we believe that significant demand already exists for improved products enabled by synthetic biology. Additionally, there are markets utilizing traditional industrial processes that have failed to recognize the significant improvement in performance that could be achieved using synthetic biology.
Our evolving business strategy allows us to leverage the broad potential of synthetic biology
We believe our ECC business model was a capital efficient and rapid way for us to initiate our participation in a diversified range of product opportunities and industrial end markets, including health, food, energy, environment, and consumer. While our ongoing ECCs continue to allow us to participate in the potential upside from products that are enabled by our technologies across an extensive range of industries, we believe that we are now capable of recognizing additional benefit from the product candidates enabled by our technologies through the formation of a variety of business structures, including operating subsidiaries and JVs. The flexibility of this approach, we believe, will enable us to maximize the value we receive for each particular opportunity within various industries in which we operate.
We have experienced management and employees
Our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Randal J. Kirk, consists of executives with a track record of success in building and managing research and development-driven companies. Our Chief Science Officer, Thomas D. Reed, was responsible for the initial conception and creation of our UltraVector technology platform. As of December 31, 2017, we had 481 research and development employees.
Our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies
We apply the potential of synthetic biology through our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies that combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. This enables us to engineer precise and complex gene programs across many cell types rapidly and inexpensively. These technologies include: our UltraVector gene design and fabrication platform and its associated library of modular DNA components; Cell Systems Informatics; RheoSwitch inducible gene switch; AttSite Recombinases; Protein Engineering; LEAP processing; ActoBiotics platform; and AdenoVerse technology platform.
In order to create a highly functional biological system, we recognize the complexity of cellular processes and the necessity to construct an optimized gene program in conditions reflective of the natural environment to allow for the creation of the optimal biological product. This requires a rigorous understanding of cell signaling pathways as well as the interactions that influence the expression of protein. This knowledge is captured in our advanced Cell Systems Informatics, which uses statistical modeling and other analytic frameworks to determine the most efficient pathways for an intended biochemical result, and also plays a critical role in our research and development as this database of information allows us to explore new targets of 
9

potential interest to our current or future subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborators. Moreover, our bioinformatics and computational modeling platform is central to our Protein Engineering, which focuses on designing enhanced and/or novel protein functionalities, including stability, localization, and catalytic activity.
In addition to creating optimized gene programs via the most efficient cell signaling pathways and in the relevant cellular environments, we have a growing library of genetic components with our UltraVector platform that enable design and assembly of gene programs which facilitate control over the quality, function, and performance of living cells. Our RheoSwitch inducible gene switch provides quantitative dose-proportionate regulation of the amount and timing of target protein expression, thereby providing another mechanism to closely control activity of a newly constructed gene program. Further, our AttSite Recombinases allow for stable, targeted gene integration and expression. Once cells have been engineered for the desired biological output, the LEAP automated platform can be used to identify and purify cells of interest, such as antibody expressing cells and stem cells. Furthermore, our ActoBiotics platform allows for targeted in situ expression of proteins and peptides from engineered microbes. Finally, our AdenoVerse technology platform is comprised of engineered adenovector serotypes which alone and in conjunction with our ability to further manipulate and improve the platform permits greater tissue specificity and target selection. We believe this platform will deliver a gene capacity exceeding 30kb which is three to six times greater than current viral delivery methods.
Our technology platform is designed to provide a "one stop shop" for start-to-finish conceptualization, engineering, regulation, optimization and production of biologically-based solutions that we believe possess many advantages over traditional processes. Our leading-edge toolkit can empower many different cell platforms allowing for selection of the most effective host to create a desired product or solution for our partners.
Our markets
Synthetic biology has applicability across many diverse end markets. Our goal is to be a leader in the application of synthetic biology for products currently utilizing biologically-based processes, and a leader in the replacement of conventional processes and products with biologically-based substitutes. Through the application of our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, we believe we can create optimized biological processes and create substitutes for traditional industrial techniques, leading to improved products that are developed and manufactured faster and more cost-effectively.
Human and Animal Health
It is estimated that the global biopharmaceuticals market is over $175 billion and is projected to reach greater than $290 billion by 2021. Additionally, the global animal health market was valued at more than $30 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow to over $50 billion by 2025. We believe that the unreliable, costly discovery and development process for new medicines is being replaced by the engineering of biology at the genetic, molecular, and cellular level. Our ability to regulate complex gene programs and cellular systems by applying the principles of science, engineering, and computational bioinformatics with proprietary technologies is being utilized to design new therapies for humans and animals. We are applying our approach to develop targeted gene therapy applications and novel solutions within oncology, rare diseases, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ocular diseases, human infertility, infectious diseases, and animal health, as well as autoimmune, metabolic, and gastrointestinal disorders. All of our human therapeutic product candidates are in the drug discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of development.
Food and Agriculture
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations predicts that by 2050 the world's population will grow to almost 10 billion, global demand for food and other agricultural products is expected to increase 50 percent, and global demand for livestock products will increase by 70 percent. We are focused on enabling efficient, high-quality food production that sustainably supports the necessities of our growing population. By applying our suite of technologies, we aim to facilitate development of agricultural, livestock and aquaculture resources that deliver innovative approaches and superior production yields in an environmentally responsible manner.
Energy and Chemicals
Biological production via precise enzymatic conversion represents a promising approach for the efficient production of important energy products. Despite this promise, current attempts to produce "clean" energy are expensive to implement and operate at near break-even yields despite government assistance. Additionally, many alternative energy initiatives start from food sources such as corn and sugarcane. As a result, these low efficiency processes also compete for arable land and water with the agriculture industry. Using our cellular engineering experience and suite of technologies, we have developed microbial 
10

cell lines for bioconversion of methane to higher carbon content compounds. We believe this proprietary platform holds the potential to modernize the existing gas-to-liquids industry by generating important fuels and chemicals at a fraction of the cost of traditional conversion methods. Our bioconversion approach also is being designed to reach an overall balance between sustainable productive yields and attractive economic returns.
To date we have proven biological production of six valuable and large market fuel and chemical products. These products are isobutanol for gasoline blending, 2,3 Butanediol and isoprene for conversion to synthetic rubber, 1,4 Butanediol for polyester, farnesene for diesel fuel and lubricants and isobutyraldehyde for acrylics. In aggregate, we estimate that these products represent greater than a $100 billion market opportunity.
Environment
As a result of industrialization and rapidly growing global populations, chemicals, heavy metals, and various other contaminants of concern are pervasive in the environment. These pollutants result in poor quality of drinking water, loss of water supply, contaminated ground water and soil, high clean-up costs, and potential health problems. In addition, increased globalization has facilitated the spread of pests that affect human and environmental health by carrying disease and damaging crops. We seek to engineer biological solutions that are designed to protect, preserve or restore the environment and promote sustainability of natural resources. These biological approaches may replace products that present an environmental hazard. Examples include toxin-free, species-specific insect control methods that do not persist in the environment and microbial-based strategies for bioremediation of soil and water contamination.
Consumer Products
Despite its size and the number of products that can be achieved through biological means, the consumer market has experienced limited impact from synthetic biology. We are committed to developing biologically-based processes that displace petroleum-derived ingredients and polymers. Additionally, we are focused on reducing the wasteful practices associated with extracting compounds that occur in limiting amounts in plants and animals. Through our synthetic biology capabilities, we plan to utilize innovative biologically-based applications for the development of products, such as personal care items and decorative arts, to improve the lives of consumers every day.
Our business strategy
We believe our technologies are broadly applicable across many diverse end markets, including some end markets that have failed to recognize the applicability of synthetic biology or failed to efficiently utilize biologically-based processes to produce products. To enable us to maximize the number of these markets we could address, we devised a strategy that allowed us to focus on our core expertise in synthetic biology while developing many different commercial product candidates via collaborations in a broad range of industries or end markets. We built our business primarily around the formation of ECCs, as well as certain research collaborations.
This ECC strategy allowed us to leverage our capabilities and capital across numerous product development programs and a broader landscape of end markets than we would have been capable of addressing on our own. The strategy also allowed us to participate in the potential upside from products that are enabled by our technologies across an extensive range of industries, without the need for us to invest considerable resources in bringing individual products to market. We presently are party to a number of these collaborations, which are in varying stages from research and development of product candidates to monitoring the progress of our collaborator in their further development and, we expect, commercialization of product candidates enabled through our collaboration.
Over time, our strategy has evolved away from ECC-type collaborations to relationships and structures that provide us with more control and ownership over the development process and commercialization path. In these new relationships and structures, we bear more of the responsibility to fund the projects and execute on product candidate development.
First, in certain strategic circumstances, we may enter into a JV with a third party collaborator whereby we may contribute access to our technology, cash or both into the JV which we will jointly control with our collaborator. Pursuant to a JV agreement, we may be required to contribute additional capital to the JV, and we may be able to receive a higher financial return than we would normally receive from an ECC to the extent that we and our collaborator are successful in developing one or more products. Second, we are increasing the resources we are expending internally on early-stage proof of concept programs where we can leverage our competitive edge in gene program creation and host cell and genome expertise and are seeking to partner with more mature programs and capabilities, some of which may be through ECCs. In this way, we endeavor to leverage of our capital resources and ultimately hope to realize significant value from our mature assets. Our gas-to-liquid 
11

platform for bioconversion of methane to higher carbon content compounds, which we refer to as our methane bioconversion platform, or MBP, is an example of our implementation of a JV approach. Based on our internally developed work on our MBP technology, we have executed two JV arrangements with related parties for specific end products.
As we consider the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology technologies, and consistent with the evolution of our business strategy, we have acquired a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of synthetic biology. Our strategy contemplates the continued acquisition of product-focused companies that we believe may leverage our technologies and expertise in order to expand their respective product applications. We believe that the acquisition of these types of companies allows us to develop and commercialize innovative products and create significant value.
Consistent with the ongoing evolution of our strategy, from principally utilizing ECCs to seeking a more diverse approach to leverage our technology assets, we routinely consider ways to organize our business and the grouping of our assets to facilitate strategic opportunities. For example, effective January 1, 2018, we transferred substantially all of our gene and cell therapy assets for human health under a newly-formed wholly owned subsidiary, Precigen, Inc., or Precigen, and we consolidated therapeutic applications of our proprietary ActoBiotics platform under ActoBio Therapeutics, Inc., or ActoBio, another wholly owned subsidiary. Additionally, we may look to partner later-stage assets in the future.
Our ECCs
Although our strategy has evolved away from a focus primarily on ECCs, we remain party to a number of such collaborations, and we may, in the future, elect to enter into additional ECCs, or expand one or more of our existing ECCs. An ECC is an agreement with a collaborator to develop products based on our technologies in one or more specifically defined fields. These fields may be narrowly defined (representing, for example, a specific therapeutic approach for a single indication) or may be broad (representing, for example, an entire class of related products). In each case, we and the collaborator precisely define the field based on factors such as the expertise of the collaborator, the relative markets for the prospective products, the collaborator's resources available to commit to the ECC and our expectations as to other prospective ECCs in related areas. Regardless of the size of the field, under each ECC we grant the collaborator exclusive rights to our services and certain of our platform technologies to commercialize products within the field.
We may realize four general categories of revenue under our ECCs: (i) technology access fees upon signing; (ii) reimbursements of costs incurred by us for our research and development and/or manufacturing efforts related to specific applications provided for in the collaboration; (iii) milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial activities; and (iv) royalties on sales of products arising from the collaboration. We may receive equity in lieu of cash for technology access fees and milestones and also may participate in capital raises to allow earlier-stage collaborators to focus their resources on product development. When such a collaborator develops greater operational or financial resources, however, its shares become a financial asset within Intrexon that is independent of our operational or collaborative purposes. 
Generally, each of our ECCs is designed to continue in perpetuity unless terminated. Each of our collaborators, however, retains the right to terminate the ECC for any reason by providing us written notice a certain period of time prior to such termination, generally ninety days. The ECC is also terminable by either party upon the other party's breach of material provisions of the ECC. The failure of our collaborator to exercise diligent efforts to develop products within the field of the ECC constitutes such a breach.
In the event one of our ECCs terminates, we are entitled to immediately pursue a collaboration with a different counterparty within the field of the terminated ECC. Moreover, technologies and product candidates in a relatively early stage of development revert to us, along with data, materials and the rights to applicable regulatory filings related to the reverted products, enabling us to develop those product candidates ourselves or incorporate them into a future collaboration. Product candidates that are at a more advanced stage of development, such as those already generating revenue or being considered for approval by an applicable regulatory body at the time of the ECC's termination are retained by the former collaborator. The collaborator has the right to commercialize such retained products although we are entitled to the royalties or other compensation to which we would be entitled as if the ECC were still in effect. Upon termination, we generally retain any technology access fees or other payments to which we are entitled through the date of termination.
In our ECCs, we retain rights to our existing intellectual property and generally any intellectual property developed using, or otherwise incorporating, our technologies. In addition, we are generally responsible for controlling the prosecution and enforcement of this intellectual property with the exception of the enforcement of patents directed solely and specifically to products developed within the field of each ECC.
12

Each of our ECCs requires the collaborator to indemnify us for all liability related to products produced pursuant to the ECC and to obtain insurance coverage related to product liability.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of the key financial terms of our significant ECCs.
Our operating subsidiaries
To derive value from the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology technologies, and consistent with the evolution of our business strategy, we routinely consider ways to organize our business to facilitate strategic opportunities. For example, effective January 1, 2018, we transferred substantially all of our gene and cell therapy assets for human health under a newly-formed wholly owned subsidiary, Precigen, and we consolidated therapeutic applications of our proprietary ActoBiotics platform under ActoBio. In addition, we have acquired a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of synthetic biology and that we now operate as subsidiaries. Our strategy contemplates the continued formation and acquisition of such operating subsidiaries. As these enterprises develop, we will determine whether to maintain full ownership, introduce investors via either private or public financing, or seek strategic options to partner or divest the businesses.

This genetically engineered, or GE, self-limiting line of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, or OX513A, has been approved by Brazil's National Biosafety Committee, or CTNBio, for unrestricted releases throughout the country. Additionally, open field trials of these mosquitoes have been conducted in Brazil, the Cayman Islands, Panama, and Malaysia under relevant permits or approvals. Further approvals will be required for commercial production and use.
Primary majority-owned operating subsidiary
AquaBounty Technologies, Inc.
AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., or AquaBounty, of which we owned approximately 58 percent as of December 31, 2017, is focusing on improving productivity in commercial aquaculture, including the development of the AquAdvantage Salmon, or AAS, an Atlantic salmon that has been genetically enhanced to reach market size in less time than conventionally farmed Atlantic salmon and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In January 2018, AquaBounty raised $12.0 million through an underwritten public offering, in which we participated by investing $5 million. As a result of this transaction, our ownership decreased to approximately 53 percent. In the future, our ownership stake in AquaBounty may drop below 50 percent, which may result in us deconsolidating AquaBounty.
Joint ventures
The following represent our significant JVs as of December 31, 2017.
Intrexon Energy Partners
In March 2014, we and certain investors, or the IEP Investors, including affiliates of Third Security, LLC, or Third Security, a related party, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement which governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon Energy Partners, LLC, or Intrexon Energy Partners, a JV formed to optimize and scale-up our MBP technology for the production of certain fuels and lubricants. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon Energy Partners providing exclusive rights to our technology for the use in bioconversion, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $25 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon Energy Partners. The IEP Investors made initial capital contributions, totaling $25 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners totaling 50 percent. We committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $25 million, and the IEP Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $25 million, at the request of the Intrexon Energy Partners' board of managers, or the Intrexon Energy Partners Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon Energy Partners is governed by the Intrexon Energy Partners Board which has five members. Two members of the Intrexon Energy Partners Board are designated by us and three members are designated by a majority of the IEP Investors. We and the IEP Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above the initial limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon Energy Partners Board.
Intrexon Energy Partners II
In December 2015, we and certain investors, or the IEPII Investors, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement which governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon Energy Partners II, LLC, or Intrexon Energy Partners II, a JV formed to utilize our MBP technology for the production of 1,4-butanediol, an industrial chemical intermediate used to manufacture spandex, polyurethane, plastics, and polyester. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon Energy Partners II providing exclusive rights to our technology for use in the field, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $18 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon Energy Partners II. The IEPII Investors made initial capital contributions, totaling $18 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners II totaling 50 percent. In December 2015, the owners of Intrexon Energy Partners II made a capital contribution of $4 million, half of which was paid by us. We committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $10 million, and the IEPII Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners II, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $10 million, at the request of the Intrexon Energy Partners II's board of managers, or the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon Energy Partners II is governed by the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board which has five members. One member of the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board is designated by us and four members are designated by a majority of the IEPII Investors. We and the IEPII Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above the initial limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board.

EnviroFlight
In February 2016, we entered into a series of transactions involving EnviroFlight, LLC, or Old EnviroFlight, Darling Ingredients Inc., or Darling, and a newly formed venture between us and Darling, or New EnviroFlight. This series of integrated transactions resulted in us acquiring substantially all of the assets of Old EnviroFlight and contemporaneously contributing all of these assets, with the exception of certain developed technology, and $3 million of cash to New EnviroFlight in exchange for a non-controlling, 50 percent membership interest in New EnviroFlight. Our contributions to New EnviroFlight included an exclusive license to the developed technology that was retained by us. Darling received the remaining 50 percent membership interest in New EnviroFlight as consideration for terminating rights previously held in the developed technology with Old EnviroFlight. New EnviroFlight was formed to generate high nutrition, low environmental impact animal and fish feed, as well as fertilizer products, from black soldier fly larvae. We and Darling, as members, have each satisfied the commitment to make additional capital contributions of up to $5 million to fund ongoing operations of New EnviroFlight.
Intrexon T1D Partners
In March 2016, we and certain investors, the T1D Investors, including affiliates of Third Security, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement which governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon T1D Partners, LLC, or the Intrexon T1D Partners, a JV formed to utilize our proprietary ActoBiotics platform to develop and commercialize products to treat type 1 diabetes. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon T1D Partners which provides the exclusive rights to our technology for use in the field, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $10 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon T1D Partners. The T1D Investors made initial capital contributions, totaling $10 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon T1D Partners totaling 50 percent. We committed to make capital contributions of up to $5 million, and the T1D Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon T1D Partners, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $5 million, at the request of Intrexon T1D Partners' board of managers, or the Intrexon T1D Partners Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon T1D Partners is governed by the Intrexon T1D Partners Board, which has five members. Two members of the Intrexon T1D Partners Board are designated by us and three members are designated by a majority of the T1D Investors. We and the T1D Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above these limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon T1D Partners Board.
S & I Ophthalmic
In September 2013, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on chronic diseases, to form S & I Ophthalmic, LLC, or S & I Ophthalmic. In December 2017, the S & I Ophthalmic board of managers agreed to dissolve the JV and terminate the ECC with us. Upon the dissolution, we received $2.6 million, which represents our portion of S & I Ophthalmic's remaining cash after all liabilities were settled.
OvaXon
In December 2013, we entered into an ECC with OvaScience, Inc., or OvaScience, a life sciences company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of new treatments for infertility. Additionally, we and OvaScience formed OvaXon, LLC, or OvaXon, a JV to create new applications for improving human and animal health. Both we and OvaScience made an initial capital contribution of $1.5 million in January 2014 for a 50 percent membership interest in OvaXon. OvaXon is governed by the OvaXon board of managers, or the OvaXon Board, which has four members, two each from us and OvaScience. In cases in which the OvaXon Board determines that additional capital contributions are necessary in order for OvaXon to conduct business and comply with its obligations, each of us and OvaScience have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions to OvaXon subject to the terms of the agreement. OvaScience also licensed certain technology relating to egg precursor cells to OvaXon pursuant to a separate license agreement. In February 2018, OvaScience provided their notice of termination of the ECC between them and us, to be effective in May 2018 in accordance with the ECC agreement. We and OvaScience are in discussions regarding dissolving the OvaXon JV and terminating the related ECC agreement.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of significant collaborations between us and our JVs.

Mergers, acquisitions, and technology in-licensing
We may augment our suite of proprietary technologies through mergers or acquisitions of technologies which then become available to new or existing ventures, including operating subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborations. Among other things, we may pursue technologies that we believe will be generally complementary to our existing technologies and also meet our desired return on investment and other economic criteria. In certain cases, such technologies may already be applied in the production of products or services and in these cases we may seek to expand the breadth or efficacy of such products or services through the use of our technologies. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of mergers, acquisitions or significant technology in-licensing activities in 2017.
Competition
We believe that we are a leader in synthetic biology. We do not believe that we have any direct competitors who provide similar technologies which fully enable the commercialization of products developed using synthetic biology across a broad spectrum of biologically based industries. As a result, we believe our competition is more indirect and general in nature, and falls into three broad categories:

â€¢ | Synthetic biology service providers. There are companies that have competing technologies for individual pieces of our suite of complementary technologies. For example, there are companies that can synthesize DNA, and there are companies that can develop monoclonal antibodies. One portion of our proprietary technology related to DNA synthesis and assembly includes the ability to de novo synthesize DNA. We believe the following companies engage in the manufacture of DNA componentry: ATUM, Inc., Blue Heron Biotech, LLC (a subsidiary of OriGene), Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), GenScript USA, Inc., and Life Technologies Corporation, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.


â€¢ | Industrial companies who may develop their own approach to synthetic biology. Rather than becoming a collaborator with us, potential collaborators may decide to invest time and capital to internally develop their own synthetic biology capabilities. For example, large biopharmaceutical companies, energy companies, and ag-bio companies may pursue a proprietary synthetic biology strategy.


â€¢ | Industrial companies who may develop competing products using other technologies. Products enabled by our synthetic biology will face competition in the market, including from products which have been developed using other industrial technologies. For example, large biopharmaceutical companies pursue other technologies for drug development, and large ag-bio companies pursue other technologies for the development of genetically modified crops. The rapidly evolving market for developing GE T-cells in particular, a primary focus of our collaboration with ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc., or ZIOPHARM, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Genetically engineering T-cells faces significant competition in the chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, technology space from multiple companies and their collaborators, such as Novartis/University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird Bio/Celgene/Baylor College of Medicine/Five Prime/Gilead Sciences/ViroMed Laboratories, Kite Pharma/National Cancer Institute, Juno Therapeutics/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center/Seattle Children's Research Institute, Cellectis/Pfizer/Servier, Adaptimmune/GSK and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals. We face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by other companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

Intellectual property
As we advance technologies across multiple platforms and synthetic biology areas, correspondingly, we apply a multilayered approach for protecting intellectual property relating to the inventions we have developed internally as well as those we have acquired from third parties, such as by assignment or by in-license. We seek patent protection in the United States and in other countries for our inventions and discoveries, and we develop and protect our key know-how and trade secrets relating to our platform technologies as well as to the products we are developing with our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborations.
We seek patent protection for our platform technologies, including but not limited to our (i) switch technology; (ii) activator ligands for our switch technology; (iii) portfolio around various genetic componentry such as vectors, cells and organisms containing these genetic componentry; and (iv) cell identification and selection platform. In addition, we seek patents covering specific collaborator's products. With respect to a particular collaborator's product, we may seek patent protection on some or all of the following aspects of the invention such as: the compound or material composition of matter and/or the method or process of making or using the composition.
16

Through the use of our various platform technologies we seek to design and build proprietary compounds, vectors, methods and processes across a variety of end markets. In particular, we focus our intellectual property on synthetic biology technologies that provide platforms for the design and creation of cells, vectors and components for our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborations. In addition, we may pursue intermediate and product-specific patents associated with our subsidiaries', JVs', and collaborations' lead programs.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property relating to our technologies and products and potential products. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in other jurisdictions globally as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes. For instance, where we believe appropriate, we have also filed counterpart patents and patent applications in other countries, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. In the future we may file in these or additional jurisdictions as deemed appropriate for the protection of our technologies.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned at least 55 issued U.S. patents and 55 pending U.S. patent applications relating to certain aspects of our technologies, and we have pursued counterpart patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions around the world, as we have deemed appropriate. We continue to actively develop our portfolio through the filing of new patent applications, provisional and continuations or divisionals relating to our technologies, methods and products as we and our collaborators deem appropriate.
We have strategic positioning with respect to our key technologies including our owned patent portfolios directed to: our switch technology covering aspects of our switches and gene modulation systems, with a last to expire patent currently in 2032; our portfolio around various genetic componentry, such as vectors, cells and organisms containing these genetic componentry, and their use, with a last to expire patent in 2034; our activator ligand technology covering aspects of our activator ligands and their use, with a last to expire patent in 2034; and our cell identification and selection technology covering aspects of our cell identification and selection platform, including our cell purification, isolation, characterization and manipulation technologies, with a last to expire patent in 2031. Although we cannot be assured that these patents may not be subject to challenge in the future, as of this filing, there are currently no material contested proceedings and/or third party claims with respect to any of these patent portfolios.
Additionally, we complement our intellectual property portfolio with exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and options for licenses to third party technologies.
A principal component of our strategy is maximizing the value of our ECCs through our intellectual property that covers our technologies, which is accentuated by intermediate and program-specific intellectual property protections. In addition to owned and in-licensed patents, we solidify our intellectual property protection through a combination of trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information related to each platform and collaborator program. We regularly assess and review the risks and benefits of protecting our developments through each aspect of intellectual property available to us.
Because we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to protect various aspects of our core technology, we require our employees, consultants and scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with us to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our confidentiality agreements generally provide that the employee, consultant or scientific collaborator will not disclose our confidential information to third parties. These agreements also provide that inventions conceived by the employee, consultant or scientific collaborator in the course of working for us will be our exclusive property. Additionally, our employees agree to take certain steps to facilitate our assertion of ownership over such intellectual property. These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technologies, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have. In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
Regulatory environment
Regulations affecting Intrexon
Our ongoing research and development relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional regulations. As described below, our research operations are also subject to various environmental regulations. However, while 
17

most of the current laws and regulations concerning synthetic biology relate to the end products produced using synthetic biology, this may change. For example, in December 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the federal government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the federal government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms. 
As discussed below and in "Risk factors - Risks associated with our business strategy," the products produced by us and our collaborators enabled by our technology platforms are subject to extensive regulation. While we and our subsidiaries maintain regulatory compliance practices, we rely on our collaborators' compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the products they produce. We do not independently monitor whether our collaborators comply with applicable laws and regulations. Please see the risk factor entitled "Markets in which we, our JVs, and collaborators are developing products using our technologies are subject to extensive regulation, and we rely on our JVs and collaborators to comply with all applicable laws and regulations."
Environmental regulations affecting Intrexon, our JVs and our collaborators
Our JVs and collaborators and we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of employees with respect to laboratory activities required for the development of products and technologies. These laws and regulations require us and our JVs and collaborators to obtain environmental permits and comply with numerous environmental restrictions. These laws and regulations also may require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment.
Our laboratory activities and those of our JVs and collaborators inherently involve the use of potentially hazardous materials, which are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations. We design our infrastructure, procedures and equipment to meet our obligations under these regulations. We perform recurring internal and third-party audits and provide employees ongoing training and support, as required. All of our employees must comply with safety instructions and procedures, which are codified in our employment policies. Federal and state laws and regulations impose requirements on the production, importation, use and disposal of chemicals and genetically modified microorganisms, which impact us and our JVs and collaborators. Our, our JVs' and our collaborators' processes may contain GE organisms which, when used in industrial processes, are considered new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. These laws and regulations would require us, our JVs and collaborators to obtain and comply with the EPA's Microbial Commercial Activity Notice process to operate. In the European Union, we and our JVs and collaborators may be subject to a chemical regulatory program known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances). Under REACH, companies are required to register their products with the European Commission, and the registration process could result in significant costs or delay the manufacture or sale of products in the European Union.
Regulations affecting us and our collaborators
Human therapeutics regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by our collaborators. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, pharmaceuticals must receive approval from the FDA before being marketed. The FDA approves drug products other than biological products through its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The FDA licenses biological drug products, or biologics, through its authority under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The development processes for obtaining FDA approval for a non-biological drug product, or a drug, under the FDCA and for biologic licensure under the PHSA are generally similar, but have product-related differences reflected in regulations and in FDA guidance documents.
18

U.S. pharmaceutical development process
The process required by FDA before a pharmaceutical product candidate may be marketed generally involves the following:

â€¢ | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with FDA's current Good Laboratory Practice regulations and other applicable requirements;


â€¢ | submission to FDA of an application for an Investigational New Drug exemption, or IND;


â€¢ | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, of each clinical site before a clinical trial is initiated;


â€¢ | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to FDA's GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;


â€¢ | preparation and submission to FDA of an application for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency for a biologic, or of safety and efficacy for a non-biologic drug, from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


â€¢ | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;


â€¢ | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the application; and


â€¢ | FDA review and approval or licensure, of the application.

Human clinical trials under an IND
Clinical trials involve administering the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with FDA's regulations. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, an institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

â€¢ | Phase 1. The product candidate is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain early understanding of its effectiveness. For some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


â€¢ | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy evidence for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


â€¢ | Phase 3. The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the safety and efficacy of the drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the biologic. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval to gain additional experience from treatment of patients in the intended indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
19

Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials
Additional standards apply to clinical trials involving gene therapy. The FDA has issued guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which relate to, among other things: preclinical assessments; chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high.
Compliance with cGMP requirements
Drug and biologics manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved product, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market.
U.S. review and approval processes
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product for one or more uses, or indications. For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is often a necessary condition to effective treatment, and may require diagnostic devices that the FDA has cleared or approved.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials designed to further assess a drug's safety and effectiveness, or a biologic's safety, purity, and potency, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Post-approval requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of drugs and biologics continues after approval, including requirements governing cGMP and advertising and promotion. Changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may result in administrative, judicial, civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trial, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
Foreign regulation of human therapeutics
In addition to regulations in the United States, our subsidiaries, such as Precigen and ActoBio, and our collaborators that are focused on the development of human therapeutic products will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of the products enabled by our technologies. Whether or not the developer obtains FDA approval for a product, they must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before they may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Regulation of animal based technologies
The development, movement and commercialization of animal based products (animal feeds, genetically modified animals) is governed by either technology or product based laws and regulations specific to each country. In the majority of our target 
20

markets, the relevant regulatory pathway for animal based products is distinct from those governing human medicinal products although the risk assessment parameters and agencies with jurisdiction may be consistent. In the United States, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates GE animals as 'animal drugs' as well as animal feed products. The United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, regulates veterinary vaccines and biologics, and the EPA regulates pesticide products. Regulatory oversight and jurisdiction is based on either the nature of the product (i.e. meets the definition of an animal drug) or product end use. Specific statutes and regulations also define standards and data requirements that Intrexon and our collaborators must satisfy. While regulatory oversight may vary globally, animal based products must undergo regulatory review and approval prior to their movement and commercial introduction internationally. These regulations are designed to demonstrate product efficacy as well as evaluate potential risk to human/ animal health and the environment. For drugs administered to animals, mature regulatory processes are in place and often evaluated by the same authorities as human pharmaceuticals.
In the case of bioengineered animals (i.e. the AAS), the U.S. and Canada have established regulatory processes led by the FDA and Health Canada/ Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, respectively, while other countries, such as Brazil and Argentina amongst others, are in the process of developing new regulations under existing authorities for the advancement and regulation of GE animal technologies. In December 2012, the FDA published an environmental assessment, or EA, for AAS along with its Finding of No Significant Impact, or FONSI, in the Federal Register, confirming that an approval of the pending New Animal Drug Application would not have an adverse effect on the environment and opened up a 60 day period for public comment. In February 2013, the FDA extended the period for public comment by an additional 60 days, which expired in April 2013. Prior to the publication of the EA and FONSI, in September 2010, the FDA held a public meeting of its Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee to review its findings regarding AAS. The conclusion of its panel of experts was that AAS is indistinguishable from other farmed Atlantic salmon, is safe to eat and does not pose a threat to the environment under its conditions of use. Subsequently, the FDA initiated an EA in compliance with its obligations under the National Environment Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires that all federal agencies consider the possible environmental impacts of any action that they authorize. Subsequently, in November 2015, the FDA approved the New Animal Drug Application for the production, sale and consumption of AAS. AquaBounty is subject to on-going post approval responsibilities as detailed in the FDA letter of approval and summarized in the EA dated in November 2015. In the event that AquaBounty seeks to modify or expand its production sites and methods, the company may require further regulatory approvals. In May 2016, Health Canada concluded its review of AAS and approved it for commercial sale in Canada and the Animal Feed Division of the Animal Health Directorate of CFIA, authorized AAS for use in livestock feeds.
Regulation of self-limiting insect technologies
Oxitec has developed a GE self-limiting line of the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the OX513A, as well as other crop pests with the intent of suppressing these insects at the release site(s). While the GE mosquito was historically subject to regulatory review by FDA as a new animal drug, in 2017 jurisdiction was shifted to the EPA. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA, the EPA is charged with protecting human health and the environment by ensuring that registered pesticides do not cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment. FIFRA's definition of "pesticide" includes "any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest". Prior to this shift, the FDA published in August 2016 a final EA and FONSI regarding impacts on human health, animal health and the environment of the OX513A GE mosquito based on review of information and evidence related to an investigational trial in Key Haven, Florida. Following the transfer of jurisdiction to the EPA, Oxitec has submitted regulatory dossiers to the EPA necessary for the timely release of the OX513A GE mosquito in Florida and other states. The OX513A GE mosquito has also been approved by Brazil's CTNBio for unrestricted releases throughout the country. Additionally, open field trials of these mosquitoes have been conducted in Brazil, the Cayman Islands, Panama, and Malaysia under relevant permits or approvals. Further approvals will be required for commercial production and use.
Self-limiting GE insects used to control crop pestsâ€”instead of disease carrying vectorsâ€”are regulated by the USDA. Under the Plant Protection Act, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, has broad authority to regulate plant pests to protect crops and other plants. Because the objective of Oxitec's crop protection platform is to suppress known plant pests, these technologies are currently treated as subject to USDA's jurisdiction. When an applicant has developed sufficient data to demonstrate that the organism no longer poses a plant pest risk, the applicant can petition APHIS to "deregulate" the article, meaning the GE organism should no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS regulations. In 2017, APHIS released a final EA and subsequent FONSI supporting a limited environmental release of Oxitec's GE diamondback moth. This conclusion was based on the finding that it would be unlikely for these insects to impact the physical, biological and human health environment. These self-limiting insects will also likely be subject to foreign agriculture GE regulations and authorizing bodies, such as CTNBio and the Ministry of Agriculture in Brazil as well as the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator in Australia.
21

Regulation of agricultural technology/ food products
The manufacturing, marketing and certain areas of research related to some of the potential food products developed by us and our subsidiaries and collaborators are subject to regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States. As it relates to GE foods and/ or plants, they are subject to regulation by the FDA, USDA, and EPA under the US' Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology. These technologies have been regulated under this framework for over two decades. Similar regulatory approval systems are in place globally as biotech crops have been planted in over 26 countries in 2016. Okanagan's Arctic apple products are subject to such regulations.
The Arctic Apple has undergone significant regulatory review in recent years, and a few varieties have been successfully deregulated and authorized for sale in the United States. In February 2015, the USDA announced its decision to deregulate Okanagan's Golden Delicious apple variety and Granny Smith apple variety, or together the Arctic apples. In reaching its decision, the USDA conducted a final plant pest risk assessment concluding that Arctic apples are unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture and other plants in the United States. The USDA also completed an EA to comply with the NEPA and concluded that deregulation is not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment. Concurrent with the USDA, Okanagan also engaged in a voluntary food safety assessment consultation with the FDA regarding its Arctic apples. The FDA completed its assessment in March 2015. Based on the information provided by Okanagan and other information available to the agency, the FDA did not articulate any questions about safety or regulatory issues under the FDCA related to the product. As part of bringing the assessment to closure, Okanagan was required to submit summaries of its safety and nutritional assessments for its Arctic apples. In August 2016, the USDA announced its decision to extend a preliminary determination of nonregulated status to Okanagan's Arctic Fuji apple variety.
Comparable authorities to the federal and state governmental authorities in the United States are involved in other countries, such as the European Food Safety Authority in Europe and Health Canada in Canada. In relation to Okanagan, Health Canada announced its decision in March 2015 that it has no objection to the food use of the Arctic apple in Canada. In reaching its decision, Health Canada conducted a comprehensive assessment of the Golden Delicious and Granny Smith varieties according to its Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Novel Foods. These guidelines are consistent with internationally accepted principles for establishing the safety of foods with novel traits adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Following this assessment, it was determined that the changes made to the Arctic apple did not pose a greater risk to human health than apples currently available on the Canadian market. In addition, Health Canada also concluded that the Arctic apple would have no impact on allergies and that there are no differences in the nutritional value of the Arctic apple compared to other traditional apple varieties available for consumption.
Energy and chemical regulation
The environmental regulations discussed above also govern the development, manufacture and marketing of energy and chemical products. For example, the use of genetically-modified microorganisms, or GMMs, such as our yeast and methanotroph strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the EPA regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential products produced from GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is generally recognized as safe, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using GMMs, then our business will be adversely affected. 
Chemical products produced by us and our collaborators may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the TSCA, which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a "Chemical Abstracts Service" number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the REACH regulation. Additional regulations may apply to specific subsets of chemicals such as, for example, fuel products that are subject to regulation by various government agencies including, in the United States, the EPA and the California Air Resources Board.
