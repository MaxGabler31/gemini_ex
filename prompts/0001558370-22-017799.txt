Item 1 – Business
Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, any reference to “Pure Cycle,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” is to Pure Cycle Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
We are a diversified water resource and land development company. At our core, we are a wholesale water and wastewater service provider that develops land we own into master planned communities. Our newest business is the development of single-family homes held for rental purposes. Both the land development and single-family home rental lines of business generate customers and usage fees for our water and wastewater resource development business. 
Over the past 30+ years, we have accumulated a large portfolio of valuable water rights and land interests along the Front Range of Colorado. We have added an extensive network of wholesale water production, storage, treatment and distribution systems, and wastewater collection and treatment systems that we use to serve domestic, commercial, and industrial customers in the eastern Denver metropolitan region (the illustration below notes the general area of our land and water assets). Our primary land asset, known as Sky Ranch, is in one of the most active development areas in the Denver metropolitan region along the rapidly developing I-70 corridor, and we are developing lots at Sky Ranch for residential, commercial, retail, and light industrial uses. Sky Ranch is zoned to include up to 3,200 single family and multifamily homes, parks, open spaces, trails, recreational centers, schools, and over two million square feet of retail, commercial and light industrial space, all of which will be serviced by our water and wastewater resource development segment. Our newest line of business is our single-family rental business where we build single-family homes for rental purposes in Sky Ranch under annual lease agreements. We plan to expand this new line of business to more than 200 rental units over the next several years. 
Through our land development segment, we develop master planned communities creating value and opportunity for investors, homeowners, water customers, and businesses along the busy I-70 corridor of the Denver metropolitan area. Our land development segment was borne from our desire to capitalize on the increase in the value water provides to raw land in the Colorado front range. 
Our land development activities provide a strategic complement to our water and wastewater resource development business, and vice versa. A significant component of any master planned community is its ability to bring high quality domestic water, irrigation water, and wastewater services to the community. Having control over the water resources in conjunction with developing the land enables us to efficiently build and maintain infrastructure for potable water and irrigation water distribution, wastewater and storm water collection,

roads, parks, open spaces, and other investments. It also enables us to efficiently align construction and delivery of these investments with phased take-down commitments from our home builder customers, minimizing significant excess capacity or downtime with these significant investments. By being the landowner, land developer, and water/wastewater provider, we believe we offer a more efficient development process, with more competitive lot pricing, which results in a more affordable and marketable product. 
Our water and land assets are designed, constructed, operated, and maintained by us. Our water and land activities are each a distinct line of business which are operated as separate, but cohesive business segments. We refer to these segments as our water and wastewater resource development segment and our land development segment, both of which are described in greater detail below. In March 2021, we launched a new line of business which will be referred to as our single-family home rental line of business. During Phase 1 of the development of Sky Ranch, we retained ownership of four residential lots, on which we built or are building single-family homes which we own, maintain, and rent to qualified renters. We have contracted for the construction of ten homes with a reputable home builder in Phase 2A, and we expect these homes to be completed and ready for renters at various dates throughout our fiscal 2023. We anticipate that this single-family home rental business will become our third segment when it is material to our operations.

Water and Wastewater Resource Development Segment
We own or control the water and infrastructure required to (i) withdraw, treat, store and deliver water (i.e., water rights, wells, diversion structures, pipelines, reservoirs and treatment facilities required to extract and use the water); (ii) collect, treat, store and reuse wastewater (i.e., we design, build, and operate water treatment and wastewater reclamation facilities); and (iii) treat and deliver reclaimed water for irrigation use (i.e., we use and reuse our valuable water supplies through non-potable irrigation systems to irrigate parks and open spaces).
Our water supplies, which can be used in our exclusive service area and other areas along the eastern I-70 corridor, enable us to add significant value to our land development segment by bringing water to land that does not have water for development and enhance the value of that land, as well as our water resources, to a greater extent than either a traditional water utility or land developer can. Having a valuable portfolio of water in a water short region provides us with a competitive advantage over other land developers who may be required to buy expensive water, pay significant fees to another water provider, in lieu of buying water, and/or wait for a city to annex property and extend costly water and wastewater infrastructure to the property before development can begin. Having our own water supply gives us more control over the land entitlement and development process and the ability to capitalize on the value of our water rights. In addition, we have significant in-house expertise in engineering, operations, and land development which allows us to take a hands-on approach to the water and land development process.
We mainly provide wholesale water and wastewater services to local governmental entities that in turn provide residential and commercial water and wastewater services to customers in their communities. Our largest customer is the Rangeview Metropolitan District (Rangeview District). We have the exclusive right to provide water and wastewater services to the Rangeview District’s customers in its exclusive 24,000-acre service area in the southeastern Denver metropolitan area pursuant to various agreements that are described in greater detail below. As of August 31, 2022, through the Rangeview District, we provide service to more than 1,000 single-family equivalent (SFE) water connections and more than 700 SFE wastewater connections. These connections are located mainly in the southeastern metropolitan Denver area on the Lowry Range, at our Sky Ranch development and other nearby areas where we have acquired service rights. With the water rights we own and control, we believe we can serve an estimated 60,000 SFEs. An SFE is a customer, whether residential, commercial, or industrial, that imparts a demand on our water or wastewater systems based on the demand of a family of four persons living in a single-family house on a standard sized lot. For some instances herein, as context dictates, the term “acre-feet” (which is approximately 326,000 gallons) is used to designate an annual decreed amount of water available during a typical year.
In addition to our domestic customers, we provide raw water for oil and gas operations. Multiple operators lease more than 135,000 acres in and adjacent to our service area with more than 100 wells and miles of oil and gas collection lines. Sales of water to industrial customers in the oil and gas industry are unpredictable and fluctuate dramatically. In late 2021 and throughout 2022, we saw a significant recovery in the oil and gas markets, and this resulted in additional water sales to oil and gas clients in our fiscal 2022 and 2021.
Land Development Segment
In 2010 we purchased approximately 930 acres of land known as Sky Ranch. The illustration on the next page provides our planned overall layout of Sky Ranch. We acquired Sky Ranch with the intention of selling lots to home builders to add value to our core water and wastewater operations by adding the ultimate purchasers of the homes as our water customers. Sky Ranch is being developed in phases over several years, which began in June 2017, when we entered into agreements with three national home builders to sell the initial 505 residential lots at Sky Ranch (referred to as Phase 1), and has continued when in February 2021, we entered contracts with four national homebuilders for approximately 850 residential lots, in what we call Phase 2 of the Sky Ranch Development. We have divided Phase 2 into four subphases that we refer to as Phases 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D. The Phase 1 lots and the lots being developed in Phase 2A and 2B are shown in the map below. 
​

Illustrative map of the Sky Ranch Master Planned Community
​
As of August 31, 2022, we have delivered to homebuilders all 505 lots in Phase 1 and 219 lots in Phase 2A of the Sky Ranch development. In addition, we retained four lots in Phase 1 for our single-family rental business and ten lots in Phase 2A for the single-family rental business (bringing total lots to 509 in Phase 1 and 229 in Phase 2A). As of August 31, 2022, homebuilders have built and sold 473 homes at Sky Ranch, with another approximately 90 homes under construction. In addition, we completed three rental units, which have been rented since November 2021, and began construction on the next eleven units. All Phase 1 lots in Sky Ranch are complete and all public improvements have been accepted by the various governmental entities that will control and maintain the infrastructure.
In February 2021, we broke ground on Phase 2 lots at Sky Ranch, which will include 850 residential lots, for which we have contracted to sell 804 finished lots to four homebuilders who will construct attached and detached single-family residential homes. We retained 46

lots which we will use in our single-family rental business. As of August 31, 2022, we have closed on the 219 lots in Phase 2A sold to the home builders and are completing landscaping and other items required under the sales contracts. We believe we will complete all our required construction items in Phase 2A in the next twelve months. We believe it will take three years to complete all construction and sell all the finished lots in all four subphases of Phase 2, depending on the market conditions and permitting process. 
As disclosed in March 2021, a new Charter School, Sky Ranch Academy, was formed for the purposes of partnering with the Bennett School District 29J to operate a new K-12 Charter School to be located at Sky Ranch. Sky Ranch Academy has partnered with National Heritage Academy (NHA) to operate the charter. NHA brings more than 25 years of experience providing educational services at 100 schools in nine states, educating more than 60,000 students including four other schools in Colorado. Sky Ranch Academy is expected to open in August 2023.
Single-Family Rentals
The past several years the housing market and home prices in Colorado grew at double-digit rates. In recent months this growth has tapered in many markets, specifically in higher priced homes. As mortgage rates increase, and the average price of homes in Colorado continues to increase, we believe rental units are increasingly necessary to provide affordable housing options to the growing population in Colorado. Additionally, more than any other time in the USA, we have seen a shift from people having to rent to people choosing to rent. We believe this shift will continue to shape the housing market for the foreseeable future. To capitalize on the growing single-family rental market, in 2021 we launched our single-family rental division. We contracted with a local semi-custom home builder to construct four single-family detached homes on four lots in Phase 1 at Sky Ranch that we retained for use in our rental division. Three of the homes were completed and rented in November 2021. With the initial success of our first three rental homes, during fiscal 2022, we began construction on eleven more homes we will use in our rental division upon completion (expected to be completed and ready for rental at various dates throughout our fiscal 2023). These rental units represent the initial investment into what we expect to become our third operating segment as we expect to add 46 homes in Phase 2 with the ability to add more than 100 more units in the near term. We believe having ongoing recurring rental income, in a community we are heavily involved with, which is experiencing double digit growth in home values provides tremendous upside potential for growing our balance sheet and diversifying our recurring revenue streams.
Our Water Assets
We use our valuable and growing water and land assets to conduct our water and land development operations. Our water assets are summarized in the table below and further discussed in this section:

Rangeview Water Supply
The Rangeview Water Supply consists of 26,985 acre-feet of tributary surface water, non-tributary groundwater, and not non-tributary groundwater. Additionally, the Rangeview Water Supply has 26,000 acre-feet of adjudicated reservoir sites. Terminology typically used in the water industry that may help readers understand water rights are detailed below.

● | Non-Tributary Groundwater – groundwater located outside the boundaries of any designated groundwater basins in existence on January 1, 1985, the withdrawal of which will not, within one hundred years of continuous withdrawal, deplete the flow of a natural stream at an annual rate greater than one-tenth of one percent of the annual rate of withdrawal.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Not Non-Tributary Groundwater – statutorily defined as groundwater located within those portions of the Dawson, Denver, Arapahoe, and Laramie Fox-Hill aquifers outside of designated basins that does not meet the definition of “non-tributary.”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tributary Groundwater – all water located in an aquifer that is hydrologically connected to a natural stream such that depletion has an impact on the surface stream.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designated Groundwater – renewable and sustainable groundwater from certain areas of Colorado designated by the Colorado Ground Water Commission subject to management under the Colorado Ground Water Commission’s rules.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tributary Surface Water – water on the surface of the ground flowing in a stream or river system.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rangeview Water Supply is principally located in the southeast Denver metropolitan area at the “Lowry Range,” which is land owned by the State Board of Land Commissioners (Land Board) and is described below.
We acquired our Rangeview Water Supply through the following agreements:

● | The 1996 Amended and Restated Lease Agreement between the Land Board and the Rangeview District, which was superseded by the 2014 Amended and Restated Lease Agreement, dated July 10, 2014 (Lease), among us, the Land Board, and the Rangeview District;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The 1996 Service Agreement between us and the Rangeview District, which was superseded by the Amended and Restated Service Agreement, dated July 11, 2014, between us and the Rangeview District (Lowry Service Agreement), which allows us to provide water service to the Rangeview District’s customers located on the Lowry Range;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Agreement for Sale of non-tributary and not non-tributary groundwater between us and the Rangeview District (Export Agreement), pursuant to which we purchased a portion of the Rangeview Water Supply that we refer to as our “Export Water” because the Export Agreement allows us to export this water from the Lowry Range to supply water to nearby communities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The 1997 Wastewater Service Agreement between us and Rangeview District (Lowry Wastewater Agreement), which allows us to provide wastewater service to the Rangeview District’s customers on the Lowry Range.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Lease, the Lowry Service Agreement, the Export Agreement, and the Lowry Wastewater Agreement are collectively referred to as the “Rangeview Water Agreements.”
We provide wholesale water service and wastewater service to customers located both on and outside of the Lowry Range, including customers of the Rangeview District and other governmental entities, and industrial and commercial customers. Pursuant to service agreements with Rangeview (including the Lowry Service Agreement, the Lowry Wastewater Agreement and the Non-Lowry Service Agreement described below), we design, construct, operate and maintain the Rangeview District’s water and wastewater systems that are used to provide water and wastewater services to the Rangeview District’s customers located within the Rangeview District’s exclusive service area, and other approved areas. Subject to the terms and conditions of our agreements with the Rangeview District, we are the exclusive water and wastewater provider to the Rangeview District’s customers. For the Rangeview District’s customers located on the Lowry Range, we operate both the water and the wastewater systems during our contract period on behalf of the Rangeview 

9



District, which owns the facilities for both systems. At the expiration of our contract term in 2081, ownership of the water system facilities located on the Lowry Range used to deliver water to customers on the Lowry Range will revert to the Land Board, with the Rangeview District retaining ownership of any wastewater facilities located on the Lowry Range. The water system and related facilities used to deliver water to customers off the Lowry Range (including Export Water) will remain with us and the Rangeview District. 
The Rangeview Water Agreements grant us the right to use approximately 26,000 acre-feet of surface reservoir capacity to provide water service to customers both on and off the Lowry Range.
Fairgrounds Water
The fairgrounds water represents groundwater rights we acquired from Arapahoe County in conjunction with us entering into water service agreements with the county for the Arapahoe County Fairgrounds. We use this water with our overall Rangeview Water Supply for supplying water services throughout our service area.
Sky Ranch Water Supply
As part of the acquisition of the Sky Ranch land in 2010, we also acquired the 828 acre-feet of water located beneath the property. The water is being used as part of our overall water distribution system, which includes providing services to the Sky Ranch Master Planned Community.
Lost Creek Water Supply
The “Lost Creek Water” is comprised of water rights we acquired in 2019 and 2022 in the Lost Creek Designated Ground Water Basin. In August 2019, we purchased 300 acre-feet of designated groundwater and 220 acre-feet of groundwater and ditch water. In June 2022, we purchased 370 acre-feet of designated groundwater. All the Lost Creek Water has been changed for use as municipal/industrial water, additionally we have filed an application with the Colorado Water Court to use the Lost Creek Water to augment our municipal/industrial water supplies at the Lowry Range. Our plans are to consolidate our Lost Creek Water with our Rangeview Water Supply to provide service to the Rangeview District’s customers both on and off the Lowry Range.
The Lowry Range Property
The Lowry Range consists of nearly 26,000 acres, or 40 square miles, of primarily undeveloped land in unincorporated Arapahoe County. It is located 20 miles southeast of downtown Denver and is one of the largest contiguous parcels under single ownership next to a major metropolitan area in the United States. Pursuant to our agreements with the Land Board, we, together with the Rangeview District, have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to 24,000 acres of the Lowry Range.
The Rangeview District
The Rangeview District is a quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State of Colorado formed in 1986 for the purpose of providing water and wastewater services to the Lowry Range and other approved areas. The Rangeview District is governed by an elected board of directors. Eligible voters and persons eligible to serve as directors of the Rangeview District must own an interest in property within the boundaries of the Rangeview District. We own certain rights and real property interests which encompass the current boundaries of the Rangeview District. The current directors of the Rangeview District are Mark W. Harding (our President, Chief Executive Officer, and a director), Kevin B. McNeill (our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), Scott E. Lehman (an employee of ours), Dirk Lashnits (an employee of ours), and one independent board member. Pursuant to Colorado law, directors may receive $100 for each board meeting they attend, up to a maximum of $1,600 per year. Messrs. Harding, McNeill, Lehman, and Lashnits have all elected to forego these payments.
Land Board Royalties and Fees
Water Deliveries – Pursuant to the Rangeview Water Agreements, the Land Board is entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of revenues earned from water sales that use the Rangeview Water Supply. The calculation of royalties depends on the location of the customer and whether the customer is a public or private entity. The Land Board does not receive a royalty from wastewater services. When we develop, operate, and deliver water from our Rangeview Water Supply, the Land Board receives royalties on the gross revenues 

10



at a rate of 12% from water delivered to all customers located on the Lowry Range and to all private customers located off the Lowry Range and 10% from public entity customers located off the Lowry Range. In the event that (i) metered production of water used on the Lowry Range in any calendar year exceeds 13,000 acre-feet or (ii) 10,000 acres of land on the Lowry Range have been rezoned to non-agricultural use, finally platted and water tap agreements have been entered into with respect to all improvements to be constructed on such acreage, the Land Board may elect, at its option, to receive (in lieu of its royalty of 12% from customers on the Lowry Range), 50% of the collective net profits (ours and the Rangeview District’s) derived from the sale or other disposition of water on the Lowry Range. To date, neither of these conditions has been met, and such conditions are not likely to be met any time soon. In addition to royalties on the sale of metered water deliveries, the Land Board will receive a royalty of two percent (2%) of the gross amount received from the sale of water taps to be served by the Rangeview Water Supply, except for the sale of any taps to Sky Ranch. Escalated royalties will be owed if we sell our Export Water outright rather than delivering water service. We do not currently anticipate selling our Export Water.
Annual Production Fee – We are also required to pre-pay the Land Board a minimum annual water royalty of $46,000 per year, which is credited against earned royalties each year.
Annual Rent – We pay the Land Board annual rent under the Lease of $8,400, which amount is increased every five years based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers. The next increase will occur in 2026.
South Metropolitan Water Supply Authority (SMWSA) and Water Infrastructure Supply Efficiency Partnership (WISE)
SMWSA is a municipal water authority in Colorado organized to pursue the acquisition and development of water supplies on behalf of its members, which include the Rangeview District. SMWSA members include 14 Denver area water providers in Arapahoe and Douglas Counties. Pursuant to certain agreements between us and the Rangeview District, we agreed to provide funding to enable the Rangeview District to acquire rights to water projects undertaken by SMWSA, including rights to water supplied pursuant to the cooperative water project known as WISE. WISE provides for the purchase and construction of infrastructure (such as pipelines, water storage facilities, water treatment facilities, and other appurtenant facilities) to deliver water to and among the 10 members of the South Metro WISE Authority (SMWA), consisting of the Rangeview District and nine other SMWSA members, from the City and County of Denver acting through its Board of Water Commissioners (Denver Water) and the City of Aurora acting by and through its utility enterprise (Aurora Water). In exchange for funding the Rangeview District’s WISE obligations, we have the exclusive right to use and reuse the Rangeview District’s share of WISE water (approximately 9%) and infrastructure to provide water service to the Rangeview District’s customers and to receive the revenue from providing those services. Our current WISE subscription entitles us to approximately three million gallons per day of transmission pipeline capacity and increasing acre-feet of water per year as noted below.
​

​ | ​ | ​ 
-----------------------------+---+-----------------------
Water Year (June 1 - May 31) | ​ | Acre-feet Subscription
2023 | ​ | 600 
2024 | | 700 
2025 | | 800 
2026 and thereafter | | 900 

​
The cost of the water to the members is based on the water rates charged by Aurora Water and can be adjusted each January 1. As of January 1, 2021, WISE water was $5.98 per thousand gallons and such rate remained in effect through calendar 2021. Effective, January 1, 2022, WISE water increased to $6.13 per thousand gallons, which will be in effect for all of calendar 2022. In addition, we pay certain system operational and construction costs. If a WISE member, including the Rangeview District, does not need its WISE water each year or a member needs additional water, the members can trade and/or buy and sell water amongst themselves. For the year ended August 31, 2022, we, through the Rangeview District, purchased a total of just over 360 acre-feet of WISE water for $0.7 million. For the year ended August 31, 2021, we, through the Rangeview District, purchased a total of just under 320 acre-feet of WISE water for $0.6 million.
During the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, we provided $0.9 and $1.1 million of financing to the Rangeview District to fund the Rangeview District’s obligation to purchase WISE water rights and pay for operational and construction charges. Ongoing funding requirements are dependent on the WISE water subscription amount and the Rangeview District’s allocable share of the operational and overhead costs of SMWA and construction activities related to delivery of WISE water.

11



Additionally, in 2021 the Rangeview District entered into an agreement with WISE to construct special facilities for $0.6 million. The construction of these special facilities began in our fiscal 2021 and was completed in our fiscal 2022. We funded the construction of the special facilities, and the Rangeview District remitted the entire $0.6 million it received to us.
East Cherry Creek Valley System
Pursuant to a 1982 agreement, the Rangeview District may purchase water from East Cherry Creek Valley Water and Sanitation District’s (ECCV) Land Board system. ECCV’s Land Board system is comprised of eight wells and more than ten miles of buried water pipeline located on the Lowry Range. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement to operate and maintain the ECCV facilities allowing us to utilize the system to provide water to commercial and industrial customers, including hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas wells. The agreement allows us to use the ECCV system through April 30, 2032, in exchange for a flat monthly fee and a fee per 1,000 gallons of water produced from ECCV’s system, which is included in the water usage fees charged to customers.
Sources of Water and Wastewater Service Revenues
Our water and wastewater resource development segment generates revenue from the following sources, described in greater detail below:

● | Monthly metered water usage and wastewater treatment fees
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | One-time water and wastewater tap (connection) fees
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Construction and special facility funding fees
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Consulting fees, and
--+---------------------


● | Industrial – oil and gas operations fees
--+-----------------------------------------

​
Monthly Metered Water Usage and Wastewater Treatment Fees
Monthly metered water usage fees are assessed to customers based on actual deliveries each month. Water usage fees are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water. The water usage fees for customers on the Lowry Range are noted in the tables below:
Current Lowry Range tiered potable water usage pricing structure
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------------------------------------+---+---+------
Base charge per SFE per month | | $ | 32.74
Price ($ per thousand gallons used per month) | ​ | ​ | ​ 
0 gallons to 15,000 gallons | ​ | $ | 4.63 
15,000 gallons to 30,000 gallons | ​ | $ | 8.10 
30,000 gallons and above | ​ | $ | 9.95

Base charge per SFE per month | | $ | 32.74
Price ($ per thousand gallons used per month) | ​ | ​ | ​ 
0 gallons to 15,000 gallons | ​ | $ | 3.94 
15,000 gallons to 30,000 gallons | ​ | $ | 6.89 
30,000 gallons and above | ​ | $ | 8.46 

​
The figures in the table above reflect the amounts charged to the Rangeview District’s end-use customers on the Lowry Range. Pursuant to the Lease, the amounts charged by the Rangeview District to its end-use customers on the Lowry Range cannot exceed the average of similar rates and charges of three surrounding municipal water and wastewater service providers. In exchange for providing water service to the Rangeview District’s Lowry Range customers, we receive 98% of the usage charges received by the Rangeview District relating to water services after deducting the required royalty to the Land Board (described above at Rangeview Water Supply – Land Board Royalties and Fees).

12



The amounts charged by the Rangeview District to its end-use customers off the Lowry Range are determined pursuant to the Rangeview District’s service agreements with such customers and such rates may vary. In exchange for providing water service to the Rangeview District’s customers off the Lowry Range, we receive 98% of the usage charges received by the Rangeview District relating to water services after deducting any required royalty to the Land Board. The royalty to the Land Board is required for water service provided utilizing our Rangeview Water Supply, which includes most of our current customers off the Lowry Range except those at the Elbert & Highway 86 Commercial District (also known as “Wild Pointe” described below).
We sell bulk water at a rate of $14.76 per thousand gallons to commercial and industrial customers via hydrant meters or metered fill stations.
We also collect other immaterial fees and charges from customers and other users to cover miscellaneous administrative and service expenses, such as application fees, review fees, reinspection fees, and permit fees.
In exchange for providing wastewater services, we receive 90% of the Rangeview District’s monthly wastewater treatment fees, as well as the right to use or sell the reclaimed water.
Water and Wastewater Tap Fees
We generate significant revenues from fees charged to customers to connect to our water and wastewater systems. These fees are known as tap fees. The tap fee is a non-refundable fee that is payable typically at the time a building permit is granted for construction of a home or business and authorizes the property to connect to the water or wastewater system. Once granted, the right stays with the property. We have no obligation to physically connect the property to the lines; this is typically done by the homebuilder. Once connected to the water and/or wastewater systems, the property has live service, and the customer can receive metered water deliveries from our system and send wastewater into our system. Thus, the customer has full control of the connection right as it can obtain all the benefits from this right. Our systems are “wholesale facilities,” namely those assets used to deliver water and wastewater to a service area or major regions or portions thereof. Wells, treatment plants, pump stations, tanks, reservoirs, transmission pipelines, and major sewage lift stations are typical examples of wholesale facilities.
The Rangeview District’s 2022 water tap fees are $28,308 per SFE, and its wastewater tap fees are $4,944. The Rangeview District assesses its tap and usage fees annually and adjusts the rates as necessary.
In exchange for providing water service to the Rangeview District’s customers using the Rangeview Water Supply (other than taps to Sky Ranch, which are exempt), we receive 98% of the Rangeview District’s tap fees and the Land Board receives the remaining two percent as a royalty. In exchange for providing wastewater services, whether to customers on or off the Lowry Range, we receive 100% of the Rangeview District’s wastewater tap fees.
Construction and Special Facility Funding Fees
Construction and Special Facility Funding fees are fees we receive, typically in advance, from developers for us to build infrastructure that is normally the responsibility of the developer because the facilities service only the developer’s property. Those type of facilities may include retail facilities, which distribute water to and collect wastewater from an individual subdivision or a community, and special facilities, which are required to extend services to an individual development and are not otherwise classified as a typical wholesale facility or retail facilities. Temporary infrastructure required prior to construction of permanent water and wastewater systems or transmission pipelines to transfer water from one location to another are examples of special facilities. Once we certify that the special facilities have been constructed in accordance with our design criteria, the developer dedicates the special facilities to the Rangeview District, and we operate and maintain the facilities on behalf of Rangeview.
Consulting Fees
Consulting fees are fees we receive, typically monthly, from municipalities and area water providers for whom we provide contract operation services.

Industrial – Oil and Gas Operations Fees
We provide water for oil and gas operators that are performing hydraulic fracturing, mainly in the Niobrara Formation on and around our service area and our Sky Ranch property. These fees are paid based on the metered gallons of water delivered. Oil and gas drilling in our area is affected by the price of oil and state, local and federal government regulations. The number of wells drilled vary from year to year. Each well utilizes between 10 and 20 million gallons of water during the hydraulic fracturing process, which equates to selling water to between approximately 100 and 200 homes for an entire year. With a large percentage of the acreage surrounding the Lowry Range in Arapahoe, Adams, Elbert, and portions of Douglas Counties already leased by oil companies, we anticipate continuing to provide water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the future.
Service to Customers Not on the Lowry Range
In addition to customers on the Lowry Range, we have an agreement with the Rangeview District to be its exclusive water and wastewater service provider throughout its service area. This includes the design, construction, operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems to serve the Rangeview District’s customers located outside the Lowry Range service area (for example Wild Pointe and Sky Ranch) (Non-Lowry Service Agreement). In exchange for providing water and wastewater services to the Rangeview District’s customers that are not on the Lowry Range, we receive 100% of water and wastewater tap fees, 98% of the water usage fees, and 90% of the monthly wastewater service and usage fees received by the Rangeview District from these customers, after deduction of royalties due to the Land Board, if applicable (i.e., if we use a portion of the Rangeview Water Supply, such as the Export Water, to provide service to such customers). We are currently not using the Rangeview Water Supply at Sky Ranch, but we may do so in the future, in which case water usage fees to be collected for such service would become subject to the Land Board royalty.
Sky Ranch Water and Wastewater Service – As described in more detail below, we are developing approximately 930 acres of land as a Master Planned Community known as Sky Ranch. Pursuant to the Non-Lowry Service Agreement, we are the exclusive provider of water and wastewater services to all current and future residents, businesses, and other water users at the Sky Ranch development.
Wild Pointe – Elbert & Highway 86 Commercial Metropolitan District – In 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Rangeview District, which had entered into an agreement with Elbert & Highway 86 Commercial Metropolitan District (Elbert 86 District), to operate and maintain a water system for residential and commercial customers at the Wild Pointe development in Elbert County. The water system includes two deep water wells, a pump station, treatment facility, storage facility, over eight miles of transmission lines, and over 450 acre-feet of water rights serving Wild Pointe. We provided $1.6 million in funding to acquire the exclusive rights to operate and maintain all the water facilities in exchange for payment of the remaining residential and commercial tap fees and annual water use fees. Service to Wild Pointe is governed by the Non-Lowry Service Agreement.
Our Land Development Assets – Sky Ranch
In 2010, we purchased approximately 930 acres of undeveloped land in unincorporated Arapahoe County, which we are actively developing as the master planned community known as Sky Ranch. With the property acquisition, we also acquired nearly 830 acre-feet of water beneath Sky Ranch and approximately 640 acres of oil and gas mineral rights. Sky Ranch is located 16 miles east of downtown Denver, four miles north of the Lowry Range, and four miles south of Denver International Airport.
Sky Ranch is zoned for residential, commercial, and retail uses, including up to 3,200 homes and more than two million square feet of commercial, retail, and light industrial development. See illustration above for the current layout of Sky Ranch. The development of Sky Ranch will occur in multiple filings and phases which will take several years to complete. Phase 1 of Sky Ranch included more than 150 acres and has a total of 509 detached single-family residential lots. Of the 509 lots, we sold 505 finished lots to homebuilders, all of which were sold as of August 31, 2021, and retained the remaining lots for use in our single-family home rental business. In February 2021, we began construction on Phase 2 of the development, which will include 850 lots of which we have contracted to sell 804 lots to home builders for detached and attached single-family homes, and the remaining 46 lots we plan to use for our single-family home rental business. Phase 2 is approximately 250 acres and will be constructed in four subphases which we refer to as Phase 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D. Development activities for Phase 2A, consisting of 229 lots, began in February 2021, and by August 31, 2022, we had substantially completed construction and transferred 219 lots to the four homebuilders. We retained ten lots in Phase 2A on which we are constructing units for our single-family rental business. The total sales price for the 804 lots sold to the homebuilders is $65.0 million, which is subject to price escalations depending on development timing which are not included in that figure. The total sales price for the 219 lots in Phase 2A is $18.4 million. Our preliminary total cost estimates for developing all 229 lots in Phase 2A is $20.4 million, with 

14



approximately $17.8 million of that estimated to be spent on public improvements which are eligible for reimbursement by the Sky Ranch CAB. See below for a description of the conditions that may limit our ability to receive reimbursables and a definition of the Sky Ranch CAB.
As the land developer, we are providing finished lots (i.e. lots ready for building permits to construct homes) to each of the home builders. We build, or contract to build, the roads, curbs, wet and dry utilities, storm drains, parks, open spaces, and other related improvements as part of a fully master planned community. Each builder is required to purchase water and wastewater taps for each lot from the Rangeview District at the time a building permit is issued. The cost of the water and wastewater tap for a lot depends on the size of the lot, the size of the house, and the amount of irrigated landscaping. Pursuant to the Non-Lowry Service Agreement, we receive all the water and wastewater tap fees from tap sales at Sky Ranch and 98% of the ongoing monthly water and wastewater service revenues.
Public improvements, such as roads, parks, and water and sanitary sewer mains, storm sewer, and drainage improvements, that are shared by all homeowners in the development and not specific to any private finished lot are ultimately owned by the governmental metropolitan district or other municipality that is responsible for the maintenance of the improvements. Upon completion and acceptance of certain public improvements by the “Sky Ranch Districts” or the Sky Ranch CAB (both of which are defined below), we are entitled to receive reimbursement for the verified public improvement costs. Pursuant to certain agreements with the Sky Ranch Districts and the Sky Ranch CAB, on their behalf we construct public infrastructure such as roads, curbs, storm water, drainage, sidewalks, parks, open space, trails etc., which costs are reimbursed to us by the Sky Ranch CAB, through funds generated by the Sky Ranch Districts through taxes, fees, or the issuance of municipal bonds. See Note 2 and Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements regarding treatment and recognition of these public improvement costs.
Pursuant to our service agreements, we are required to construct all required wholesale water and wastewater improvements (i.e., a wastewater reclamation facility, water supply, storage, treatment, and other wholesale facilities) for the provision of water and wastewater service to the property. As of August 31, 2022, we have completed the required wholesale facilities and other infrastructure to provide water for the first 900 homes and wastewater for over 2,000 homes at Sky Ranch. The most significant wholesale facility built was the wastewater reclamation facility, which cost $10.2 million and has a designed capacity to provide wastewater for more than 2,000 single-family homes before requiring expansion. This allows the treatment facility to process wastewater for several development phases at Sky Ranch before additional investment is needed to increase its capacity.
We expect to have other phases developing concurrently with the second phase that could include commercial, retail, and light industrial sites. We expect full development of the Sky Ranch Master Planned Community to take another eight to ten years depending on market conditions.
Pursuant to the Sky Ranch Water and Wastewater Service Agreement, dated June 19, 2017, between PCY Holdings, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that holds title to the Sky Ranch land), and the Rangeview District, PCY Holdings, LLC, agreed to construct certain facilities necessary to provide water and wastewater service to Sky Ranch. The Rangeview District, through us as its exclusive service provider, agreed to provide water and wastewater services to the Sky Ranch property. We have installed over 15.5 miles of water delivery and wastewater collection infrastructure at a cost of $4.9 million, which is reimbursable by the Sky Ranch CAB as outlined in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We have also leased the oil and gas minerals underlying the property to a major independent exploration and production company.
Sky Ranch Metropolitan Districts
The Sky Ranch Metropolitan District Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are quasi-municipal corporations and political subdivisions of Colorado formed for the purpose of providing services to the Sky Ranch property (Sky Ranch Districts). The Sky Ranch Districts are governed by an elected board of directors. Eligible voters and persons eligible to serve as directors of the Sky Ranch Districts must own an interest in property within the boundaries of the district. We own certain rights and real property interests which encompass the current boundaries of the districts and certain of our employees serve on the boards of directors of the Sky Ranch Districts. The current directors of the districts are Mark W. Harding (our President, Chief Executive Officer, and a director), Kevin B. McNeill (our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), Scott E. Lehman (our employee), Dirk Lashnits (an employee of ours), and one independent board member. Pursuant to Colorado law, directors may receive $100 for each board meeting they attend, up to a maximum of $1,600 per year. Messrs. Harding, McNeill, Lehman, and Lashnits have all elected to forego these payments.

Sky Ranch Community Authority Board
Districts No. 1 and 5 of the Sky Ranch Districts, formed the Sky Ranch Community Authority Board (Sky Ranch CAB) to, among other things, design, construct, finance, operate and maintain certain public improvements for the benefit of the property within the boundaries and/or service area of the Sky Ranch Districts. In order for the public improvements to be constructed and/or acquired, it is necessary for each Sky Ranch District and/or the Sky Ranch CAB to be able to fund the improvements and pay its ongoing operations and maintenance expenses related to the provision of services that benefit the property. We entered into agreements, first with Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 1 in 2014 and later with the Sky Ranch CAB, that require us to fund expenses related to the construction of an agreed upon list of public improvements for the Sky Ranch Master Planned Community.
We and the Sky Ranch CAB entered into a Facilities Funding and Acquisition Agreement (FFAA) effective November 2017, obligating us to advance funding to the Sky Ranch CAB for specified public improvements constructed from 2018 to 2023. All amounts owed under the FFAA bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum. Any advances not paid or reimbursed by the Sky Ranch CAB by December 31, 2058, for Phase 1 and December 31, 2060, for Phase 2A, shall be deemed forever discharged and satisfied in full. Advances and verified costs expended by us for expenses related to the construction of the agreed upon public improvements are reimbursable to us by the Sky Ranch CAB. No repayment is required of the Sky Ranch CAB for advances made or expenses incurred related to the construction of public improvements unless and until the Sky Ranch CAB and/or Sky Ranch Districts generate sufficient funds from property taxes, fees, or the issuance of bonds in an amount sufficient to reimburse us for all or a portion of advances or other public improvement expenses incurred. The Sky Ranch CAB agrees to exercise reasonable efforts to issue bonds to reimburse us subject to certain limitations. In addition, the Sky Ranch CAB agrees to utilize any available moneys not otherwise pledged to payment of debt or used for operation and maintenance expenses to reimburse us. Since 2017, we have advanced the Sky Ranch CAB a total of $42.1 million for funding the construction of the public improvements. The Sky Ranch CAB has remitted the following amounts to us for repayment of public improvements and the related interest.
​

● | In November 2019, the Sky Ranch CAB issued bonds and repaid $10.5 million
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In January 2021, the Sky Ranch CAB repaid $0.4 million from unencumbered funds resulting from a budget surplus in 2021
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2022, the Sky Ranch CAB repaid $0.1 million from unencumbered funds resulting from a budget surplus in 2022
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In August 2022, the Sky Ranch CAB issued bonds and repaid $23.6 million
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Prior to our fiscal 2021, the reimbursable expenditures we funded were expensed through land development construction costs, and project management revenue and interest income were not recognized as the reimbursement was deemed contingent on a sufficient tax base and/or the issuance of municipal bonds for collectability to be considered probable. As Sky Ranch continues to grow, housing values increased, and the Sky Ranch CAB demonstrated the ability to repay the amounts owed to us, the collectability of reimbursable expenditures incurred to date has been determined to be probable; Therefore, during fiscal 2021 we recognized the remaining reimbursable costs, project management fees, and interest. During the year ended August 31, 2021, we recognized $21.7 million as a note receivable – related party with the offsetting entries being to other income, project management revenue and interest income for costs deemed reimbursable from the Sky Ranch CAB. Due to continue growth and the continued belief the Sky Ranch CAB can repay amounts we spend on public improvements, Phase 2 reimbursable public improvements, along with the project management revenue, and interest income are being recorded as a note receivable from the Sky Ranch CAB as incurred. Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements summarizes the changes to the note receivable. The Sky Ranch CAB has an obligation to repay us but the ability of the Sky Ranch CAB to repay us before the contractual termination dates is dependent upon the establishment of a tax base or other fee generating activities sufficient to recover reimbursable costs incurred. Costs incurred will be recognized as land under development costs or notes receivable – related party, depending on whether collectability is deemed to be considered probable. In addition to the note receivable balance, the Sky Ranch CAB refunded $0.5 million for the reimbursement of construction costs from the Southeast Metropolitan Storm Water Authority (SEMSWA). These costs were distributed to the Sky Ranch CAB upon the acceptance of the stormwater infrastructure by SEMSWA during our fiscal 2022.
​
The current directors of the Sky Ranch CAB are Mark W. Harding (our President, Chief Executive Officer, and a director), Kevin B. McNeill (our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), Scott E. Lehman (our employee), Dirk Lashnits (our employee), and one independent board member. Pursuant to Colorado law, directors may receive $100 for each board meeting they attend, up to a maximum of $1,600 per year. Messrs. Harding, McNeill, Lehman, and Lashnits have all elected to forego these payments.

Other Assets
Oil and Gas Leases
In 2011, we entered into an Oil and Gas Lease (Sky Ranch O&G Lease) and Surface Use and Damage Agreement and received an up-front payment and a 20% of gross proceeds royalty (less certain taxes) from the sale of any oil and gas produced from the mineral estate we own at Sky Ranch. The Sky Ranch O&G Lease is now held by production, and we have been receiving royalties from the oil and gas production from six wells drilled within our mineral interest. During the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, we received $0.5 million and $0.3 million in royalties attributable to these wells.
In September 2017, we entered into a three-year Paid-Up Oil and Gas Lease with Bison Oil and Gas, LLP (Bison Lease) for the purpose of exploring for, developing, producing, and marketing oil and gas from 40 acres of mineral estate we own adjacent to the Lowry Range, and we received an up-front payment of $0.2 million. The up-front payment received pursuant to the Bison Lease was being recognized into revenue ratably over a three-year period, which expired in September 2021, and was not extended.
In July 2019, we entered into an Agreement on Locations of Oil and Gas Operations covering approximately 16 acres at Sky Ranch with the operator of the Sky Ranch O&G Lease (OGOA). The Company received an up-front payment of $0.6 million in fiscal 2019 for the OGOA, which was recognized as income on a straight-line basis over three years (the term of the OGOA). In July 2022, the operator had not spud at least one well on the oil and gas operations area. To extend its rights under the OGOA for one additional year, the oil and gas operator paid us $75,000, which is being recognized into income over the term of the extension. The operator may extend the OGOA for one additional year after that for a total of five years. As of August 31, 2022, no wells have been drilled.
Arkansas River Land and Minerals
We own approximately 700 acres of land in the Arkansas River Valley in southeastern Colorado. We currently lease all these acres for dry land grazing. We intend to sell the land in due course and have classified it as a long-term investment. We also own approximately 13,900 acres of mineral interests in the Arkansas River Valley, which has no carrying value on our books due to an impairment charge of $1.4 million we recorded in fiscal 2020. We currently have no plans to sell our mineral interests.
Significant Customers 
We primarily provide water and wastewater services on the Rangeview District’s behalf to the Rangeview District’s customers. The Rangeview District accounts for the majority of our water and wastewater service revenue. Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our significant customers. 
​
Projected Operations
​
This section should be read in conjunction with Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Along the Colorado Front Range, there are over 70 water providers with varying needs for replacement and/or new water supplies. We believe that we are well positioned to assist certain of these providers in meeting their current and future water needs.
We design, construct, and operate our water and wastewater facilities using advanced water treatment and wastewater treatment technologies, which allow us to use our water supplies in an efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. We develop our water and wastewater systems in stages to efficiently meet customer demands in our service areas by managing capital investments required for construction of facilities. We use third-party contractors to construct our facilities as needed. We employ licensed water and wastewater operators to run our water and wastewater systems. As our systems expand, we expect to hire additional personnel to operate our systems, which include water production, treatment, testing, storage, distribution, metering, billing, and operations management.
Our water and wastewater systems conjunctively use surface and groundwater supplies and storage of raw water and highly treated reclaimed water supplies to provide a balanced sustainable water supply for our customers. Integrating conservation practices and incentives, together with effective water reuse, demonstrates our commitment to providing environmentally responsible and sustainable water and wastewater services. Water supplies and water storage reservoirs are competitively sought throughout the west and along the Front Range of Colorado. We believe that regional cooperation among area water providers in developing new water supplies, water 

17



storage, and transmission and distribution systems provides the most cost-effective way of expanding and enhancing service capacities for area water providers. We continue to seek opportunities for developing water supplies and water storage opportunities with other area water providers.
As we continue expanding and developing our Rangeview Water Supply, we anticipate needing a significant number of high-capacity deep water wells. These wells would be drilled into one or more of the three principal aquifers located beneath the Lowry Range, and, as with our current wells, the water would be delivered to central water treatment facilities for treatment prior to delivery to customers. Continued development of our Lowry Range surface water supplies will require facilities to divert surface water to storage reservoirs to be located on the Lowry Range, additional treatment facilities to treat the water prior to introduction into our distribution system(s), and additional surface water diversion facilities designed with capacities to divert the surface water when available (particularly during seasonal events such as spring run-off and summer storms) for storage in reservoirs constructed on the Lowry Range. We estimate the full build-out of water and wastewater facilities (including diversion structures, transmission pipelines, reservoirs, and water treatment facilities) to develop and deliver our portfolio of water would cost in excess of $900 million, and would accommodate water service to customers located on and outside the Lowry Range. We believe this build out would occur in phases over many decades, and we believe tap fees would be sufficient to fund the required infrastructure costs.
Our Denver-based supplies are a valuable, locally available resource located near the point of use. This enables us to incrementally develop infrastructure to produce, treat and deliver water to customers based on their growing demands.
During fiscal 2022 and 2021, combined, we invested over $9.0 million in plant and facilities that interconnect the Rangeview District, WISE, and Sky Ranch water and wastewater systems to provide water and wastewater services to our growing customers at Sky Ranch and elsewhere. We expect to continue to invest in water rights and facilities as our customer demands grow.
We continue developing our Sky Ranch property, including finishing lots for home builders, building additional water and wastewater infrastructure for residential and commercial development at the property, and having homes constructed for our single-family home rental business. During the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, for Phases 1 and 2A we invested $11.5 million and $7.3 million in our Sky Ranch land which included $2.0 million and $2.5 million of expensed costs related to the delivery of finished lots and $9.5 million and $4.8 million of costs for public improvements which we expect to be repaid by the Sky Ranch CAB. Additionally, we spent approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million on construction costs related to our single-family rental business. Phase 1 was our first project as a land developer and was done ahead of our original schedule and on budget. We anticipate Phase 2A, which broke ground in February 2021, to incur a total of $20.4 million of construction costs to deliver the lots (of which we estimate $17.8 million is for public improvements which we expect to be repaid by the Sky Ranch CAB). Phase 2A is planned to be complete in the next year and has been funded by the $18.4 million of total fees paid under our lot sales agreements and will be further funded by the reimbursements from the Sky Ranch CAB of public improvements, which we estimate to be $17.8 million. During the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold 154 and 163 water and wastewater taps at Sky Ranch to homebuilders, which generated $4.5 million and $5.1 million of tap fees. As of August 31, 2022, we have sold 618 water and wastewater taps at Sky Ranch in Phases 1 and 2A. Based on current prices and engineering estimates, we believe Phase 2 of Sky Ranch will produce more than $24.0 million in water and wastewater tap fee revenue and cash over the next 3-5 years.
Our first three rental units at Sky Ranch were completed and rented in November 2021. We have begun construction on the next eleven rental units and plan to build more than 36 additional rental units over the next several years in Phases 2B-D. We anticipate building these units concurrent with construction of homes in Phase 2. We design and price rental units closer to the start of construction and currently do not have an estimate of the costs to construct or potential returns of the future rental units.
We plan to develop additional water assets within the Denver area and are exploring opportunities to utilize our water assets in areas adjacent to our existing water supplies. Additionally, we continue to source additional land acquisitions that could be paired with our water to provide additional growth to both our land development and water and wastewater segments.
Growth in Colorado
Despite the impacts of COVID-19, Colorado has continued to grow. According to the 2021 census report, Colorado added over 744,000 residents from 2010 to 2021, a growth of 14.8%, bringing the Colorado population to nearly 5.8 million, which is projected to grow to more than 8.7 million by 2050. A Statewide Water Supply Initiative report by the Colorado Water Conservation Board estimates that the South Platte River basin, which includes the Denver metropolitan region (and our Sky Ranch community), could require an additional 

18



400,000 acre-feet of water by the year 2030 due to continued growth. What makes this difficult for land developers and builders is that Colorado law requires developers to demonstrate they have sufficient water supplies for their proposed projects before zoning applications will be considered. This means developers and builders must solve their own water problems prior to development rather than wait for cities and municipalities to solve the problem. This indicates that water will continue to be critical to growth prospects for the region and the state, and that competition for available sources of water will continue to intensify.
Due to COVID-19, we have witnessed several changing consumer patterns, including residents leaving downtown urban areas to buy homes in the suburbs. This put our Sky Ranch community in the enviable position of being able to respond to this demand due to its great location, affordable home prices, available inventory, and easy access to work centers and major transportation corridors. We believe our ability to pair our water to our land and our in-house expertise for operating our systems allowed us to provide home builders with an affordable and sustainable master planned community that allowed our builders to quickly satisfy the increased demand from home buyers. We believe our affordable community will continue to grow even in the slowing housing market we are experiencing in the later months of calendar 2022.
Growth in the Denver area has trended east with significant activity occurring along the I-70 corridor, an area which enjoys excellent transportation infrastructure with I-70, rail access, and Denver International Airport (DIA). The region has significant employment centers, including DIA, the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, an Amazon fulfillment center, the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, Buckley Space Force Base, and more, creating demand for residential, retail, and commercial development opportunities.
This tremendous growth, coupled with the low new and resale inventory, along with a shift in lifestyle choices from home ownership to renting, has pushed the single-family rental market into double-digit growth. Although this market has existed for decades, the focus has shifted from individuals owning the units to commercial institutions buying large blocks of houses for rentals. The single-family rental space is now the fastest growing segment in the U.S. housing market. Demand for rental has been steadily increasing due to current demographic trends related to Gen-Y and baby boomers; however, migration patterns related to Covid-19 have accelerated that demand. According to the 2021 census, single-family rentals grew by 31% from 2007 to 2016, compared to 14% for multifamily rentals over the same period. As the demand for more single-family rental properties grows, an increasing number of larger investors are expanding their investment strategy to include the product. The single-family rental market is estimated at $3.4 trillion, compared to $3.5 trillion for the multifamily market, and institutional investors make up less than 2% of the market compared to 55% for the multifamily market. As more young families, families with children, and retirees look to rent single family homes with yards and upscale amenities on a long-term basis, more investors are looking to the single-family rental markets to expand their portfolios and grow their capital.
​
In addition to actively seeking to expand our land holdings for development purposes, we also market our water supplies and services to developers and home builders that are active along the Colorado Front Range as well as other area water providers in need of additional supplies.
​
Colorado’s future water needs will be met through conservation, reuse, and the development of new supplies. The Rangeview District’s rules and regulations for water and wastewater service call for adherence to strict conservation measures, including low-flow water fixtures, high efficiency appliances, and advanced irrigation control devices. Additionally, our systems are designed and constructed using a dual-pipe water distribution system to segregate the delivery of high-quality potable drinking water to customers through one system and a second system to supply raw or reclaimed water for irrigation demands in parks and open spaces. About one-half of the water used by a typical Denver-area residential water customer is used for outdoor landscape and lawn irrigation. We believe that raw or reclaimed water supplies provide the lowest cost, most environmentally sustainable water for outdoor irrigation. We expect our systems to include an extensive water reclamation process in which essentially all effluent water from wastewater treatment plants will be reused to meet non-potable outdoor irrigation water demands. Our dual-distribution systems demonstrate our commitment to environmentally responsible water management policies in our water-short region.
​
Labor and Raw Materials
We competitively bid contracts for infrastructure improvements (grading, utilities, roads, water, and wastewater infrastructure) at Sky Ranch. Many of our contractors enter fixed priced contracts where the contractor is at risk for cost overruns prior to completion of improvements. Under these fixed-price contracts, the contract prices are established in part based on fixed, firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates. These quotes or estimates may be based on several assumptions, including assumptions 

19



about prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other issues. Increased costs or shortages of skilled labor, concrete, steel, pipe, and other materials could cause increases in development costs and delays. These shortages and delays may result in delays in the delivery of the lots under development or the completion of water or wastewater facilities, increase costs for us or other contractors on our projects, reduce gross margins from sales, or subject us to penalties or defaults under our agreements. While we contract with third parties for our labor and materials at a fixed price, which we believe allows us the ability to mitigate the risks associated with shortages of and increases in the cost of labor and building materials, other unforeseen factors may arise which could increase our costs.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to enforce many safety measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers, business partners, and their families. While state and local mandates have been for the most part removed, we continue to encourage voluntary vaccinations and healthy practices such as hand washing, disinfecting, and social distancing when necessary. While we have transitioned back to a more traditional in office work environment, we continue to offer flexible work arrangements to employees and consultants while maintaining our efficiency with the use of video conferencing and electronic data sharing platforms. We were informed that our builder customers also took precautionary measures to ensure the safety of their employees, customers, business partners, and their families. These measures varied by builder. The most dramatic impact on our operations was and continues to be delays in the permitting process, inspections, and other activities requiring governmental agencies due to expansive work restrictions that continue to be imposed on their operations. Mainly, we experienced delays in the permitting process through the county which delayed the start of construction of Phase 2A of the Sky Ranch development. We expect COVID-19 to continue to play a role in potential delays related to the further subphases in Phase 2 at Sky Ranch due to continued changing governmental orders. 
Competition
Water and Wastewater Services
We negotiate individual service agreements with our governmental customers and with their developers and/or home builders to design, construct and operate water and wastewater systems and to provide services to end use customers of governmental entities and to commercial and industrial customers. These service agreements seek to address all aspects of the development of the water and wastewater systems, including:

(i) | the purchase of water and wastewater taps in exchange for our obligation to construct certain wholesale facilities;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the establishment of payment terms, timing, capacity, and location of special facilities (if any); and
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | specific terms related to our provision of ongoing water and wastewater services to our local governmental customers as well as the governmental entities’ end-use customers.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Although we have exclusive long-term water and wastewater service contracts for 24,000 acres of the Lowry Range, Wild Pointe, and Sky Ranch pursuant to our service agreements, providing water and wastewater service is subject to competition. Alternate sources of water are available, principally from other private parties such as farmers or others owning water rights that have historically been used for agriculture, and from municipalities seeking to annex new development areas in order to increase their tax base. Our principal competition in areas close to the Lowry Range is the City of Aurora. Principal factors affecting competition for water service include the availability of water for the particular purpose, the cost of delivering the water to the desired location (including the cost of required taps), and the reliability of the water supply during drought periods, and the political climate for additional annexations. We estimate that the water assets we own and have the exclusive right to use have a supply capacity of approximately 60,000 SFE units, and we believe that they provide us with a significant competitive advantage along the Front Range. Our legal rights to the Rangeview Water Supply have been confirmed for municipal use, and our water supply is close to Denver area water users. We believe that our pricing structure is competitive and that our water portfolio is well balanced among surface water rights, groundwater rights, storage capacity and reclaimed water supplies.
Land Development
Developing raw land is a highly competitive business, requires substantial upfront capital and typically requires many years to complete. There are many developers, as well as properties and development projects, in the same geographic area in which Sky Ranch is located. Competition among developers and projects is determined by the location of the real estate, the market appeal of the development plan, the cost and value of the end product, the developer’s ability to build, market and deliver projects on a timely and cost effective basis, and the availability of water to serve the project. Residential developers sell to home builders, who in turn compete based on location,

price/value, market segmentation, product design, and reputation. Commercial, retail, and industrial developers sell to and/or compete with other developers, owners, and operators of real estate for a limited number of potential buyers. We believe we have exceeded the market’s expectations with the delivery of our Phase 1 lots at Sky Ranch and have demonstrated the ability and expertise to continue to deliver lots in a large-scale master planned community.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
Provision of water and wastewater services is subject to regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, related state laws, and federal and state regulations issued under these laws. These laws and regulations establish criteria and standards for drinking water and for wastewater discharges. In addition, we are subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal and certain other aspects of our operations.
Environmental compliance issues may arise in the normal course of operations or because of regulatory changes. We attempt to align capital budgeting and expenditures to address these issues in a timely manner.
Safe Drinking Water Act
The Safe Drinking Water Act establishes criteria and procedures for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop national quality standards for drinking water. Regulations issued pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act and its amendments set standards on the amount of certain microbial and chemical contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water. The State of Colorado has assumed primary responsibility for enforcing the standards established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and has adopted the Colorado Primary Drinking Water Standards (Code of Colorado Regulations 5 CCR 1003-1). Current requirements for drinking water are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as we have made and are making investments to meet existing water quality standards. In the future, we might be required to change our method of treating drinking water and make additional capital investments if additional regulations become effective.
The federal Groundwater Rule became effective December 1, 2009. This rule requires additional testing of water from well sources and under certain circumstances requires demonstration and maintenance of effective disinfection. In 2009, Colorado adopted Article 13 to the Colorado Primary Drinking Water Standards to establish monitoring and compliance criteria for the Groundwater Rule. We have implemented measures to comply with the Groundwater Rule.
Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and storm water discharges into lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. The State of Colorado has assumed primary responsibility for enforcing the standards established by the federal Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from domestic water and wastewater treatment facilities and has adopted the Colorado Water Quality Control Act and related regulations, which also regulate discharges to groundwater. It is our policy to obtain and maintain all required permits and approvals for discharges from our water and wastewater facilities and to comply with all conditions of those permits and other regulatory requirements. A program is in place to monitor facilities for compliance with permitting, monitoring, and reporting for wastewater discharges. From time to time, discharge violations might occur which might result in fines and penalties, but we have no reason to believe that any such fines or penalties are pending or will be assessed.
Solid Waste Disposal
The handling and disposal of residuals and solid waste generated from water and wastewater treatment facilities is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. We have a program in place to monitor our facilities for compliance with regulatory requirements, and we do not anticipate that costs associated with our handling and disposal of waste material from our water and wastewater operations will have a material impact on our business or financial condition.
Employees and Human Capital
We currently have 35 employees, all of whom are full-time, and all are located in the USA. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Compensation and Benefits Program
​
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and shareholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as fully or partially paid health insurance (medical, dental and vision), paid time off, paid sick leave, paid parental leave, paid bereavement time, and a 401(k) plan with a company match. 
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. During 2022 we created and filled a new position that is helping to align our employees and our board members around dimensions of diversity, such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other shared attributes, which we believe help build community and enable opportunities for development. We continue to focus on building a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within Pure Cycle. We develop and encourage an inclusive culture through company events, participation in our recruitment efforts, and input into our hiring strategies.
Community Involvement
​
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer employees the opportunity to give back through volunteering or company donations to approved causes.
