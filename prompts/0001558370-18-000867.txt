 Item 1.  Business.
 (a)General Development of Business
 During October 2013, the Board of Directors of Liberty Interactive Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Liberty”) authorized a plan to distribute to the stockholders of Liberty’s Liberty Ventures common stock shares of a newly-formed company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (“TripCo” or the “Company”) (the “TripCo Spin-Off”). TripCo was formed in 2013 as a Delaware corporation. TripCo holds its subsidiary TripAdvisor, Inc. (“TripAdvisor”) and held its former subsidiary, BuySeasons, Inc. (“BuySeasons”) until BuySeasons was sold on June 30, 2017. The TripCo Spin-Off was completed on August 27, 2014 and effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of TripCo to the stockholders of Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock of Liberty. As of December 31, 2017, TripCo held an approximate 22% equity interest and 58% voting interest in TripAdvisor.
 Following the TripCo Spin-Off, Liberty and TripCo operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, TripCo entered into certain agreements, including the reorganization agreement, the services agreement, the facilities sharing agreement and the tax sharing agreement, with Liberty and/or Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) (or certain of their subsidiaries) in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the companies after the TripCo Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition.
 The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the TripCo Spin-Off, certain conditions to the TripCo Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between TripCo and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the TripCo Spin-Off.
 Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty Media provides TripCo with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. TripCo reimburses Liberty Media for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty Media in providing these services and TripCo pays a services fee to Liberty Media under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment semi-annually, as necessary. 
 Under the facilities sharing agreement, TripCo shares office space with Liberty Media and related amenities at Liberty Media’s corporate headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. 
 The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and TripCo and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, TripCo has agreed to indemnify Liberty, subject to certain limited exceptions, for losses and taxes resulting from the TripCo Spin-Off to the extent such losses or taxes result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by TripCo (applicable to actions or failures to act by TripCo and its subsidiaries following the completion of the TripCo Spin-Off).
 BuySeasons’ results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements of TripCo until June 30, 2017. BuySeasons is not presented as a discontinued operation as the sale did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on TripCo’s operations and financial results.

 (c)Narrative Description of Business
 TripAdvisor
 TripAdvisor is an online travel company and its mission is to help people around the world to plan, book and experience the perfect trip. TripAdvisor seeks to achieve its mission by providing users and travel partners a global platform about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants that includes rich user-generated content, price comparison tools and online reservation and related services.
 TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. Its flagship brand, TripAdvisor, is the world’s largest travel site based on monthly unique visitors, with 455 million average monthly unique visitors in its seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2017, according to TripAdvisor’s internal log files. 
 TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. TripAdvisor’s systems infrastructure, web and database servers for TripAdvisor branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software, and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of its software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. TripAdvisor’s systems are monitored

and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of its individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator, have their own data infrastructure and technology teams.
 TripAdvisor’s Industry and Market Opportunity
 TripAdvisor operates in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel activity and the online advertising market.
 According to Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, global travel spending is expected to be greater than $1.6 trillion in 2018. Online penetration of global travel bookings currently is estimated to be less than 50%, however, travel bookings continue to move online as consumers around the world gain access to the internet, including broadband; more users continue to access the internet via mobile devices; and global tourism activity continues to increase, driven by middle class and economic growth in some parts of the world. In addition, the internet provides greater access to travel research and booking capabilities than offline methods. Given the ongoing consumer trends around online travel media consumption and online travel commerce, TripAdvisor believes travel partners will continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels, as they seek to grow their businesses.
 Business Model
 TripAdvisor’s businesses help to match demand – users who seek to discover, research, price compare and book the best travel experiences – with supply – TripAdvisor’s travel partners who provide travel accommodations, travel experiences and travel services, worldwide.  Users
 TripAdvisor serves users through TripAdvisor’s websites and apps and focuses on content, selection, price, and convenience. TripAdvisor features approximately 600 million user-generated reviews and opinions across a broad base of global travel-related businesses, including approximately 1.2 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 750,000 vacation rentals, 4.6 million restaurants and 915,000 activities and attractions worldwide. TripAdvisor’s content – and the strong global brand it has created since its founding in 2000 – are primary drivers of not only attracting the world’s largest travel audience of 455 million unique monthly visitors but also influencing a significant amount of travel commerce. TripAdvisor is focused on creating the best online experience in travel planning and booking, making it easier for users to research destinations and experiences, to read and contribute user-generated content, compare destinations and businesses based on quality, price and availability, and to complete bookings powered by its travel partners.  Travel Partners
 TripAdvisor strives to give users more choice and to help users find the best experiences and the best deals possible and it designs its websites to enable its travel partners to be discovered, to advertise and to sell their services. TripAdvisor facilitates transactions between users and travel partners in a number of ways, including by sending referrals to its partners websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of its partners, by serving as the merchant of record – as is often the case in its attractions and vacation rentals businesses – and by offering advertising placements on TripAdvisor websites and mobile apps. Segments and Products
 TripAdvisor manages its business in two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. TripAdvisor continues to derive a significant majority of its revenue from its Hotel segment, which accounted for 77%, 80%, and 85%, of its consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Hotel segment includes revenue generated from the following sources:
· | TripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue. TripAdvisor’s largest source of Hotel segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded websites, which is primarily 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  I-4

 

comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to its travel partners’ sites. TripAdvisor’s click-based advertising travel partners are predominantly online travel agencies (“OTAs”), and direct suppliers in the hotel product category. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click (“CPC”), basis, with payments from advertisers determined by the number of users who click on a link multiplied by the price that partner is willing to pay for that click, or hotel shopper lead. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process, or metasearch auction, that enables TripAdvisor’s partners to use its proprietary, automated bidding system to submit CPC bids to have their hotel rates and availability listed on TripAdvisor’s site. Transaction revenue is generated from its instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission to TripAdvisor for a user that completes a hotel reservation via its website.

· | TripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue. Travel partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on TripAdvisor’s websites. TripAdvisor’s display-based advertising clients are predominantly direct suppliers of hotels, airlines and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. TripAdvisor also sells display-based advertising to OTAs, and other travel-related businesses, and to advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is predominantly sold on a cost per thousand impressions (“CPM”), basis. In addition, TripAdvisor offers subscription-based advertising to hotels, B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties. Subscription advertising is predominantly sold for a flat fee and enables subscribers to enhance their listing, for a contracted period of time, on TripAdvisor-branded websites, including by posting special offers for travelers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Hotel Revenue. TripAdvisor’s other hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as www.bookingbuddy.com, www.cruisecritic.com, and www.onetime.com, which includes click-based advertising revenue, display-based advertising revenue, hotel room reservations sold through the websites, and advertising revenue from making cruise reservations available for price comparison and booking. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In recent years, a significant percentage of TripAdvisor’s user traffic as well as an increasing percentage of its consolidated revenue has come from its Non-Hotel products – attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These businesses generate revenue in TripAdvisor’s Non-Hotel segment, which accounted for 23%, 20%, and 15% of TripAdvisor’s consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

· | Attractions. TripAdvisor provides information and services for users to research, book and experience activities and attractions in popular travel destinations both through Viator, TripAdvisor’s dedicated Attractions business, and on TripAdvisor’s website and applications. TripAdvisor primarily generates commissions for each transaction it facilitates through its online reservation systems. In addition to its consumer-direct business, Viator also powers activity and attractions booking capabilities for its affiliate partners, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains and online and offline travel agencies. TripAdvisor enables users to book approximately 83,000 activities and attractions, via third-party suppliers, which are available on Viator-branded websites and mobile applications and on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Restaurants. TripAdvisor provides information and services for users to research and book restaurants in popular travel destinations through its dedicated restaurant reservations business, TheFork, and on TripAdvisor websites and applications. TheFork is an online restaurant booking platform operating on a number of websites (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl, and www.dimmi.com.au), with a network of restaurant partners located primarily across Europe and Australia. TripAdvisor generates reservation revenue that is paid by restaurants for diners seated through TheFork’s online reservation systems, and generates subscription fees for TripAdvisor’s online booking and marketing analytics tools provided by TheFork and by TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor enables users to book approximately 46,000 restaurants, which are available on www.thefork.com and on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.

· | Vacation Rentals. TripAdvisor provides information and services for users to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full home rentals, condominiums, villas, beach rentals, cabins and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cottages. The Vacation Rentals business generates revenue primarily by offering individual property owners and property managers, the ability to list their properties on TripAdvisor’s websites and mobile applications thereby connecting homeowners with travelers through a free-to-list, commission-based option, and, to a lesser extent, by an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, and www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Commercial Relationships
 TripAdvisor has a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of its business.  Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, TripAdvisor works hard to ensure the mutual success of these relationships. 
 TripAdvisor has commercial relationships with the majority of the world’s leading OTAs, as well as a variety of other travel partners pursuant to which these companies primarily purchase traveler leads from TripAdvisor, generally on a click-based advertising basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, TripAdvisor’s two most significant travel partners were Expedia Inc. (“Expedia”) and The Priceline Group Inc. (“Priceline”), including certain of their respective brands. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Expedia and Priceline, each accounted for more than 10% of TripAdvisor’s consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately 43%, 46% and 46%, respectively, of its consolidated revenue. Nearly all of this concentration of revenue is recorded in TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment for these reporting periods. 
 Intellectual Property
 TripAdvisor’s intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of its business. TripAdvisor relies on its intellectual property rights in its content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content. TripAdvisor has acquired some of its intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties and these agreements may place restrictions on its use of the intellectual property.
 TripAdvisor protects its intellectual property by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. TripAdvisor protects its brands by pursuing the trademark registration of its core brands, as appropriate, maintaining its trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. TripAdvisor also registers copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, TripAdvisor protects its trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program.
 TripAdvisor has considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant.  However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by TripAdvisor.
 Seasonality
 Traveler expenditures in the global travel market tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, expenditures by travel partners/advertisers to market to potential travelers and, thereby, TripAdvisor’s financial performance, or revenue and profits, tend to be seasonal as well. As a result, TripAdvisor’s financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a year, as it is a key period for leisure travel research and trip-taking, which includes the seasonal peak in traveler hotel and vacation rental stays, and tours and attractions taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters which represent seasonal low points. Further significant shifts in TripAdvisor’s business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.

 Terms of Investment in TripAdvisor
 We own an approximate 22% equity interest and 58% voting interest in TripAdvisor as of December 31, 2017. TripAdvisor’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of TripAdvisor common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect a number of directors equal to 25% of the total number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is currently three directors. We consolidate TripAdvisor as we control a majority of the voting interest in TripAdvisor. We are subject to a Governance Agreement with TripAdvisor which provides us with certain director nomination, registration and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on our shares of Class B common stock. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 TripAdvisor is subject to a number of United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm TripAdvisor’s business. These include laws and regulations regarding user privacy, libel, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, taxation, online payment services, competition and protection of minors. In particular, TripAdvisor is subject to United States federal and state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which TripAdvisor operates. 
 TripAdvisor provides advertising data and information and conducts marketing activities that are subject to United States federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally. The United States and European Union have begun to adopt legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including, among other things, online editorial and user-generated content, data privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. 
 It is impossible to accurately predict whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on TripAdvisor’s services, and whether or how TripAdvisor might be affected. Increased regulation of the internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect TripAdvisor’s business, financial condition or operational results. 
 TripAdvisor is subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. In TripAdvisor’s processing of reservations, it receives and stores a large volume of personally identifiable data in the United States, Europe and Asia. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the European Union through its enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The enactment, interpretation and application of these laws is in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. 
 Competition
 TripAdvisor competes in rapidly evolving and competitive markets. TripAdvisor faces competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services, also known in the industry as hotel metasearch, and online reservations. In the competition to attract users to its platform, TripAdvisor relies on its ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as online search, email and television.  These marketing strategies can be impacted by competitive site content, changes to TripAdvisor’s website architecture and page designs, changes to search engine ranking algorithms, updates in competitor advertising strategies, or changes to display ordering in search engine results such as preferred placement for internal products offered by search engines.
 TripAdvisor competes with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies it participates in, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:

 
  I-7

 


· | In TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment, it both partners with and faces competition from OTAs (including Expedia and Priceline and many of their respective subsidiaries and operating companies); hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, a subsidiary of Expedia, Kayak, a subsidiary of Priceline, HotelsCombined and Ctrip.com International, Ltd.); large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies (including Google, Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba and Amazon); traditional offline travel agencies; and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In TripAdvisor’s Non-Hotel segment, TripAdvisor’s Attractions business competes with both traditional and online travel agencies, online travel service providers, wholesalers, and individual tour operators. TripAdvisor’s Restaurants business competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Yelp and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline), and local or regional providers. TripAdvisor’s Vacation Rentals business competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations, including Airbnb and HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and booking.com (a subsidiary of Priceline). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As the industry continues to shift towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, TripAdvisor anticipates that the existing competitive landscape will continue to change, new competitors may emerge, and industry consolidation may continue. 
 Employees
 TripCo currently does not have any corporate employees. Liberty Media provides TripCo with certain management services pursuant to a services agreement and certain of Liberty Media’s corporate employees and executive officers will provide services to TripCo for a determined fee. As of December 31, 2017, TripAdvisor had approximately 3,228 employees. Of those employees, approximately 51% were based in the United States. TripAdvisor believes it has good relationships with its employees, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations.
