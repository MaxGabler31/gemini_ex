Item 1. Business 
General
Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) is an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas, focused on U.S. unconventional resource plays with operations in the United States, Europe and Africa. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. The two segments are:

• | United States E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States;


• | International E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

We were incorporated in 2001. 
Our strategy is to deliver competitive returns by focusing on the lowest cost, highest margin U.S. resource plays while maintaining a peer-leading balance sheet. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.
We are concentrated on our core operations in our U.S. unconventional resource plays and E.G. The map below shows the locations of our core operations:
* Our additional locations include the Gulf of Mexico, U.K., Libya, Gabon and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.
Segment and Geographic Information
In the second quarter of 2017, we closed on the sale of our Canadian business which includes our Oil Sands Mining segment and exploration stage in-situ leases. The Canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Additionally, we have renamed our North America E&P segment to United States E&P segment, effective June 30, 2017. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. For reportable operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
In the following discussion regarding our United States E&P and International E&P segments, references to sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.

United States E&P Segment
We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S. Our primary focus in the United States E&P segment is concentrated within our four high quality unconventional resource plays. See Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further detail on current year results.
United States E&P-- Unconventional Resource Plays 
Eagle Ford – We have been operating in the South Texas Eagle Ford play since 2011, where roughly two thirds of our acreage is located in Karnes County and Atascosa County. We operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the field that support more than 1,500 producing wells. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa and Bee Counties. 
Bakken – We have been operating in North Dakota and eastern Montana since 2006. The majority of our acreage is in core prospects within McKenzie, Mountrail, and Dunn Counties in North Dakota. We continue focusing on the high-return Myrmidon area building on the successes from our enhanced completion designs, as well as delineating our position in Hector. 
Oklahoma – Our primary focus in Oklahoma has been delineation and leasehold protection in the Meramec play in the STACK and delineation of the Woodford and Springer plays in the SCOOP, as we move toward infill development. We hold net acreage with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage, Oswego, Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays, with a majority of this in the SCOOP and STACK. 
Northern Delaware – We closed on multiple Permian acquisitions during 2017, with a majority of the acreage in Northern Delaware. These acquisitions give us a strong foundational footprint in the region where we have begun developing the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. 
Other United States 
Our remaining properties in the United States primarily consist of outside operated assets in the Gulf of Mexico, including the Gunflint field where we hold an 18% non-operated working interest. 
International E&P Segment 
We are engaged in oil and gas development and production across our international locations primarily in E.G., U.K. and Libya. We include the results of our LPG processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&P segment. 
International E&P
Equatorial Guinea – We own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the Alba field and an 80% operated working interest in Block D, both of which are offshore E.G. Block D was unitized with the Alba field in second quarter 2017. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 99% in 2017. 
Equatorial Guinea – Gas Processing – We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the LPG plant. The LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. 
We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. The LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. Under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled approximately 3.95 mmta in 2017. AMPCO had gross sales totaling approximately 1,100 mt in 2017. Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S. 
United Kingdom – Our operated asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields, a 39% working interest in the East Brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby Braemar field. We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. 
6

Libya – We hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which includes acreage located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya. While civil and political unrest has interrupted operations in recent years, our production resumed in October 2016 at our Waha concession. During December 2016, liftings resumed from the Es Sider crude oil terminal. During 2017 sales volumes and production continued, except for a brief interruption in March 2017 due to civil unrest. 
Other International 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq – We have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with a 15% working interest and Sarsang with a 20% working interest. In 2016, we relinquished to the Kurdistan Regional Government our 45% operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil.  
Gabon – We hold a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the Tchicuate block where we have an exploration and production sharing agreement.
In the third quarter 2017, we entered into separate agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our International E&P segment, and a portion of this transaction closed during the 4th quarter 2017. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.
Reserves
Proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Approximately 72% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries, with 70% located within the U.S.

Acreage
We believe we have satisfactory title to our United States E&P and International E&P properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.
The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our United States E&P and International E&P segments as of December 31, 2017. 

 | Developed | Undeveloped | | Developed andUndeveloped

In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses or concessions, additional undeveloped acreage will expire in future years. We plan to continue the terms of certain of these licenses and concession areas or retain leases through operational or administrative actions.

Marketing 
Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.
Gross Delivery Commitments
We have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2017, the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following commitments:

 | 2018 | 2019 | | 2020 | Thereafter | Commitment Period Through
Eagle Ford | | | | | | 
Crude and condensate (mbbld) | 95 | | 65 | | 51 | | — | 2020

Oklahoma | | | | | | 
Natural gas (mmcfd) | — | | 90 | | 118 | | 110 - 148 | 2030

All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. In addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.

Competition 
Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies. We compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. 
Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. 
New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.
For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.
Air and Climate Change
Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.
Government entities have filed lawsuits in California and New York seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in six of these lawsuits in California, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. 
The EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone in October 2015. This more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. The EPA anticipates promulgating final area designations under the new standard in the first half of 2018. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of 
12

that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule.
In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements.  BLM issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017 and has indicated that the requirements could be rescinded or significantly revised in the future. If not withdrawn or significantly revised, this rule is expected to result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.  If we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. These regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. 
Water
In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the Clean Water Act ("CWA") and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. If this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.
For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2017, sales to Vitol and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. In 2016, sales to Valero Marketing and Supply, Tesoro Petroleum, and Flint Hills Resources and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of our total revenues. In 2015, sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. 
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.
Employees
We had approximately 2,300 active, full-time employees as of December 31, 2017.
