ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview 
Aerohive Networks, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Aerohive Networks,” “Aerohive,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), has designed and developed a leading cloud networking platform and product portfolio using cloud management, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to simplify and secure the access network. Our cloud-managed wireless, switching, routing, and security technologies provide flexibility and scalability in the deployment, management and licensing of networks globally. Our global cloud footprint provides network operations for 30,000+ customers and 10+ million daily users.
Technologies and Solutions
We are building a portfolio of products and solutions around four primary sets of technologies and capabilities:

• | Enterprise Cloud Networking. Using cloud-based technologies, whether as a public or private cloud, to reduce the complexity of deploying and managing Wi-Fi access points, access switches, SD-WAN-capable routers and cloud-managed NAC solution; 


• | Wi-Fi as the Primary Connectivity. Putting more Wi-Fi intelligence and power closer to the end user using a distributed-control architecture that greatly simplifies network topologies and IT operations; 


• | Cloud-Managed Network Access Control (NAC). Securing, controlling and managing network-connected devices, including wireless and wired, IoT and BYOD, with our vendor-agnostic, cloud-managed NAC solution to reduce complexity and cost compared to traditional on-premises offerings; and 


• | Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Applying machine learning to collected data sets to increase accuracy and actions to be driven by artificial intelligence to improve the operation of a customer's network. 

We believe that each of these areas for innovation adds valuable customer capabilities, differentiates our offering, and showcases our continuing innovation.
Enterprise Cloud Networking. Our customers today are increasingly demanding ease and simplicity in how they deploy, manage, license, and operate their access networks with a particular emphasis on the Wi-Fi and security elements. Cloud networking positions us to deliver this to organizations of all sizes. Our cloud capabilities, including our HiveManager network management applications and A3 cloud-managed NAC, combined with machine learning and emerging developments in artificial intelligence technology, can provide the feature depth required for managing enterprise-class networks. We believe we are the only major vendor who can provide these enterprise-class capabilities in public cloud, private cloud and on on-premise deployments.
We have chosen to focus on enterprise cloud management based on compelling benefits we believe we can offer our customers. Legacy approaches to network management have relied on complex enterprise applications that customers must install, integrate, maintain, and administer. New releases were infrequent, and updates installed by customers even less frequent. In contrast, our cloud-based network management provides a single, integrated management view across the entire network that a customer can access from virtually anywhere. We maintain and administer the network management application in the cloud, which users then access as a subscription service that can be regularly updated in response to new features or urgent changes. 
With our innovations in cloud management, we believe we can deliver a number of important capabilities to our customers. While enterprise customers want simplified network management, they still need a full set of features and capabilities. Our “progressive disclosure” user interface means that advanced features are available but are hidden from view when not being used. Similarly, organizations that need to deploy the network often do not have technical staff at every location. Our cloud management supports automated provisioning, where a device that is connected to the network for the first time can automatically find and download its proper configuration. Our cloud management solution also includes troubleshooting capabilities, such as dashboards, to identify potential issues, and monitoring, to research and resolve them. Finally, cloud management makes it possible for a customer to evaluate the capabilities of our solution. A single wireless access point with a corresponding license for HiveManager gives customers access to such capabilities. In addition, those customers who want the capabilities of cloud management, but also need to manage their network in their own datacenter, behind their own firewall, can install and run HiveManager "on premises" at a customer location with similar functionality and software as we offer in the public cloud. Overall, by taking advantage of our innovative capabilities, our customers are able to manage even large networks with a small staff and limited resources.

While we were an early leader in controllerless Wi-Fi and cloud management, we continue to innovate and to invest in HiveManager as our strategic cloud management application. We are focusing our current efforts on HiveManager (an updated version of our legacy HiveManager application, we now call HiveManager Classic). HiveManager features an updated user interface, improved troubleshooting, expanded access to data and analytics, and an upgraded cloud-deployment platform. HiveManager also offers a more dynamic platform for innovation. Throughout 2016, we delivered new releases of HiveManager that continued to expand our enterprise feature set and improve the user experience. In January 2017, we announced HiveManager Connect, a simplified version of HiveManager included as a part of our new Aerohive Connect product line designed for customers with less complex, connectivity-oriented requirements. Aerohive's Connect customers can purchase a subscription to upgrade to our current full-featured Aerohive Select offering to access additional capabilities, such as advanced security and troubleshooting tools, support for BYOD programs, increased network visibility, enterprise support options, and the ability to deploy HiveManager on-premises or in a private cloud environment. In 2018, we added machine-learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to our HiveManager application, such as: Client 360, to improve the client experience; Network 360, to improve the health and performance of the network; and an Amazon Alexa Skill called HiveManager Shortcuts, to provide network administrators with a voice-driven, Al-powered interface to provide hands-free network monitoring and performance analytics on-the-go using simple voice commands.
Throughout 2018, we have seen significant increase in the rate of migration from HiveManager Classic to HiveManager by existing customers, and HiveManager has become the primary choice for new customers. However, we will continue to offer and support both versions of the application, while working with current HiveManager Classic customers as appropriate to migrate to HiveManager. 
Wi-Fi as the Primary Connectivity for the Enterprise. We have built our Wi-Fi around a distributed-control and data-plane architecture that simplifies deployment, management, and operation while providing resiliency. We believe our distributed-control and data-plane technology remains one of our key innovations and differentiators. Over the last decade, Wi-Fi architectures have gone through a series of evolutions in response to changing technologies and user requirements. When the original autonomous Wi-Fi access points proved difficult to manage vendors introduced wireless LAN controllers to the network. Wireless LAN controllers brought management and control, but they also brought the cost and complexity of dedicated hardware, a new single point of failure, and rigid deployments less able to meet dynamic requirements of wireless networks. To overcome these limitations other vendors have integrated their controller with switches or Wi-Fi access points, or moved their controllers into the cloud, with greater cost and limited capabilities. In contrast, our architecture distributes the control plane across the Wi-Fi access points, eliminating the need for any wireless LAN controller and reducing costs of operation. We deliver distributed control through HiveOS, our device-operating system that runs on every Aerohive Wi-Fi access point. HiveOS delivers radio management, client roaming, load balancing, policy enforcement, packet inspection and other functions locally on the Wi-Fi access point. 
Our distributed-control and data-plane architecture provides several benefits to our customers. Most important is the scalability of a single architecture. Most of our competitors have different technologies and products for different sizes of deployments. Instead, our customers can start small and grow as they need to without change in architecture or Wi-Fi technology. Our customers can also mix different generations of Wi-Fi access points in the same network; thus, preserving existing infrastructure investments. Overall, by intelligently distributing control over the Wi-Fi access points our architecture can support faster deployments and greater resiliency.
Integral to our scalable Wi-Fi is the ability to enforce security at the Wi-Fi access point based on the end customer’s access policies, which can be based on the application being used, or other factors such as the device user identity and role, device type and ownership, and network access location and time of day. Our Private Pre-Shared Key ("PPSK") technology extends these capabilities to assign each device a unique key for accessing the network that can be authorized or revoked without impacting other network devices. PPSK can also be used in Internet of Things ("IoT") deployments to authorize devices that do not have a keyboard or some other mechanism for providing credentials.
While we emphasize our Wi-Fi capabilities our portfolio also includes cloud-managed access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers. Our Wi-Fi access points do not require either our access switches or SD-WAN-capable routers: they can be used with products from other major network hardware manufacturers. However, customers who purchase our access switches or SD-WAN-capable routers gain the ability to manage them with their wireless access points through a single HiveManager interface. 
Cloud-Managed NAC. Access networks present multiple IT security challenges due to an ever-growing number of corporate and guest devices, as well as IoT and Bring-Your-Own-Device ("BYOD"), needing to be securely on-boarded and provisioned with the access rights appropriate for their roles. Once authenticated, the devices accessing the network can continue to pose security risks due to malware and compromised third-party applications the devices may accumulate over time.

A3, our cloud-managed NAC solution we introduced in 2018, provides security for all devices on the network. It delivers enterprise-grade functionality for device onboarding, visibility, profiling and policy enforcement, while its cloud-management option offers deployment simplicity, flexibility and scalability. Streamlined user-interface ("UI")-based workflows can further reduce the operational complexity and cost typically associated with competing offerings. A3 can orchestrate complementary security solutions, leveraging them to extend and unify policy enforcement to further bolster overall network security. A3 is vendor agnostic, with functionality supported on all major vendor networks. When deployed on an Aerohive network it delivers benefits like single-pane-of-glass management from Aerohive's HiveManager and PPSK. 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Increasingly, our customers are looking for value from the data their networks generate. Aerohive's access networks can be instrumented to collect and process enormous amounts of data using machine learning and emerging developments in artificial intelligence technology, focusing on characterizing client experience, application usage, and infrastructure device effectiveness. We believe such machine-learning-derived results, coupled with the ability to utilize artificial-intelligence-driven actions, can address a variety of use cases, including:    

• | Component Benchmarking and Health. Tracking and comparing utilization of a customer's network components to other access networks of a similar size and domain; 


• | Client Benchmarking and Health. Tracking and comparing client experience in a customer's access network to other access networks of a similar size and domain; and 


• | Presence and Location. Tracking, correlating and reporting the proximity (Bluetooth-derived), presence (Wi-Fi-derived) and/or location (Wi-Fi-derived) of user and devices in near-real-time or over time. 

Application developers are also able to take advantage of the Aerohive Cloud Services ("ACS") platform. The ACS platform collects data for our customers from Aerohive network devices and, we expect in the future, from other vendor devices or third-party sources. We are also developing the ability to collect and aggregate data for our customers into a secure and scalable cloud-based store, which then can be processed and made available to our customers externally via APIs. Application developers can incorporate these APIs into their applications in order to receive data and analytics from us without needing to collect and process this data themselves. This approach means that the ACS platform has the extensibility to support additional use cases in the future. We expect to continue to expand the APIs and analytics that we make available from the ACS platform in order to encourage and enable an open-application-development environment to make possible compelling applications for our partners and customers. 
Products
We offer our solution to end customers as a portfolio of products that includes our hardware products, cloud-based network management and applications, and support services.
Our hardware products include Wi-Fi access points, access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers. Our hardware design team develops our hardware products by working in conjunction with original design manufacturers ("ODMs"). Our Wi-Fi access points and SD-WAN branch routers run our proprietary HiveOS operating system. We generally sell our access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers in conjunction with a sale of Wi-Fi access points. We also sell our Wi-Fi access points for use with other manufactures' access switches and routers.
Our cloud-based product offering includes HiveManager, our next-generation network management application which features an updated user interface, improved troubleshooting, expanded access to data and analytics and an upgraded cloud-deployment platform. 
We offer tiered maintenance and support services under renewable, fee-based maintenance and support contracts, which include technical support, bug fixes, access to priority hardware replacement services and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Our Software as a Service ("SaaS") subscriptions include comparable maintenance and support services.
We continue to look for new ways to package and deliver our product to address customer demand and market opportunity. In January 2017, we introduced our Aerohive Connect product line targeting customers with simpler connectivity-oriented use cases. All Aerohive access points and switches can be purchased and deployed with Aerohive's subscription-free Connect offering, which is a simplified version of HiveManager, and community/email-based customer support. We offer Aerohive Connect as a complement to, not a replacement for, our full offering which we refer to as Aerohive Select. Aerohive Select remains our flagship solution capable of addressing the most-demanding enterprise network, deployment, and security requirements. Aerohive Connect customers can easily upgrade to Select at any time with the purchase of an entitlement key that provides access to additional feature sets and support. We expect many customers who might otherwise not initially consider Aerohive to be nonetheless attracted to the simplicity and low cost of Aerohive Connect and the ability to transition later to Aerohive Select as their network requirements evolve.

In April 2018, we introduced the Aerohive Atom AP30, the first enterprise-class pluggable access point designed to augment or replace ceiling-mounted access points and to simplify providing connectivity in both easy and hard-to-reach locations with the ability to quickly fill in Wi-Fi dead zones, improve meeting space capacity and network validation, and reduce the need for wiring.
In July 2018, we shipped the first family of enterprise-class access points, the AP630, AP650 and AP650X, based on the developing 802.11ax standard (also known as Wi-Fi 6). These newest-generation access points are designed for high density and performance environments, combining IEEE's 802.11ax technology with our HiveManager network management system, machine learning, and artificial intelligence capabilities. In addition, the integrated BLE radio and a USB interface in these access points open a multitude of deployment use-cases in IoT and proximity/location-oriented services. 
In September 2018, we introduced the XR600P, our highest capacity SD-WAN branch router, capable of operating as both VPN client and server, which offers larger branches increased throughput, secure application-aware traffic shaping and monitoring, end-to-end QoS, and dynamic link prioritization. Managed by HiveManager, Aerohive's industry-leading cloud-management platform, Aerohive's XR routers can be deployed with ease and at scale alongside Aerohive's unified switches and access points for a full-stack distributed access network solution.
Segment and Geographic Information
We operate one reporting segment and operating segment structure. We present financial information about our operating segment and geographic areas in Note 10 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Customers
We sell our products to end customers through a network of authorized distributors, value-added resellers ("VARs") and managed-service providers ("MSPs"). We have sold our products to tens of thousands of end customers worldwide. We define end customers as organizations holding or having held licenses to our products and software subscription and services. Our end customers represent a broad range of industry verticals, including education, distributed enterprises, retail, hospitality and healthcare. In many cases, our target customers are installing a Wi-Fi network for the first time, or in parts of their organization that do not currently have Wi-Fi installed. In other cases, our customers already have a Wi-Fi network installed and our opportunity is to engage them in a future expansion or replacement of their current solution.
Sales
We use channel partners to sell and deliver our solutions to our end customers, which we support through our sales organization. Our sales teams are located in the United States, Asia Pacific and in Europe and focus on the development and enablement of our channels, the acquisition of end customer accounts in both the enterprise and State & Local Government/Education segments and overall market development. Our sales engineers have responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end customers, and technical training for our channel partners. We continue to evaluate and adjust our sales headcount in our principal and emerging markets based on a combination of our current sales results and future sales potential. 
Our sales team works with our channel partners who have networking, Wi-Fi, security and/or vertical market expertise to win and support end customers through a direct-touch approach. Our distributors sell our products to and support our VARs, who then sell our products directly to end customers, often with the addition of their own installation or professional services. We are increasingly working with MSPs, who bundle our product and service offerings with their own infrastructure and services to provide ongoing network operations and management to end customers. This includes traditional VARs who are now expanding their services offering to include ongoing network management services. 
We extend our sales capabilities through strategic alliances with companies such as Dell EMC and Juniper Networks. We hope to develop such alliances to be meaningful contributions to our business going forward. 
Backlog 
We typically accept and ship orders for product and related services within a short time-frame. However, our partners may reschedule orders without penalty, or we may delay shipment due to inventory constraints. As such, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.

Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. To this end, we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in various fields, including networking platforms, cloud operations and applications, security systems, RF functions, user-interface design and open-source programming. We currently conduct our research and development efforts in California, with an additional facility in China. 
We have invested significant time and financial resources in the development of our products, including our cloud services platform, HiveManager, and operating platform, HiveOS. We view continued investment in these capabilities as essential to our ability to differentiate ourselves in a competitive industry and to continue to be able to grow our business. For example, in 2015 we released HiveManager, our next-generation cloud services platform which provides a basis for data services and data analytic applications, and we released additional software modules to enhance the functionality and performance of our HiveOS operating system. In 2015, we announced our ACS platform, which provides a secure and scalable cloud-based big data store for data collected from Aerohive network devices, other devices, or third-party sources, which can then be available to application developers to incorporate their API applications without needing to collect and process this data themselves. In April 2016, we announced with our partner Dell EMC, a Dell-branded version of HiveManager capable of managing Dell N-series switches in the same network as Aerohive Wi-Fi access points, delivering multi-vendor integrated wired and wireless network management. Throughout 2016, we delivered new releases of HiveManager that continued to expand our enterprise feature set and improve the user experience. In January 2017, we announced HiveManager Connect, a simplified version of HiveManager included as a part of our new Aerohive Connect product line designed for customers with less complex, connectivity-oriented requirements. Aerohive's Connect customers can purchase a perpetual license or subscription to upgrade to our current full-featured Aerohive Select offering to access additional capabilities, such as advanced security and troubleshooting tools, support for BYOD programs, increased network visibility, enterprise support options, and the ability to deploy HiveManager on-premises or in a private cloud environment. The capabilities of our scalable cloud platform enabled all of these innovations.
Later in 2017 we also announced our SD-WAN solution for highly distributed commercial enterprises, retail chains, and long-term healthcare providers which, when combined with our existing SD-LAN offering, enables organizations to simplify branch deployments with a unified cloud-management Wi-Fi, switching, and SD-WAN VPN routing solution. In 2018, we announced our A3 cloud-managed NAC solution, Aerohive Atom AP30 pluggable access point, XR600P SD-WAN branch router, as well as our family of enterprise-class access points based on the developing 802.11ax standard.
We plan to continue to expand our product offerings and solutions capabilities in the future and to dedicate significant resources to these research and development efforts.
Manufacturing 
We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to ODMs currently located in China and Taiwan. We believe that using original design manufacturers helps to optimize our operations by lowering costs, reducing time-to-market and enabling us to adjust to changing end customer demand.
Our ODM partners ship finished products to our warehousing and delivery logistics centers in the U.S., the Netherlands, Malaysia and China. We operate these logistic centers for all end customer shipments, whether destined to locations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), or Asia Pacific and Japan ("APAC"). 
Our manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates at the time of future demand for our products, based upon historical trends and the assessment of our sales and product management functions of end customer demand and overall market conditions. 
Our ODMs source the component parts within our products. We do not contract directly and do not have any long-term manufacturing contracts that guarantee us any fixed access to such component parts or specific pricing. This absence of direct and long-term component supply contracts may increase our exposure to shortages of component availability and to price increases which the ODM or supplier may charge in response to increased product demand or fluctuations related to the raw material inputs for such components. In addition, during periods of continued fluctuating or flat customer demand for our products our ODMs may be required to slow the production rate for those products, thus increasing costs, extending time-to-market and otherwise creating uncertainty for our ODM relationships. 
Competition 
We operate in a competitive market for enterprise mobility and network-edge infrastructure, which continues to experience constant change and consolidation. Our competitors include general networking and independent Wi-Fi vendors, such as Cisco/Meraki, Hewlett-Packard/Aruba, Arris/Ruckus, Ubiquiti, Extreme Networks, Huawei and Riverbed/Xirrus whose portfolios include enterprise mobility solutions and wireless access products.
5

Trends in enterprise network infrastructures and mobility are all significantly increasing the importance of access networks and Wi-Fi to our target customers. As organizations address the proliferation of mobile devices, increased BYOD utilization, enterprise adoption of cloud and the adoption of mobile-first applications they compare competing access network and wireless infrastructure products based on:

• | ability to address specific customer-use cases;


• | ease-of-use and simplicity of solutions;


• | price and total cost of ownership;


• | flexibility and feature-depth of solutions;


• | ability to meet deployment requirements;


• | ability to support business or customer-facing applications;


• | performance and scalability of products;


• | network survivability and reliability of solutions;


• | security of the network; and


• | for service providers, ability to support business/operating models.

We believe that we generally compete favorably on the combined basis of all of these factors. However, some of our competitors have better solutions for one or several of these factors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end customers, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios which provide a greater ability to assemble, market, aggressively price and more quickly bring to market different capabilities across integrated product platforms. Other competitors are also working to grow their cloud-networking capabilities, an area that has been one of our key differentiators. 
Seasonality 
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information regarding seasonality of our business.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2018, we had 75 issued patents and 48 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our current and next-generation networking products, operating platform and cloud-based applications, and the ability to claim priority to most of the patent applications worldwide. Our patents issued in the U.S. will expire between 2028 and 2036. However, these patents or any patents that may issue to us in the future may be subject to re-examination, contest, circumvention, or found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may or may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open-source software. We believe our licenses are on commercially reasonable terms.
We utilize internal and external controls to restrict access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end customers and channel partners. Our software is also protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. However, despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, and reasonable security measures, third parties may still copy our products or otherwise gain access to or obtain and use our proprietary software and technology without our knowledge or authority or in ways we do not intend. 
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, and competitors increasingly may utilize litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights to protect or expand their market position. In particular, leading and more mature companies in the wireless networking industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. As end customers increasingly use our products and services, and to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties, not only from our competitors but also increasingly from non-operating entities, who will be more likely to claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights. From time-to-time, such third parties, including certain of these leading companies and, increasingly, non-operating entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end customers. In these instances, our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our channel partners and end customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing 
6

certain services, require us to expend significant management attention and money to develop non-infringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. This could include treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. We currently do not maintain insurance coverage against any such claims. 
In addition, our products utilize software modules under third-party open-source licenses, including as incorporated into software we receive from third-party commercial software vendors. Some open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open-source software that we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to release portions of the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.
We cannot assure that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, or that we can resolve through litigation or on reasonable settlement terms, any such claims against us relating to, any third-party patents or other proprietary rights, including relating to use of third-party open source software. See “Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings” and “Part I, Item 1A - Risk Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 460 employees in offices in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. None of our employees is represented by labor unions, whether in the United States or abroad. We consider all current employee relations to be good. However, we continue to see employee turn-over, particularly amongst our employees in Silicon Valley where competition is typically high for sales and engineering personnel.
