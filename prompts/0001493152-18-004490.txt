Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an Oregon-based producer and marketer of craft spirits, founded in 2008. Our products span several alcoholic beverage categories, including bourbon, American whiskey, vodka, gin and rum. Unlike other distillers, we operate several retail tasting rooms in Oregon to market our brands directly to consumers. Our strategy for growth is to build on our local base in the Pacific Northwest and expand selectively to other markets, using major spirits distributors. In December 2016, we retained Sandstrom Partners, an internationally-known spirit branding firm that branded St-Germain and Bulleit Bourbon, to guide our marketing strategy and branding. Sandstrom Partners subsequently became an investor in our company. With the assistance of Sandstrom Partners and using our in-house spirits expertise, during 2017, we created Redneck Riviera Whiskey (“RRW”), in collaboration with Country Music superstar John Rich, of the duo “Big & Rich.” Supported by John Rich’s marketing efforts, we launched RRW in the Southeastern and Gulf States primarily through Republic National Distributing Company (“RNDC”). We believe that RRW will achieve commercial success on a broad scale, and we have therefore focused our sales efforts outside Oregon on RRW. We believe RRW will be a key growth engine in 2018 and will also provide a “coattail” effect for our other brands, helping them to achieve improved national recognition and success.
 
Operating as a small business in a large, international spirits marketplace occupied by massive conglomerates, we seek to turn our small size from a disadvantage into an advantage. As the success of our RRW launch and Sandstrom Partners collaboration demonstrate, our team can leverage its smaller size to launch new brands more quickly than larger conglomerates because we are able to dedicate more of our attention and resources to developing innovative products. We believe that the dominance of Canadian whiskeys in the light-whiskey segment is vulnerable to a light whiskey that is 100% American, and we are exploiting that vulnerability with RRW, a product that went from idea, to celebrity collaboration, to design and formulation, to market roll-out in less than nine months. We are innovative in targeting emerging trends with our products; for example, we recently developed our Coffee Rum with cold brew coffee and low sugar, as well as our gluten-free potato vodka. We seek to be both a leader in creating spirits that offer better value than comparable spirits (for example, our value-priced Portland Potato Vodka), and an innovator in creating imaginative spirits that offer a unique taste experience, like our Coffee Rum, Oregon oak-aged whiskeys and Marionberry Whiskey.
 
As a Nasdaq-traded company, we have access to public capital markets to support our growth initiatives, including strategic acquisitions. In May 2017, we used our shares to acquire 90% of Big Bottom Distillery (“BBD”), known for its award-winning, super-premium gins and whiskeys, including The Ninety One Gin, Navy Strength Gin, Oregon Gin, Delta Rye and American Single Malt Whiskey. BBD’s super-premium spirits give us a presence at the “high end” of the market. In addition, through MotherLode Craft Distillery (“MotherLode”), our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired in March 2017, we also provide contract bottling and packaging services for existing and emerging spirits producers, some of whom contract with us to blend or distill spirits. During 2018, we intend to use our “slim line” canning equipment, newly installed at MotherLode, to profit from an emerging consumer interest in canned wine. We believe our location close to vineyards in Oregon and Washington is a competitive advantage.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada in February 2004 under the name Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. In December 2014, we changed our corporate name to Eastside Distilling, Inc. to reflect our then recent acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC.
The Acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC
 
In October 2014, Eurocan Holdings Ltd. consummated the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Eastside Distilling, LLC (“Eastside”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Eurocan, Eastside and Eastside Distilling, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Eastside merged with and into Eastside Distilling, Inc. The merger consideration for the Acquisition consisted of 1,600,000 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock. In addition, certain of our stockholders cancelled an aggregate of 1,245,500 shares of our common stock held by them. As a result, upon consummation of the Merger Agreement on October 31, 2014, we had 2,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, of which 1,600,000 shares were held by the former members of Eastside.
 
Following the Acquisition, we conduct the business of Eastside as our primary business.

Market Opportunity
 
Large and Growing Global and Domestic Markets
 
The global spirits market generated total revenues of $316 billion in 2013, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% between 2009 and 2013, according to MarketLine. The performance of the market is forecasted to accelerate with an anticipated CAGR of 4.2% for the five-year period 2013-2018, which is expected to increase revenues generated by this market to a value of approximately $388 billion by the end of 2018.
 
The U.S. spirits market had total revenues of $26.2 billion in 2017, representing more than a 32% increase since 2010, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). The domestic market share of spirits compared to beer and wine was at a record 36.6% in 2017 according to DISCUS, representing more than a 3% gain over beer and wine in terms of market share since 2010.


Key Growth Trends that We Target
 
Craft – The market share of “craft” distillers (defined as any producer that bottles less than 100,000 cases annually) has doubled over the last two years, and is projected to reach 8% by 2020, according to the American Distilling Institute.
 
Women – The United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the “TTB”), Park Street Imports, LLC (“Park Street”) and the US Census Bureau estimate that 37% of all U.S. whiskey drinkers are women.
 
Millennials – Generally, “Millennials” (individuals born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s) value “authenticity” and are inspired by travel, like to try new products and seek new experiences, according to a survey by BeverageDaily.com. Millennials tend to drink a broader range of spirit types (vodka, rum, tequila, whiskey, gin) than prior generations and Millennials consume more expensive spirits than their predecessors. These individuals are often attracted to vintage spirits and cocktails with nostalgic followings, such as throwbacks to the 1950s like rye whiskey, bourbon, and the Manhattan cocktail. According to Barclays Research, millennials increasingly prefer spirits over beer and wine, and flavored spirits in particular. In addition, according to DISCUS, millennials are more willing than prior generations to purchase premium spirits.
 
Flavored – According to DISCUS, flavored spirits sales continue to grow faster than the overall spirits market, and flavored whiskey, which is especially appealing to younger drinkers and women, is the fastest growing flavored spirit category.
 
International – The demand for U.S.-produced spirits abroad is increasing significantly. U.S. spirit exports nearly doubled over the past decade to $1.56 billion in 2015, and whiskey exports were up approximately 5.4% in 2015 compared to 2014. The largest export markets for U.S. spirits include the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, and Japan.
 
Our Strategy and Its Implementation
 
Our objective is to build Eastside Distilling into a strong, nationally competitive and profitable spirits company, with a distinctive portfolio of premium and high-end spirits brands that have national, and even international, consumer appeal and following. Our strategy to accomplish that goal includes:

● | create a “brand factory” to develop and grow emerging spirits and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) brands; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | be an acquisition platform for the fragmented craft spirits industry; and 
● | build cash flow in the Pacific Northwest home market through sales of our locally-created spirits and with our bottling subsidiary to help support our overall growth activities. 

 
To help achieve this, we are focused on:
 

● | achieving world-class spirit rebranding with the collaboration of Sandstrom Partners; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growing organically and by acquisition; 
● | monetizing our diverse and growing product portfolio; 
● | improving margins; and 
● | accelerating our strong double-digit growth in core markets, as well as expanding opportunistically in international markets.

Our Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths will help enable the implementation of our growth strategies:
 

● | Award-Winning, Diverse Product Line: We have a diverse product line, currently offering over a dozen premium craft spirits, many of which have won awards for taste and/or product design. According to a study by the American Craft Spirits Association, the U.S. craft spirits volume of cases sold experienced a compound annual growth rate of 27.4% between 2010 and 2015, and saw an increase in market share from 0.8% to 2.2% during that period. Our sales of premium brands have increased over 1,000% since 2010. We believe our diverse, recognized product line in this growing market will enable us to establish a presence in new geographic markets and enable us to procure additional distributors for our products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Key Relationships: We have distribution arrangements with several of the largest wine and spirits distributors in the United States, such as RNDC and Southern Glazer’s. We have also engaged Park Street, a provider of back-office administrative and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors. We believe these relationships will help accomplish our goal of having our premium spirits sold and distributed nationwide. 
● | Experienced Distilling and Blending Experts: We believe that our team of expert blenders and distillers, with highly regarded “palates” is important to us maintaining a high-quality, artisanal character to our products as well as adding to our consumer appeal. 

Our Product Approach
 
Our approach to or craft spirits involves five important aspects:
 

● | Commitment to Quality: We create and deliver high-quality, innovative products targeted at growing markets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Authentic Yet Scalable: We believe our approach to production allows us to produce our products at scale, while keeping flavor profiles consistent. 
● | Unique Talent and Experience: Every spirit reflects the creativity of our entire team 
● | Extensive Spirit Portfolio: Many craft distillers have only one to three products; we have over a dozen, which we believe affords us the opportunity to target a broader range of consumers with our brands. 
● | Generate Customer Loyalty: These factors attract loyal and enthusiastic customers and major distributors for our products. 

Our Brands
 
We develop, produce and market the premium brands listed below:
 
Burnside. We develop, market and produce several premium, barrel–aged whiskeys and bourbons under our brand name “Burnside.” During 2017, we undertook a major re-branding and market re-positioning strategy with our Burnside-branded products. This effort was led by our marketing partner, Sandstrom Partners. The new branding, packaging and product line expansion was launched late in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current products sold under this brand include: Burnside West End Blend (a blended whiskey), Burnside Oregon Oaked Bourbon (a blended bourbon), Burnside Goose Hollow RSV Bourbon (a special reserve straight bourbon) and Burnside Oregon Oaked Rye (a blended rye whiskey). All of the Burnside products are age-finished in our own in-house, heavily-charred, Oregon-oak barrels, which we believe adds an enhanced and improved flavor profile and provides the products with differentiation in the marketplace. We consider the Burnside products to be “premium” to “ultra-premium” brands. Our Burnside brands accounted for approximately 25% and 40% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales is due to the re-branding of this product line during 2017.
 
Redneck Riviera Whiskey. In October 2017, we were granted an exclusive license for the use of the Redneck Riviera brand for spirits-based products. The Redneck Riviera trademark is owned by Rich Marks, which is controlled by John Rich, a “multiple platinum” country music singer and songwriter who performs with the “Big & Rich” band. In January 2018, we officially launched our first product, Redneck Riviera Whiskey, under this royalty-free, 10-year license. Beginning in 2020, we will be required to meet certain levels of case sales to avoid termination of the license, and if those levels are met, we will be entitled to renew the license in perpetuity or until such time as a sale of the Redneck Riviera spirits brands occurs.

Income from sales of RRW and any subsequent products go entirely to us, less any customary brand development allowances to distributors or other such payment that are within our discretion. We will be reimbursing Mr. Rich for his expenses incurred while performing personal services in marketing the brand. Should Rich Marks choose to sell the Redneck Riviera spirits brand, we and Rich Marks will share equally in the sale proceeds of any brand and other IP developed under the license, based on a sliding scale that gives Rich Marks an increasing percentage of sale proceeds, if any, over $20 million. We have certain rights of first refusal to acquire Rich Mark’s interest should a third party sale be proposed.
 
Barrel Hitch American Whiskey. We market a standard whiskey: Barrel Hitch American Whiskey. Our Barrel Hitch American Whiskey is 80 proof and won a triple-Gold Medal and “best of show” in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards in 2015. Barrel Hitch was introduced in July 2015 and accounted for approximately 11% and 17% of our sales for the years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Premium Vodka. We develop, market and produce a premium potato vodka under the brand name “Portland Potato Vodka”, which is distilled from potatoes rather than grain and, as such, is gluten-free. Our Portland Potato Vodka was awarded a silver medal from the American Wine Society and a gold medal from the Beverage Tasting Institute, which also gave it a “Best Buy” rating. A new product, Hot Potato Vodka, was added to this category in the second quarter of 2017. The vodka is 80 proof and is a combination of habanero pepper and Portland Potato Vodka producing a full-palate explosion of flavor. Our Potato Vodka brands accounted for approximately 22% and 13% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


Distinctive Specialty Whiskeys. We develop, market and produce two distinctive specialty whiskeys: Cherry Bomb Whiskey and Marionberry Whiskey. Our Cherry Bomb Whiskey combines handcrafted small batch whiskey with a blast of real Oregon cherries. Our Cherry Bomb Whiskey won a gold medal from the American Wine Society and was also awarded a gold medal for taste and a silver medal for package design in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards. Our Marionberry whiskey combines Oregon marionberries (a hybrid blackberry) with premium aged whiskey and was awarded two silver medals in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards for taste and package design. Our specialty whiskeys accounted for approximately 13% of our sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Below Deck Rums. We develop, market and produce four rums under the Below Deck brand name: Below Deck Silver Rum, Below Deck Spiced Rum, Below Deck Coffee Rum and Below Deck Ginger Rum. Below Deck’s Silver Rum is our original rum. Below Deck Spiced Rum is double-distilled from molasses and infused with exotic spices and won a triple gold medal for taste and a bronze medal for package design in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards. Our Below Deck Coffee Rum is double-distilled and infused with coffee flavors from Arabica bean and won a silver medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Below Deck Ginger Rum is infused with natural ginger. Our Below Deck Rums accounted for approximately 11% and 10% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Seasonal/Limited Edition Spirits. In addition to our premium bourbons, whiskeys, rum and vodka, we create seasonal and limited-edition handmade products, such as Advocaat (eggnog) Liqueur, Peppermint Bark Liqueur, Bier Schnapps and Holiday Spiced Liqueur. Our Seasonal/Limited Edition Spirits accounted for approximately 6% of our sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
BBD Spirits. We also acquired several other brands as a result of our acquisition of BBD in May 2017. The extensive BBD product portfolio includes several craft spirits that we believe are highly complementary to our product line, including The Ninety One Gin, Navy Strength Gin (114 proof) and Delta Rye (111 proof) rye whiskey, among others. Inspired by the craft spirits movement in Oregon, Big Bottom Distillery’s small-batch, hand-crafted spirits provide consumers with unique takes on traditional spirits. BBD products accounted for approximately 3% of our sales in 2017.


MotherLode LLC. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, MotherLode, historically has provided bottling services, as well as production support to customers such as other craft spirit and wine producers. MotherLode recently added the ability to provide canning services to customers for wine and Ready to Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic drinks. The custom built canning line is designed to produce Ball Corporation’s popular “slim can” in 187 ml, 200 ml and 250 ml sizes, with 250 ml being equal to approximately 8.45 ounces. The new line was recently completed, and MotherLode expects to begin providing canning to initial customers in the near-future. MotherLode accounted for approximately 9% of our sales in 2017.

Production and Supply
 
There are several steps in the production and supply process for beverage alcohol products. First, all of our spirits products are distilled. This is a multi-stage process that converts basic ingredients, such as grain, sugar cane or agave, into alcohol. Next, the alcohol is processed and/or aged in various ways depending on the requirements of the specific brand. For our vodka, this processing is designed to remove all other chemicals, so that the resulting liquid will be odorless and colorless, and have a smooth quality with minimal harshness. Achieving a high level of purity involves a series of distillations and filtration processes. For our large production products, we currently source full strength and barrel strength (reduced ABV due to evaporation) that we further process (such as aging in Oregon Oak, or adding ingredients) and bottle at our premises.
 
For our spirits brands, rather than removing flavor, various complex flavor profiles are achieved through one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit, addition of various flavoring substances, and, in the case of rums and whiskeys, aging of the brands in various types of casks for extended periods of time, as well as the blending of several rums or whiskeys to achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand. After the distillation, purification and flavoring processes are completed, the various liquids are bottled. This involves several important stages, including bottle and label design and procurement, filling of the bottles and packaging the bottles in various configurations for shipment.
 
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of our spirit products and raw materials, including our distillate products and other ingredients. These suppliers consist of third-party producers in the U.S. We do not have long-term, written agreements with any of our suppliers. However, we believe that we have consistent and reliable third-party sources for spirit product. However, we produce and bottle our spirits for distribution, whether the distilling stage of the process was at our facility or not.
 
Distribution Network
 
We believe that the distribution network that we have developed with our sales team and our independent distributors and brokers is one of our key strengths. We currently have distribution and brokerage relationships with third-party distributors in 26 U.S. states.
 
U.S. Distribution
 
Importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically, an imported brand is first sold to a U.S. importer, who then sells it to a network of distributors, or wholesalers, covering the U.S., in either “open” states or “control” states. In the 33 open states, the distributors are generally large, privately-held companies. In the 18 control states, the states themselves function as the distributor, and regulate suppliers, including our company. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and other outlets licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. In larger states, such as New York, more than one distributor may handle a brand in separate geographical areas. In control states, importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities, which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies, while maintaining strict control over pricing and profit.
 
The U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. There are currently eight major spirits companies, each of which own and operate their own importing businesses. All companies, including these large companies, are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the U.S. The major companies are exerting increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result, it has become more difficult for smaller companies to get their products recognized by the distributors.
 
Importation
 
We hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, and the requisite state licenses within the states we conduct business.
 
Our inventory is maintained in our warehouse and shipped nationally by our network of licensed and bonded carriers.
 
Wholesalers and Distributors
 
In the U.S., we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in the control states, state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result, we depend on distributors for sales, for product placement and for retail store penetration. All of the distributors we currently work with also distribute our competitors’ products and brands. As a result, we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team, we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in the twenty-six states we sell our products, and our products are sold in the U.S. by these wholesale distributors, as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.

Other Sources of Revenue
 
Special Events
 
We also generate sales from participating in special events (such as farmers’ markets, trade shows, hosting private tastings, etc.). We offer tastings as well as sell merchandise and bottle sales and have generated as much as $75,000 in sales from these special events in a single month, particularly during the winter holiday season (November/December). In addition to the sales these events generate, we value the immediate customer feedback during these activities, which is instrumental in creating better products and testing new flavors.
Retail Stores and Kiosks
 
We currently have three retail stores in shopping centers in the Portland, Oregon area that provide us with additional opportunities for sales of our products. During the holiday season (November and December) we also expand our retail operations by opening additional temporary locations, usually within high-traffic shopping malls in the Portland metro region. We intend to maintain these retail stores and kiosks to build local brand awareness and direct-to-consumer retail sales. These stores provide in-store tastings, which we believe leads to additional product purchases.
Significant Customers
 
Sales to one distributor, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated sales for each of the years 2017 and 2016.
 
Sales Team
 
We have a total sales force of 11 people, with an average of over ten years of industry experience with premium beverage alcohol brands.
 
Our sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors, which includes setting quotas, coordinating promotional plans for our brands, maintaining adequate levels of stock, brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel. Our sales team also maintains relationships with key retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional events, create local brand promotion plans, host in-store tastings, where permitted, and provide wait staff and bartender training and education for our brands.
 
In addition, we have also engaged Park Street Imports, a provider of back-office administrative and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors, which services include state compliance, logistics planning, order processing, distributor chargeback and bill-support management and certain accounting and reporting services.
 
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 
To build our brands, we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: our distributors, the retail trade and the end consumer. Advertising, marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts to build substantial brand value.
 
In late 2016, to aid us in this strategy, we retained Sandstrom Partners, a Portland-based firm specializing in spirits branding, and tasked them with reviewing our current product portfolio, as well as our new ideas, and advising us on marketing, creation of brand awareness and product positioning, locally and nationally. We are using Sandstrom’s full range of brand development services, including research, strategy, brand identity, package design, environments, advertising as well as digital design and development. During 2017, Sandstrom helped us successfully re-brand our key Burnside product as well as developed the branding for our new “Redneck Riviera” brand.
 
We also employ two in-house marketing and customer service personnel who work together with third party design and advertising firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our product categories and build brand awareness through innovative marketing activities. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales, including consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, in-store and on-premise promotions and public relations, as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques, including social media marketing, to support our brands.
 
Besides traditional advertising, we also employ three other marketing methods to support our brands: public relations, event sponsorships and tastings. Our significant U.S. public relations efforts have helped gain editorial coverage for our brands, which increases brand awareness. Event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands. We actively contribute product to trend-setting events where our brand has exclusivity in the brand category. We also conduct hundreds of in-store and on-premise promotions each year.
 
We support our brand marketing efforts with an assortment of point-of-sale materials. The combination of trade and consumer programs, supported by attractive point-of-sale materials, also establishes greater credibility for us with our distributors and retailers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the U.S. where we distribute, or plan to distribute, our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiary. In the U.S., trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.
Seasonality
 
Our industry is subject to seasonality with peak retail sales generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Historically, this holiday demand has resulted in higher sales for us in our fourth quarter.
Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We believe that we compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, retail shelf space, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have greater resources than us.

Over the past ten years, the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today there are eight major companies: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A., and Remy Cointreau S.A.
 
We believe that we are in a better position to partner with small-to-mid-size brands than the major importers. Despite our relative capital position and resources, we have been able to compete with these larger companies in pursuing agency distribution agreements and acquiring brands by being more responsive to private and family-owned brands, offering flexible transaction structures and providing brand owners the option to retain local production and “home” market sales. Given our size relative to our major competitors, most of which have multi-billion dollar operations, we believe that we can provide greater focus on smaller brands and tailor transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However, our relative capital position and resources may limit our marketing capabilities, limit our ability to expand into new markets and limit our negotiating ability with our distributors.
 
By focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market, which typically have higher margins, and having an established, experienced sales force, we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of our size. Also, the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create an opportunity for small to mid-size wine and spirits companies, such as ourselves, as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, U.S. Customs Laws, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of all fifty states.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
We are subject to U.S. regulations on the advertising, marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range from a complete prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some states to restrictions on the advertising style, media and messages used.
 
Labeling of spirits is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products.
 
In the U.S. control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products not selected for listings only through special orders, if at all.
 
The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally. Most foreign countries impose excise duties on wines and distilled spirits, although the form of such taxation varies from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs. Once we begin distributing our products internationally, import and excise duties could have a significant effect on our sales, both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.
 
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state and other regulations. However, we operate in a highly regulated industry which may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future compliance costs due to regulatory changes could be significant.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 full-time employees, 13 of whom were in sales and marketing and four of whom were in management and 8 in administration and production.
