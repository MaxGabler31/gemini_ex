--------+---------

 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I—“Risk Factors.”
 
Odyssey Group International, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation in March 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 2372 Morse Ave., Irvine, CA 92614The registration statement effectuating our initial public offering became effective in July 2015. We are an emerging growth company.
 
Our common stock is not listed or traded on any exchange or automated quotation system so there is currently no public market for our common stock. We are in the process of applying for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved.
 
As used herein, when we refer to “OGI,” the “company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean Odyssey Group International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
JOBS Act
 
Recently the United States Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), which provides for certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to public companies that are reporting companies and are “emerging growth companies.” We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 3(a) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012), and we will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC) or more; (b) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (c) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b–2. Therefore, we expect to continue to be an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future.
 
Generally, a registrant that registers any class of its securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is required to include in the second and all subsequent annual reports filed by it under the Exchange Act a management report on internal control over financial reporting and, subject to an exemption available to registrants that meet the definition of a “smaller reporting company” in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, an auditor attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from the requirement to include an auditor attestation report in our annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, even if we do not qualify as a “smaller reporting company”. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are able to avail ourselves to the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and not to present to our stockholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, obtain approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved or present the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and our financial performance. We have irrevocably elected to comply with new or revised accounting standards even though we are an emerging growth company.

General
 
Odyssey Group International, Inc. (“Odyssey” or “the Company”), was formed as a publicly held holding company with an emphasis on the development and acquisition of medical devices and health related technologies. The Company is focused on building and acquiring assets in areas that have an identified technological advantage and a substantial market opportunity within significant target markets across the globe.
 
The corporate mission is to create or acquire distinct assets, intellectual property, and technologies with an emphasis on acquisition targets that generate positive cash flow. Our strategic mission is to deliver financial results, which yield high rates of returns for our shareholders and partners. The Company’s senior management team and leadership have significant experience and capabilities to further refine the technologies as we build our distribution system
 
Our Company is a trans-disciplinary product development enterprise involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of a broad range of products applied to our target industries. The Company has developed, and subsequent to July 31, 2014, began marketing a product called “Fit” to provide athletic enhancement products to improve the human body’s function during athletic stress. We currently own or control all proprietary rights in and to the formula called Fit as well as the respective rights, titles and interests in and to the formula. The formula is not patent protected, but is maintained solely as a trade secret. The Company no longer markets this product. The Company has also acquired the right to sell and distribute a technology called CardioMap®, which is an advanced technology for early non-invasive testing for heart disease. In 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Insane Power LV, Inc. to create products for the retail sales channel for custom autos. In 2018, the Company sold its interest in this joint venture at cost. The research and development expenses that the Company assumed were reversed and attached directly to the joint venture for control and ownership of that research and development.
 
Our business model is to develop or acquire medical related products, engage third parties to manufacture such products and then distribute the products through various distribution channels, including third parties. We intend to focus on the commercialization of CardioMap®.
 
We intend to acquire other technologies and assets and plan to be a trans-disciplinary product development company involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of products and technologies that may be applied over various medical markets.
 
We intend to license, improve and/or develop our products and identify and select distribution channels. We intend to establish agreements with distributors to get products to market quickly as well as to undertake and engage in our own direct marketing efforts. We will determine the most effective method of distribution for each unique product that we include in our portfolio.
 
We intend to engage third party research and development firms who specialize in the creation of our products to assist us in the development of our own products We intend to apply for trademarks and patents once we have developed proprietary products.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Once FDA cleared to market the CardioMap product, n addition to distributing domestically, we intend to enter into license agreements with qualified distributors in Europe, South America, India and China. We intend to require such licensees to pay to our company an initial license fee as well as royalties based on gross sales. Retaining exclusivity, we will bill based on a mutually agreeable semi-annual or quarterly sales minimum. We have determined to focus on international growth because generally such international license agreements provide a stronger path to revenue and earnings than purely domestic products.
 
Our objective is to grow revenue through marketing and sales of each of our current products, including Fit and with increased focus on CardioMap®. Although no assurances can be given, management anticipates company growth from the following areas:
 

1) | Distribution Agreements. In most cases, we will enter into distribution agreements with companies who already have sales professionals that already have experience selling health supplements through a variety of sales methods. These distribution agreements will allow us to more quickly achieve sales and revenue in the health products industries. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Generate revenues from sales of CardioMap® and through the development and distribution of new products. We intend to market CardioMap® through third party distributors and through our own efforts, and we intend to market any new products that may be developed or acquired. We also intend to use other marketing and sales methods we have not implemented. We intend to develop such opportunities if and as they present themselves as capital resources permit.
3) | Identify and develop CardioMap® for additional proprietary uses of the product. We intend to identify and find new areas of the human body to map utilizing CardioMap® technology such as the brain, liver and kidney. 

 
About CardioMap®
 
The CardioMap® System is an internet service based on the new development of Dispersion Mapping Method in ECG analysis for the early, non-invasive testing of a heart disease (CHD). The heart monitoring system provides high quality 3-D visualization and diagnosis of the heart using advanced signal analysis.
 
Once FDA cleared, CardioMap® could provide a better level of diagnosis with its improved sensitivity levels that can detect early warning signs that would normally be invisible with standard ECG devices. The system can dramatically cut the costs associated with the detection of ischemic heart disease and will prove to be an invaluable testing device for cardiologists, physicians, clinics, hospitals, the fitness industry, sports teams, emergency facilities and general public. CardioMap® was developed by VE Science Technology LLC, from whom we have purchased the product rights.
 
Competition
 
We believe that the primary competition for our services is from existing companies offering EKG equipment. None of these companies have the level of sensitivity as the CardioMap technology and none have dispersion mapping as part of their product offering.

Governmental Regulation
 
Product Regulation 
 
Domestic. The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products may be subject to certain regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the Federal Drug Administration (the “FDA”), Housing and Human Services (the “HHS”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”), the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. 
 
In order to sell, market and distribute the CardioMap product, clearance from the FDA is required. Such clearance has not been obtained at this time.
 
As a result of our efforts to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we intend to, from time to time, as the regulations are updated reformulate, eliminate or relabel our products if necessary and revise certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
 
Foreign. Any products we eventually sell in foreign countries are also subject to regulation under various national, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. Government regulations in foreign countries may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of some of our products.
