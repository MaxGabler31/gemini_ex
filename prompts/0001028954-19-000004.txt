ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General

SB One Bancorp is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey under the name Sussex Bancorp in January 1996.  On May 3, 2018, we changed our name to SB One Bancorp. The Company is the parent company of SB One Bank, formerly known as Sussex Bank (the “Bank”).  The only significant asset of SB One Bancorp is its investment in the Bank.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated total assets of $1.8 billion, gross loans of $1.5 billion, deposits of $1.4 billion and stockholders’ equity of $185.4 million.

The Bank is a commercial bank formed under the laws of the State of New Jersey in 1975 and is regulated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the “Department”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).  The Bank’s wholly owned subsidiaries are SCB Investment Company, Inc., SCBNY Company, Inc., ClassicLake Enterprises, LLC, PPD Holding Company, LLC, Community Investing Company, Inc., GFR Maywood LLC, 490 Boulevard Realty Corp., and SB One Insurance Agency, Inc. (“SB One Insurance”).  SCB Investment Company, Inc., Community Investing Company, Inc. and SCBNY Company, Inc. hold portions of the Bank’s investment portfolio.  ClassicLake Enterprises, LLC, PPD Holding Company, LLC, hold certain foreclosed properties. SB One Insurance provides insurance agency services mostly through the sale of property and casualty insurance policies. 

The corporate office of the Company is located at 100 Enterprise Drive, Suite 700, Rockaway, New Jersey, 07866, and the telephone number is (844) 256-7328.
Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ Acquisition
On January 4, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ (“Community”). In connection with the acquisition, Community merged with and into SB One Bank, with SB One Bank continuing as the surviving entity.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company also acquired certain subsidiaries of Community.
Enterprise Bank, NJ Acquisition
On December 21, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Enterprise, NJ (“Enterprise”). In connection with the acquisition, Enterprise merged with and into SB One Bank, with SB One Bank continuing as the surviving entity.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company also acquired certain subsidiaries of Enterprise.
Our Business

Our primary business is ownership and supervision of the Bank.  Through the Bank, we conduct a traditional commercial banking business, and offer services including personal and business checking accounts and time deposits, money market accounts and savings accounts.  We structure our specific services and charges in a manner designed to attract the business of the small and medium sized business and professional community as well as that of individuals residing, working and shopping in the northern New Jersey and New York markets.  We engage in a wide range of lending activities and offer commercial, consumer, mortgage, home equity and personal loans.

Through the Bank’s subsidiary, SB One Insurance, we operate a full service general insurance agency, offering both commercial and personal lines of insurance. 

We have two business segments, banking and financial services and insurance services. For financial data on the segments see Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.

Market Area

Our service area primarily consists of Sussex, Morris, Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, and Union Counties in New Jersey and Queens County, New York; however, we make loans throughout New Jersey and the New York metropolitan markets.   We operate from our corporate office in Rockaway, New Jersey, and, as of December 31, 2018, our eighteen branch offices located in Andover, 
1

Augusta, Bloomfield, Edison, Fair Lawn, Franklin, Hackettstown, Kenilworth, Maywood, Montague, Newark, Newton, Oradell, Rochelle Park, Sparta, Vernon, and Wantage, New Jersey, and in Astoria, New York, our regional office and corporate center in Rochelle Park, New Jersey and Wantage, New Jersey and our insurance agency offices in Augusta and Oradell, New Jersey. Our market area is among the most affluent in the nation. Following the completion of the acquisition of Community on January 4, 2018, the Bank has an additional three branches located in Bergen County. Following the completion of the acquisition of Enterprise on December 21, 2018, the Bank has one branch located in Union County, one branch located in Middlesex County and two branches located in Essex County. On December 21, 2018, we announced the closing of our Andover, New Jersey branch location effective March 29, 2019. 

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive environment competing for deposits and loans with commercial banks, thrifts and other financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources than us.  Many large financial institutions in New York City and other parts of New Jersey compete for the business of customers located in our service area.  Many of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than us and provide services to their customers which we do not offer.

Management believes we are able to compete on a substantially equal basis with our competitors because we provide responsive personalized services through management’s knowledge and awareness of our service area, customers and business.

Personnel

At December 31, 2018, we employed 216 full-time employees and 21 part-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Supervision and Regulation

The Company, the Bank and certain of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws.  The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect investors in bank holding companies such as the Company. 
Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. The summary that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Statutes, regulations and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies.  A change in any statute, regulation or policy applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries may have a material effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance. Financial reform legislation and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), may have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment and our ability to conduct business.  As a result, we may incur additional expenses to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.
Overview

The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  As a registered bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the BHC Act, and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the FRB.  The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC.  The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the trading symbol, “SBBX,” and the Company is subject to the NASDAQ rules for listed companies.  

The Bank is organized as a state-chartered commercial bank pursuant to the banking laws and regulations of the Department.  The Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Department as its primary chartering authority, as well as by the FDIC as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer.  Financial products and services offered by the Company and the Bank are subject to federal consumer protection laws and regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).  The Company, the Bank and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries must also comply with state consumer protection laws which are enforced by state attorneys general.  The Bank`s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations.  The non-bank subsidiaries of the Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the FRB, the FDIC and the Department, respectively.  Insurance agencies are licensed by the State of New Jersey and are regulated by the Department under state law.

The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the U.S. financial regulatory landscape.  Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the federal banking agencies.  As a result, management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or the extent to which it could affect operations of the Company and the Bank.

Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a bank holding company under the BHC Act.  The BHC Act generally limits the business of the Company to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking “as to be a proper incident thereto.”  The Company is required to file periodic reports with the FRB and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.

The BHC Act requires, among other things, prior FRB approval where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other bank, (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock of any bank or its parent company (unless it owns a majority of such bank’s voting shares) or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.  The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger, or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. When reviewing acquisitions or mergers, the FRB also considers, among other factors: (i) capital adequacy; (ii) the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the banks concerned; (iii) the convenience and needs of the community to be served; (iv) banks' record under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”); and (v) the effectiveness of the companies and the banks in combating money laundering.

The BHC Act also generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from (i) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company; or (ii) engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or performing services for its subsidiaries, unless such non‑banking business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks “as to be properly incident thereto”.  In making such determinations, the FRB is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public, such as, greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as, undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.

Bank holding companies whose subsidiary banks meet certain capital, management and standards under the CRA, that elect to become “financial holding companies,” are permitted to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking financial activities than is otherwise permissible for bank holding companies under the BHC Act.  These activities include, among others, certain insurance, securities and merchant banking activities.  As our business is currently limited to activities permissible for a bank holding company, we have not elected to become a financial holding company.

Mergers and Acquisitions

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statures regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions. The BHC Act requires the prior FRB approval for a bank holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a bank without providing 60 days` prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency.
Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and purchase and assumption transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant`s performance record under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. For further information relating to the CRA, see "Community Reinvestment Act of 1977" below.
Source of Strength Doctrine

FRB policy requires that bank holding companies act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks.  Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codifies the requirement that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial 
3

strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.  As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources.  Any capital loan by the Company to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank.  The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as the Company, from: (i) engaging in “proprietary trading” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (“Covered Funds”), subject to certain limited exceptions. The implementing regulation defines a Covered Fund to include certain investments such as collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) and collateralized debt obligation securities. The regulation also provides, among other exemptions, an exemption for CLOs meeting certain requirements.  The Company is fully compliant with the Volcker Rule.  Given the Company’s size and the scope of its activities, the Company's implementation of the Volcker Rule had no significant effect on its financial statements.
Dividend Rights

The principal source of the Company’s liquidity is dividends from the Bank.  As a New Jersey-chartered bank, the Bank may declare and pay dividends only if, after payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the Bank will be unimpaired and either the Bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the Bank’s surplus.
The Company`s ability to pay dividends is subject to the regulatory authority of the FRB. The supervisory concern of the FRB focuses on a bank holding company`s capital position, its ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due, and its capacity to act as a source of financial strength to its insured depository institution subsidiaries. In addition, FRB policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company that is not supported by current operating earnings.
Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action

In July 2013, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) and the FDIC approved final rules (the “Capital Rules”) that established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (the “Basel Committee”) December 2010 final capital framework referred to as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards. In addition, the Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules.

The Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposures and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid, low-risk assets. The Capital Rules apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, and to certain bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets if they are engaged in substantial non-banking activity or meet certain other criteria.  Under FRB reporting requirements, a bank holding company that reaches $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of June 30 of the preceding year must begin reporting its consolidated capital beginning in March of the following year. The threshold for capital consolidation was raised from $500 million to $1 billion effective May 15, 2015. The Company will begin reporting its consolidated capital on March, 31, 2019, as it reached $1 billion in total consolidated assets as of June 30, 2018.

The Capital Rules: (i) require a capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. The Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital and impacted the calculation of the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios.  The Capital Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions.  Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules’ specific requirements.

Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:


• | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;


• | 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and


• | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (the “leverage ratio”).

The Capital Rules also requires a “capital conservation buffer,” composed entirely of CET1, in addition to these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the capital standards applicable to the Bank will include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. The deduction and adjustments will be incrementally phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019.
In addition, under the prior general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (“AOCI”) items included in shareholders’ equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, banking organizations not using the advanced approaches, including the Bank were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in January 2015.   The Bank elected to make the one-time permanent election to exclude certain AOCI items for regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, from inclusion in bank holding companies’ Tier 1 capital.
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increases by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. governmental and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes.
Pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"), federal banking agencies are required to take "prompt corrective action" should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. For purposes of prompt corrective action, to be: (i) well-capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%; (ii) adequately capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%; (iii) undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%; (iv) significantly undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%; and (v) critically undercapitalized, a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2%.
Bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; 
5

the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; the termination of the bank's deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.
Management believes that the Bank is in compliance, and will remain in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios as such capital requirements are phased in.
Depositor Preference
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution
Federal Deposit Insurance

The Bank`s deposit accounts are fully insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the deposit insurance limits of $250,000 per depositor, per insured institution, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that accounts for a bank's capital level and supervisory rating (“CAMELS rating”).  The risk matrix uses different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings.  The base for deposit insurance assessments is consolidated average assets less average tangible equity.  Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed.  In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the FDIA provides for additional assessments to be imposed on insured depository institutions to pay for the cost of Financing Corporation (“FICO”) funding.  The FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation.  The FICO assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base of the DIF and do not vary depending upon a depository institution’s capitalization or supervisory evaluation.
Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that an insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company’s management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to the termination of deposit insurance.
Reserve Requirements
FRB regulations require insured depository institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primary interest-bearing and regular checking accounts).  The Bank’s required reserves can be in the form of vault cash.  If vault cash does not fully satisfy the required reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  In 2018 FRB regulations required that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts, except for transaction accounts which are exempt up to $16.0 million. Transaction accounts greater than $16.0 million up to and including $122.3 million have a reserve requirement of 3%.  A 10% reserve ratio will be assessed on transaction accounts in excess of $122.3 million. The FRB makes annual adjustments to the tiered reserves.  The Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Under federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”) and its implementing Regulation W. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
6

Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (“insiders”). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution’s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank’s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers.

Anti-Money-Laundering

The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”), imposes obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. The USA PATRIOT Act also encourages information-sharing among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities by providing an exemption from the privacy provisions of the GLB Act for financial institutions that comply with this provision. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act, which applies to the Bank, or the BHC Act, which applies to the Company. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank believe that they are in compliance with the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act, and implementing regulations thereof.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision
The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for federal consumer financial protection in the CFPB, which is an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations.  The Company and the Bank are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy. Among others, these laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which is part of the Dodd-Frank Act and established the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company`s business, financial condition or operations.
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977

The Bank has a responsibility under the CRA to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community consistent with the CRA.  Regulators periodically assess the Bank’s record of compliance with the CRA.  In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of 
7

characteristics specified in those statutes. The Bank’s failure to comply with the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company.  The Bank`s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination.
Financial Privacy and Data Security

The Company is subject to federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”), and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated institutions. These provision require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of “opt out” or “opt in” authorizations. 
The GLBA requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information. 
The federal banking agencies, including the FRB, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cybersecurity risks and identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third party services providers. FFIEC has provided a Cybersecurity Assessment Toll for institutions to identity and address cybersecurity risks in their systems. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g., consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft prevention program. This program must include reasonable policies and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such as inconsistencies in personal information or changes in account activity.
Employee Compensation

The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured.
Future Legislative Initiatives
From time to time, federal and state legislatures may introduce legislation that will impact the financial services industry. In addition, the federal banking agencies may introduce regulatory initiatives that are likely to impact the financial services industry. However, it is not clear whether such changes will be enacted or, if enacted, what effect such changes would have on the Company. New legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced by Congress, state legislatures, and financial regulatory agencies.  Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and/or depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system.  Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways.  If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.  A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
