ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Churchill Downs Incorporated (the "Company", "we", "us", "our") is an industry-leading racing, online wagering and gaming entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event, the Kentucky Derby. We own and operate three pari-mutuel gaming entertainment venues with approximately 3,050 historical racing machines ("HRMs") in Kentucky. We also own and operate TwinSpires, one of the largest and most profitable online wagering platforms for horse racing, sports and iGaming in the U.S. and we have nine retail sportsbooks. We are also a leader in brick-and-mortar casino gaming in eight states with approximately 11,000 slot machines and video lottery terminals ("VLTs") and 200 table games. We were organized as a Kentucky corporation in 1928, and our principal executive offices are in Louisville, Kentucky.
Impact of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in travel limitations and business and government shutdowns which had a significant negative economic impact in the United States and to our business. Although vaccines are available, we cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variant strains, will continue to impact the Company remains uncertain and will depend on many factors that are not within our control. 
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we temporarily suspended operations at our wholly owned and managed gaming properties, announced the temporary furlough of our employees at these properties and certain racing operations and implemented a temporary salary reduction for all remaining non-furloughed salaried employees based on a percentage that varied dependent upon the amount of each employee’s salary. The most senior level of executive management received the largest salary decrease, based on both percentage and dollar amount. 
In May 2020, we began to reopen our properties with patron restrictions and gaming limitations. One property suspended operations again in July 2020 and reopened in August 2020, and three properties suspended operations in December 2020 and reopened in January 2021. All of our gaming properties have remained open since January 2021. Although all of our properties are now open to customers, certain locations continue to operate with certain restrictions, and the continued impact of the pandemic could result in further suspension of operations. 
The 146th Kentucky Oaks and Derby were held in the third quarter of 2020 without spectators. During the second quarter of 2021, we held the 147th Kentucky Oaks and Derby with capacity restrictions in compliance with Kentucky venue limitations at that time. The capacity restrictions limited reserved seating in each area to approximately 40% to 60% capacity and limited general admission tickets. Due to such restrictions, our revenues from the Kentucky Oaks and Derby in each year were significantly less than we would otherwise expect. 
Business Segments 
During the first quarter of 2021, we updated our operating segments to reflect the internal management reporting used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate results of operations and to assess performance and allocate resources. Our internal management reporting changed primarily due to the continued growth from Oak Grove Racing, Gaming & Hotel ("Oak Grove") and Turfway Park Racing & Gaming (“Turfway Park”), which opened its annex HRM facility, Newport Racing & Gaming ("Newport"), in October 2020, which resulted in our chief operating decision maker's decision to include Oak Grove, Turfway Park and Newport in the new Live and Historical Racing segment. The Live and Historical Racing segment now includes Churchill Downs Racetrack, Derby City Gaming, Oak Grove, Turfway Park, and Newport. We also realigned our retail sports betting results at our wholly owned casinos from our Gaming segment to our TwinSpires segment. As a result of this realignment, our operating segments that meet the requirements to be disclosed separately as reportable segments are: Live and Historical Racing, TwinSpires, and Gaming. Financial information about these segments is set forth in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained within this Report. 
We conduct our business through these reportable segments and report net revenue and operating expense associated with these reportable segments in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, contained within this Report. The prior year results in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were reclassified to conform to this presentation. 
Live and Historical Racing
The Live and Historical Racing segment includes live and historical pari-mutuel racing related revenue and expenses at Churchill Downs Racetrack, Derby City Gaming, Oak Grove, Turfway Park, and Newport.
Churchill Downs Racetrack is the home of the Kentucky Derby and conducts live racing. Derby City Gaming is an HRM facility that operates under the Churchill Downs pari-mutuel racing license at the auxiliary training facility for Churchill Downs Racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky. Oak Grove conducts live harness racing and operates an HRM facility under its pari-mutuel racing license. Turfway Park conducts live racing, and Newport is an ancillary HRM facility that operates under the Turfway Park pari-mutuel racing license.
Our Live and Historical Racing properties earn commissions primarily from pari-mutuel wagering on live and historical races; simulcast fees earned from other wagering sites; admissions, personal seat licenses, sponsorships, television rights, and other miscellaneous services (collectively "racing event-related services"), as well as food and beverage services.
Churchill Downs Racetrack
Churchill Downs Racetrack is in Louisville, Kentucky and is an internationally known thoroughbred racing operation best known as the home of our iconic flagship event, the Kentucky Derby. We have conducted thoroughbred racing continuously at Churchill Downs Racetrack since 1875. The Kentucky Derby is the longest continuously held annual sporting event in the U.S. and is the first race of the annual series of races for 3-year-old thoroughbreds known as the Triple Crown. The demographic profile of our guests, global television viewership and long-running nature of this iconic event are attractive to sponsors and corporate partners, especially those with luxury and/or marquee brands. 
We conducted 74 live racing days in 2019, 65 live race days in 2020, and 71 live race days in 2021. In 2022, we anticipate conducting up to 77 live race days. 
Churchill Downs Racetrack is located on 175 acres and has a one-mile dirt track, a 7/8-mile turf track, a stabling area, and a variety of areas, structures, and buildings that provide seating for approximately 59,000 of our patrons. We also own 83 acres of land at our auxiliary training facility, which is five miles from Churchill Downs Racetrack. Churchill Downs Racetrack has one of the largest 4K video boards in the world sitting 80 feet above the ground and measuring 171 feet wide by 90 feet tall. This video board provides views of the finish line and the entire race for on-track guests, including those in the infield and guests along the entire front side of the racetrack. The facility also has permanent lighting to accommodate night races. We have a saddling paddock, and the stable area has barns sufficient to accommodate 1,400 horses and a 114-room dormitory for backstretch personnel. The Churchill Downs Racetrack facility also includes a simulcast wagering facility.
In 2002, we transferred title of the Churchill Downs Racetrack facility to the City of Louisville, Kentucky and entered into a 30-year lease for the facility as part of the financing of improvements to the Churchill Downs Racetrack facility. We can reacquire the facility at any time for $1.00 subject to the terms of the lease.
In April 2020, we completed a state-of-the-art equine medical center and quarantine barns on the backside area of Churchill Downs Racetrack which reinforces our ongoing commitment to equine and jockey safety and supports our long-term international growth strategy. 
In July 2021, we announced three major multi-year capital investments to transform key areas of Churchill Downs Racetrack: The Homestretch Club, the Turn 1 Experience, and the Paddock and Under the Spires projects. 
The Company is investing $45.0 million in the Homestretch Club project. The Homestretch Club will replace the grandstand area below the Jockey Club suites and alongside the Winner’s Circle suites on the homestretch. The Homestretch Club project will convert 5,200 outdoor bleacher seats into 3,250 premium reserved seats with all-inclusive amenities. Plans for the new area include 2,610 stadium club seats, 66 covered terraced dining tables for up to 440 guests, 30 Trackside Lounges for up to 200 guests offering a “courtside seat” experience, five private 60-person VIP Hospitality Lounges as upgrades and an 18,600 square-foot indoor hospitality space with a grand staircase and 100-foot feature bar. The Company is planning to debut the new area in May 2022 for the 148th Kentucky Derby.
The Company is investing $90.0 million in the Turn 1 Experience project. The Turn 1 Experience will provide additional permanent stadium seating and a new track-level hospitality club replacing current temporary Oaks and Derby seating at the first turn of the racetrack. Plans for the new area will replace 3,400 temporary seats with 5,100 permanent covered stadium seats and a new 50,000 square-foot climate-controlled hospitality venue with reserved dining room tables, a trackside viewing terrace, and two new seating concourses to allow for better guest circulation and amenities for an incremental 2,000 reserved seats. The Company is planning to debut the new area in May 2023 for the 149th Kentucky Derby.
The Company is also developing a newly designed Paddock and Under the Spires area to enhance the experience for nearly every guest. The redesigned area will improve the flow of guests throughout the Paddock. The project will create a larger paddock walking ring for viewing the horses prior to the races, a new Paddock Club in the area on the first floor under the Twin Spires that will provide views of the paddock and views of the tunnel that the horses walk through, new hospitality and other amenities for guests in certain areas of the 3rd floor clubhouse seats, and new terraces including a new Turf Club balcony overlooking the Paddock. The Company is planning to debut these new areas in May 2024 for the 150th Kentucky Derby. 
Derby City Gaming
Derby City Gaming is an 85,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art HRM facility that was opened in September 2018 at the Churchill Downs Racetrack auxiliary training facility in Louisville, Kentucky.

Plans for the project will add 135,000 square feet to the facility and the new gaming space will open with 200 additional gaming positions. The new gaming expansion will include a VIP gaming area, a new sports bar, a stage for live entertainment and an upscale-casual restaurant and bar to create a variety of new food and beverage options for gaming and hotel guests throughout the entire day. The new gaming space expansion is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the hotel is scheduled for completion by second quarter of 2023.
Derby City Gaming Downtown
In September 2021, we announced plans to invest $80.0 million to build a new HRM entertainment venue called Derby City Gaming Downtown ("DCG Downtown") in an existing building in downtown Louisville. Plans for DCG Downtown will include 500 HRMs, three unique bar concepts and over 200 onsite parking spaces. The new entertainment venue will provide guests, including locals, tourists, and convention attendees, a main-level sports bar with a stage for music and live entertainment, a premium bourbon library and an elegant wine and charcuterie lounge. A retail and merchandise store will be located on the street level where guests can shop for Kentucky Derby-themed merchandise. The Company completed the purchase of the building and property in December 2021 for $5.2 million. DCG Downtown is anticipated to open in mid-2023.

Competition
Overview
We operate in a highly competitive industry with many participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than ours. The industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports, fantasy sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Our brick-and-mortar casinos compete with traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries, and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
Legalized gambling is currently permitted in various forms in many states and Canada. Other jurisdictions could legalize gambling in the future, and established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion of existing gaming operations. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing or gaming operations, such gaming operations could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In May 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had effectively banned sports wagering in most states. Removal of the ban gives states the authority to authorize sports wagering. 
Live and Historical Racing
In 2021, approximately 34,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the U.S., which was up 21% compared to 2020 due to the impact of almost all of the racetracks across the U.S. being closed for a portion of the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a racetrack operator, we compete for horses with other racetracks running live racing meets at or near the same time as our races. Our ability to compete is substantially dependent on the racing calendar, number of horses racing and purse sizes. As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races. In recent years, competition has increased as more states legalize gaming and allow slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions. Derby City Gaming, Oak Grove, Turfway Park, and Newport compete with regional casinos in the area and other forms of legal and illegal gaming. 
TwinSpires
Horse Racing
Our TwinSpires Horse Racing business competes with other ADW businesses for both customers and racing content, as well as brick-and-mortar racetracks, casinos, OTBs, and other forms of legal and illegal sports betting. 
Sports and Casino
Our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business competes for customers with retail, mobile and online offerings from commercial brick-and-mortar casinos and racetracks.  We also compete with daily fantasy sports gaming companies that are expanding into mobile and online sports betting and iGaming, international sports betting businesses looking to expand into the U.S. market, and other forms of legal and illegal sports betting and iGaming operations.
Gaming
Our Gaming properties operate in highly competitive environments and primarily compete for customers with other casinos in the surrounding regional gaming markets. Our Gaming properties compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling, and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S.  
Human Capital 
We believe our human capital is material to our operations and core to the long-term success of the Company as an industry-leading racing, online wagering and gaming entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event, The Kentucky Derby. Our focus is on attracting innovative and collaborative team members who want to build their skills in a successful and growing set of businesses focused on creating unique experiences for our guests.
Our People
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of approximately 5,000 team members, of which 3,800 are full-time employees. As of December 31, 2021, the Live and Historical Racing segment had 1,200 team members, the TwinSpires segment had 300 team members; and the Gaming segment had 3,100 team members. Nearly one-quarter of the Live and Historical Racing segment team members are full-time employees and nearly all the TwinSpires and Gaming segment team members are full-time employees. The Company’s corporate staff consists of approximately 200 full-time employees. The number of seasonal employees fluctuates significantly through the course of the year primarily due to the seasonal nature of our businesses. We have the highest level of seasonal team members during the second quarter when we traditionally run the Kentucky Derby.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 550 full-time employees were covered by 18 collective bargaining agreements. We have experienced no material interruptions of operations due to disputes with our team members.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates a high-performance culture that leverages the unique perspectives of every team member to profitably grow our businesses. The Company’s Board of Directors and executive management team includes diverse individuals based on gender and race and benefit from the diverse experiences of our directors and management that individually and collectively create a high-performance culture focused on executing our strategic priorities to protect and grow our businesses effectively and efficiently. 
We believe diversity and inclusion helps the Company attract the best talent to grow our businesses and enables our businesses to attract and delight customers and consumers. The Kentucky Derby is a pillar of our community that provides the opportunity for our team members and the community to raise significant funding for charities that support important aspects of our broader communities including fostering diversity and inclusion, food, shelter, education, and health related non-profits. The Company also provides donations to non-profit organizations that support these initiatives within our communities. 
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
We invest in attracting, developing, and retaining our team members. Our philosophy is to communicate a clear purpose and strategy, set challenging goals, drive accountability, continuously assess, develop, and advance talent, and to embrace a leadership-driven talent strategy. Our Company enables team members to grow in their current roles as well as to have opportunities to build new skills in other parts of the Company. We review talent and succession plans with our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. The process focuses on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity in gender, race, and experience. 
Compensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness
We strive to offer market competitive salaries and wages for our team members and we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible employees. Our core health and welfare benefits are supplemented with specific programs to manage or improve common health conditions and to provide a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We also provide several innovative programs designed to promote physical, emotional, and financial well-being. Our commitment to the safety of our employees, customers, and community remains a top priority and we have safety programs at all our properties to facilitate identification and implementation of safety practices. 
Governmental Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes 
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations that affect our businesses. The ownership, operation and management of our Live and Historical Racing, TwinSpires, and Gaming segments, as well as our other operations, are subject to regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ownership, operation and management of our businesses and properties are also subject to legislative actions at both the federal and state level. 
Live and Historical Racing Regulations
Horse racing is a highly regulated industry. In the U.S., interstate pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing is subject to the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended in 2000 ("IHA"). Under the IHA, racetracks and ADWs can accept interstate off-track wagers if the racetracks and ADWs have approvals from (1) the host horse racetrack including a written agreement with the horsemen’s group, if applicable; (2) the host racing commission, and (3) the off-track racing commission. If these requirements are met, racetracks can commingle wagers from different racetracks and wagering facilities and broadcast horse racing events to other licensed establishments.
In the U.S., individual states control the operations of racetracks located within their respective jurisdictions with the intent to, among other things, protect the public from unfair and illegal gambling practices, generate tax revenue, license racetracks and operators and prevent organized crime from being involved in the industry. Although the specific form may vary, states that regulate horse racing generally do so through a horse racing commission or other gambling regulatory authority. In general, regulatory authorities perform background checks on all racetrack owners prior to granting the necessary operating licenses. Horse owners, trainers, jockeys, drivers, stewards, judges, and backstretch personnel are also subject to licensing by governmental authorities. State regulation of horse races extends to virtually every aspect of racing including the presence and placement of specific race officials such as timers, placing judges, starters, and patrol judges. 
The total number of days on which each racetrack conducts live racing fluctuates annually according to each calendar year and the determination of applicable regulatory authorities.
Kentucky
In Kentucky, horse racing racetracks and HRM facilities are subject to the licensing and regulation of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission ("KHRC"), which is responsible for overseeing horse racing and regulating the state equine industry and overseeing the annual licensing and operations of HRMs in Kentucky. Licenses to conduct live thoroughbred and standardbred racing meets, to participate in simulcasting, and to accept advance deposit wagers from Kentucky residents are approved annually by the KHRC based upon applications submitted by the racetracks in Kentucky. 
Derby City Gaming, Oak Grove, and Newport are subject to extensive state and local laws and to licensing and regulatory control by the KHRC. Changes in Kentucky laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of HRMs that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Kentucky HRM operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the KHRC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Florida
During the second quarter of 2021, the Florida Legislature passed a bill to decouple jai alai from gaming activities. Under this new law, jai alai facilities can operate slots and cardrooms without conducting jai alai games. The decoupling legislative action went into effect when the U.S. Department of the Interior approved the compact on August 6, 2021. This legislative action is expected to have a favorable impact on our business.
TwinSpires Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
TwinSpires is licensed in Oregon under a multi-jurisdictional simulcasting and interactive wagering totalisator hub license issued by the Oregon Racing Commission in accordance with Oregon law and the IHA. We also hold advance deposit wagering licenses in certain other states where appropriate. Changes in the form of new legislation or regulatory activity at the state or federal level could adversely impact our mobile and online ADW business.
Sports Betting and iGaming Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
In May 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had effectively banned sports wagering in most states. Removal of the ban gave states the authority to authorize sports wagering. Thirty-three states have authorized sports betting and thirty of these states have sports betting operational as of December 31, 2021. Each state has different structures for the number of allowable industry participants, license fees, taxes, and other operational requirements. 
As of December 31, 2021. the Company is operational in seven states for retail sports betting, seven states for online sports betting, and three states for iGaming. 
Gaming Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
The gaming industry is a highly regulated industry. In the U.S., gaming laws are generally designed to protect consumers and the viability and integrity of the industry. Gaming laws may also be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenue derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. Gaming laws require industry participants to:
•Ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations,
•Establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices,
•Establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures,
•Maintain effective controls over financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue,
•Maintain systems for reliable record keeping,
•File periodic reports with gaming regulators,
•Ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions, 
•Establish programs to promote responsible gambling and inform patrons of the availability of help for problem gambling, and
•Enforce minimum age requirements.
A state regulatory environment is established by statute and administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate:
•Adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes,
•Interpret and enforce gaming laws,
•Impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties,
•Review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding suitability or qualification for licensure,
•Grant licenses for participation in gaming operations,
•Collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations,
•Review and approve transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants, securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants, and
•Establish and collect fees and taxes.
Any change in the gaming laws or regulations of a jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on our gaming operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
Gaming laws require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from gaming authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable. Criteria used in determining whether to grant a license to conduct gaming operations, while varying between jurisdictions, generally include consideration of factors such as the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant; the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, including whether the operation is adequately capitalized in the state and exhibits the ability to maintain adequate insurance levels; the quality of the applicant’s gaming facilities; the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable state from the operation of the applicant’s gaming facility; the applicant’s practices with respect to minority hiring and training; and the effect on competition and general impact on the community.
In evaluating individual applicants, gaming authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates.
Many gaming jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate gaming facilities within the state and some states limit the number of licenses granted to any one gaming operator. Licenses under gaming laws are generally not transferable without approval. Licenses in most of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed. The failure to renew any of our licenses could have a material adverse impact on our gaming operations.
Gaming authorities may investigate any subsidiary engaged in gaming operations and may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Our officers, directors and certain key employees must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed, qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing for any cause that they deem reasonable. Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have the ability to deny a license, qualification or finding of suitability and have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If one or more gaming authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. Gaming authorities may also require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
In many jurisdictions, certain of our shareholders may be required to undergo a suitability investigation similar to that described above. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and may be required to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most gaming authorities, however, allow an "institutional investor" to apply for a waiver. 
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised it is required by gaming authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Any shareholder found unsuitable or denied a license and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our voting securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable gaming authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. We may be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a shareholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: 
(i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities, 
(ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person, 
(iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise, or 
(iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of said voting securities for cash at fair market value.
Violations of Gaming Laws
If we violate applicable gaming laws, our gaming licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by gaming authorities, and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. A supervisor or conservator can be appointed by gaming authorities to operate our gaming properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our gaming assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances, income generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable state or states. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. As a result, violations by us of applicable gaming laws could have a material adverse impact on our gaming operations.
Some jurisdictions prohibit certain types of political activity by a gaming licensee, officers, directors and key employees. A violation of such a prohibition may subject the offender to criminal and/or disciplinary action.
Reporting and Record-keeping Requirements
We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information that gaming authorities may require. Under federal law, we are required to record and submit detailed reports of currency transactions involving greater than $10,000 at our gaming facilities and racetracks as well as any suspicious activity that may occur at such facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines or cessation of operations. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. 
A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
Review and Approval of Transactions
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities. We may not make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of gaming authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. Gaming authorities may also require controlling shareholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
License Fees and Gaming Taxes
We pay substantial license fees and taxes in many jurisdictions in connection with our gaming operations which are computed in various ways depending on the type of gambling or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable with varying frequency. License fees and taxes are based upon such factors as a percentage of the gaming revenue received; the number of gambling devices and table games operated; or a one-time fee payable upon the initial receipt of license and fees in connection with the renewal of license. In some jurisdictions, casino tax rates are graduated such that the tax rates increase as gaming revenue increases. Tax rates are subject to change, sometimes with little notice, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our gaming operations.
Operational Requirements
In most jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our gaming operations. In certain states, we are required to give preference to local suppliers and include minority and women-owned businesses and organized labor in construction projects to the maximum extent practicable. We may be required to give employment preference to minorities, women and in-state residents in certain jurisdictions. Our ability to conduct certain types of games, introduce new games or move existing games within our facilities may be restricted or subject to regulatory review and approval. Some of our operations are subject to restrictions on the number of gaming positions we may have, and the maximum wagers allowed to be placed by our customers.
Other Specific State Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Louisiana
During the second quarter of 2021, the Louisiana State Legislature passed a bill that was signed by Governor Edwards to allow HRMs in off-track betting facilities with oversight from the Louisiana Gaming Commission. Fair Grounds anticipates adding up to 50 HRMs per facility or approximately 600 HRMs in total across 14 facilities under this new law in 2022.
Maryland
During the second quarter of 2021, the Maryland Gaming Control Board adopted statutory changes to allow Ocean Downs to build a hotel. The Company is evaluating the economics and potential timing of building a hotel at Ocean Downs which may have a positive impact on our Company.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ("CAFO") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm and sanitary water discharges. CAFO and other water discharge regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of these regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. We may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in 
the contamination were legal at the time the contamination occurred. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances may materially adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. The owner of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.
Marks and Internet Properties
We hold numerous state and federal service mark registrations on specific names and designs in various categories including the entertainment business, apparel, paper goods, printed matter, housewares and glass. We license the use of these service marks and derive revenue from such license agreements.
