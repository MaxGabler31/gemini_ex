Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a dedicated contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) that provides a comprehensive range of services from process development to current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) commercial manufacturing focused on biopharmaceutical products derived from mammalian cell culture. With 25 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins in batch, fed-batch and perfusion modes, our services include cGMP clinical and commercial product manufacturing, purification, bulk packaging, stability testing and regulatory submissions and support. We also provide a variety of process development services, including cell line development and optimization, cell culture and feed optimization, analytical methods development and product characterization.
 
We have experience in performing process development and manufacturing of biologics since 1993 in our Franklin biomanufacturing facility (“Franklin Facility”) located at our headquarters in Tustin, California. In March 2016, we expanded our manufacturing capacity through the commissioning of our Myford biomanufacturing facility (“Myford Facility”) which more than doubled our manufacturing capacity. The 42,000 square foot facility, which is our second biomanufacturing facility, includes multiple single-use bioreactors up to the 2,000-liter manufacturing scale. The Myford Facility was designed to accommodate a fully disposable biomanufacturing process for products in clinical development to commercial. The Myford Facility is located adjacent to our Franklin Facility.
 
Business Transition
 
In the fall of 2017, we announced our intent to cease our research and development activities and to transition our business to a dedicated CDMO, which we completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. As part of our transition efforts, we completed the following initiatives:

· | In August 2017, we instituted a number of strategic actions, including the reduction of our research and development workforce, designed to reduce costs and better position ourselves as a dedicated CDMO;

· | In September 2017, we named Roger J. Lias, Ph.D., who has more than 20 years of management experience in the biologics CDMO industry, as the president of our contract manufacturing subsidiary. Subsequently, in December 2017, we appointed Dr. Lias as our President and Chief Executive Officer as we transitioned to a dedicated CDMO;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In October and November 2017, we appointed a total of six new independent members to our board of directors, each of whom has relevant CDMO industry experience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In November 2017, we named Tracy Kinjerski as our Vice President of Business Operations, who will focus on executing new business development initiatives with the objective of growing our commercial customer base;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On January 5, 2018, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our corporate name to Avid Bioservices, Inc. and we adopted the new ticker symbol “CDMO” on The NASDAQ Capital Market to align with the new end-market focus and strategic positioning of our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By January 31, 2018, we classified our R84 technology as held for sale and abandoned our remaining research and development assets (including our intent to return the exosome technology back to the original licensor);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On February 12, 2018, we sold our phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeting program pursuant to an Asset Assignment and Purchase Agreement (as described in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On February 20, 2018 we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold 10,294,445 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $2.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $23,163,000 before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering related expenses of $1,669,000 (as described in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



During our transition, we established and began executing on the following near-term strategic objectives:
 

· | Expand existing customer relationships and diversify our customer base by securing additional customers to support our potential future revenue growth beyond fiscal year 2018. Since undertaking our transition to a dedicated CDMO in the fall of 2017, we have executed service agreements with 5 new customers, as well as expanded existing client programs and added additional projects from existing customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to invest in manufacturing facilities and infrastructure to maximize our facility utilization and support our clients’ clinical and commercial development and manufacturing requirements. We are currently in the process of expanding and optimizing our process development capabilities and laboratory space, which includes expanding our total available process development laboratory space to more than 6,000 square feet, upgrading the infrastructure and equipment within our existing process development laboratories, and implementing new state-of-the-art technologies and equipment designed to facilitate efficient, high-throughput development of innovative upstream and downstream manufacturing processes. We are strategically conducting this work in phases to avoid disruption to current customer programs, with the first new laboratories expected to be operational during the third quarter of calendar year 2018. In addition, on May 8, 2018, we announced the appointment of Magnus Schroeder, Ph.D., as Vice President of Process Sciences, further strengthening our Process Development department and senior executive management team. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Broaden our sales force by hiring sales representatives to execute our business development initiatives in key markets. For the first time, we have hired a business development lead on the east coast, who has more than 26 years of relevant industry experience, including a 22-year tenure with a global integrated solutions provider to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. This individual will play a key role in our new customer acquisition efforts in the eastern half of North America, while supporting our existing clients in the same territory. In addition, we recently hired a business development lead for the western half of North America. This individual brings more than 25 years of sales experience, of which 18 years include direct biologics CDMO experience.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to address the market for outsourced development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals derived from mammalian biologics due to the following factors:

· | Expertise in Mammalian Biologics: We believe that recent consolidation in the CDMO industry has resulted in a limited number of nimble, independent CDMOs with mammalian biologics development and manufacturing capabilities. The mammalian cell culture production method is highly suitable for manufacturing complex molecules and we believe the benefits of the mammalian cell culture production method have played a significant role in accelerating the proliferation of biologics therapies. We believe we are well positioned in the industry given our expertise in mammalian biologics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Broad Spectrum of Services to Support Customers from Early Stage Development to Commercial: We provide fully integrated and customized biomanufacturing services that support our clients from the early preclinical stage to commercial launch and supply. Pharmaceutical companies generally prefer to engage with CDMOs that are able to work with a product throughout its lifecycle and have long-standing track records of regulatory compliance and quality control. Our Process Development, cGMP Biomanufacturing, Project Management, Quality Systems and Quality Control are all supported by modern facilities designed to meet customer needs from early stage development to commercial supply. We further differentiate ourselves in the market as follows: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Customer-Centric Approach: We have an extensive track record of tailoring our development and manufacturing solutions to meet the specific demands of each of our customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Agile Manufacturing and Development: We strive to collaborate with our customers throughout the duration of their projects, enabling us to rapidly respond to evolving production requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Cost-Effective Solutions: Our single-use bioreactors and widespread use of other disposable technologies throughout the manufacturing cycle reduce facility space and the cost of manufacturing materials, enabling us to deliver economically viable processes and enhanced manufacturing efficiency for our customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Regulatory Track Record: Historically, developing the expertise to comply with stringent regulatory audits and validation requirements has been a challenge for both pharmaceutical companies and CDMOs, and can serve as a significant barrier to entry for many CDMOs, as facilities can take years to construct and properly validate. Pharmaceutical companies place a premium on working with CDMOs that can ensure a high degree of regulatory compliance, which decreases execution risk. We have a strong regulatory track record consisting of a 15-year inspection history with no significant impact on our business. In addition, between 2005 and 2017, we completed six successful pre-approval inspections. We also completed four U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) inspections between 2013 to the most recently completed inspection in early calendar year 2018, none of which resulted in any Form 483 observations by the FDA. Further, we have successfully complied with audits from large pharmaceutical companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modern and Optimized Infrastructure: As a result of the development of our Myford Facility (which we commissioned in March 2016), we have positioned our business to capitalize on increasing demand in the biologics manufacturing industry for modular cleanroom space and single-use bioreactors. Increasingly efficient manufacturing techniques with improved fundamental cell line productivity have led to higher yields, which allow manufacturers to meet customer demand while using less manufacturing capacity. These developments have driven demand among pharmaceutical companies for facilities that can match bioreactor size to smaller volume production runs. With single-use bioreactors from 200 to 2,000 liters, our Myford Facility is designed to provide our customers with the desired efficiency and flexibility.

· | Significant Manufacturing Experience and Seasoned Management Team with a Proven Track Record: We have 25 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, over 13 years of cGMP commercial manufacturing experience and over 10 years of experience with single-use technology. Our management team and board of directors have a deep understanding of the CDMO industry and have contributed their collective expertise to our transition to a dedicated CDMO.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Revenue Growth: Although we experienced a moderate decline in revenues for fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an unanticipated decline in demand from our two largest customers, over the prior seven fiscal years our CDMO business experienced significant revenue growth, increasing from gross revenue of $8.5 million in fiscal year 2011 to $57.6 million in fiscal year 2017.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we have a significant opportunity to drive organic growth by leveraging our strengths, broadening our capabilities, increasing our capacity and improving our market visibility. Further, our transition to a dedicated CDMO has allowed us to re-allocate resources previously utilized for our research and development activities and focus on the growth of our CDMO business.
 
We have taken and continue to take steps to diversify and expand our customer base and have developed marketing and sales strategies designed to drive new client acquisitions, while also continuing to leverage our existing relationships to pursue additional collaborations with our existing customers. We also continue to expand our process development capabilities in order to make our operations more attractive to emerging, mid-sized and large pharmaceutical companies. We also leased an additional 42,000 square feet of vacant warehouse space within the same building as our existing Myford Facility. The proximity of this space to our Myford Facility will allow us to utilize existing manufacturing and quality infrastructure that we believe should enhance our manufacturing efficiencies and reduce the overall cost and timeframe to construct a third biomanufacturing facility. This space should house a facility that can accommodate up to six additional 2,000-liter bioreactors. However, we currently do not expect to commence construction of the new facility until our manufacturing capacity at our existing facilities is close to full utilization or we determine that we require additional capacity to meet specific customer demand.
 
Our Facilities
 
Our 12,000 square-foot Franklin Facility includes stainless steel bioreactors (100-liter to 1,000-liter) and single-use bioreactors (200-liter to 1,000-liter), water-for-injection, an autoclave and depyrogenation oven, material storage (including a walk-in cold room) and cell bank cryofreezers. The Franklin Facility is located at our headquarters in Tustin, California.
 
Our 42,000 square-foot Myford Facility is designed to utilize single-use equipment up to the 2,000-liter manufacturing scale to accommodate a fully disposable biomanufacturing process for products from clinical development to commercial supply. Our Myford Facility includes single-use bioreactors (200-liter to 2,000-liter), quality control labs for environmental and analytical testing, warehousing and material storage (including two walk-in cold rooms) and cell bank cyrofreezers. The Myford Facility is located adjacent to our Franklin Facility.
 
Our Capabilities
 
We provide a wide range of development and manufacturing services that span the product lifecycle from discovery and preclinical stages to commercialization and are continuously monitoring our processes in order to increase efficiency. We provide a wide range of development and scale-up services for our clients, including cell line development and selection of clones, upstream and downstream process development, regulatory support including investigational new drug application-ready chemistry, manufacturing, and control (“CMC”) submission package and assay development and testing. We also provide a wide range of cGMP clinical and commercial biomanufacturing services, including characterization assay development, regulatory support, comparability studies, second source supply, process characterization, analytical method validation, supporting the final Biologics License Application CMC package and commercial launch for global markets.
 
We differentiate our capabilities through several key criteria: (i) we employ a customer-centric approach and collaborate with our clients to tailor customized development and manufacturing services; (ii) our agile manufacturing and development capabilities allow for rapid responses to shift production requirements, leading to strong client satisfaction and retention; and (iii) our usage of single-use bioreactors contributes to enhanced manufacturing efficiency for our customers.

We have a strong and proven regulatory track record, including 15 years of inspection history with no significant impact to our business. To date, we have been audited and qualified by large and small and domestic and foreign biotechnology companies interested in the production of biologic material for clinical and commercial use. Additionally, we have been audited by several regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (“ANVISA”), the Canadian Health Authority (“Health Canada”), the California Department of Health and the Australian Department of Health.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
We manufacture cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products for our customers. The process for manufacturing generally uses commercially available raw materials from multiple suppliers, and in some instances, from a single source supplier. We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA’s quality system regulation, cGMPs or other applicable laws or regulations, we would be required to find alternative suppliers. If our primary suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform, any resulting delays or interruptions in the supply of raw materials required to support our manufacturing of cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products would ultimately delay our manufacture of products for our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. To date, however, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials.
Regulatory Matters
 
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions, such as the EMA, ANVISA, Health Canada, and the Australian Department of Health, depending on the countries in which our customers market and sell the products we manufacture and/or package on their behalf. We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed in “Environmental and Safety Matters" below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers' products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization.
 
Our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. In addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations.
 
Environmental and Safety Matters
 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 
Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.

Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently own any patents and do not have any patent applications pending in the United States or any foreign countries. However, we have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise (“know-how”) and trade secrets in the provision of process development and manufacturing services. Our know-how and trade secrets may not be patentable, but they are valuable in that they enhance our ability to provide high-quality services to our customers. We typically place restrictions in our agreements with third-parties, which contractually restrict their right to use and disclose any of our proprietary technology with which they may be involved. In addition, we have internal non-disclosure safeguards, including confidentiality agreements, with our employees.
 
We also own trademarks to protect the names of our services. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.
 
Segment Information
 
Historically, our business had been organized into two reportable operating segments: (i) our research and development segment, and (ii) our contract manufacturing services segment. However, due to the aforementioned changes in our organizational structure, which resulted in our research and development segment meeting all the conditions required in order to be classified as a discontinued operation (as described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), management has determined that we now operate in one operating segment with one reporting segment. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the operations and related assets and liabilities of our discontinued research and development segment as a discontinued operation. In addition, we had no foreign-based operations and no long-lived assets located in foreign countries as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Customers
 
Contract manufacturing revenue has historically been derived from a small customer base. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, we derived approximately 98% of our contract manufacturing revenue from six customers and three customers, respectively, and for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, we derived approximately 95% of our contract manufacturing revenue from two customers. While we have not entered into long-term commitments with our customers historically, we have begun to increase our effort to obtain longer-term commitments from our customers. As such, the duration of our fulfillment of customer contracts varies from a few months to more than 24 months due to the nature and size of each customer’s requirements. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from any one of our primary customers is significantly reduced or eliminated. Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our customer concentration, including the name of significant customers, and geographic location of customers.
Backlog
 
Our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future contract manufacturing revenue from work not yet completed under signed contracts. As of April 30, 2018, our backlog was approximately $57.8 million as compared to approximately $57.7 million as of April 30, 2017. While we anticipate the majority of our backlog will be recognized during fiscal year 2019, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk that a customer timely cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of manufacturing services, in which case we may be required to refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; the risk that a customer may experience delays in its program (s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated manufacturing services; and the risk that we may not successfully execute on all customer projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenue.
Competition
 
Our competition in the CDMO market includes a number of full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Also, large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.
