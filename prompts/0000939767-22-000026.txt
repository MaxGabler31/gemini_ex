Item 1. Business
Overview 
Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis, we, our or us) is an oncology-focused biotechnology company that strives to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. Using our considerable drug discovery, development and commercialization resources and capabilities, we have invented and brought to market innovative therapies that appropriately balance patient benefits and risks; we will continue to build on this foundation as we strive to provide cancer patients with new treatment options that improve upon current standards of care. 
Today, four products that originated in Exelixis laboratories are available to be prescribed to patients. Sales related to our flagship molecule, cabozantinib, account for the large majority of our revenues. Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors and RET and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in 61 other countries as: CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib) tablets approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), both alone and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMS) OPDIVO® (nivolumab), for previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, currently by the FDA, for previously treated, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC); and COMETRIQ® (cabozantinib) capsules approved for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). For physicians treating these types of cancer, cabozantinib has become or is becoming an important drug in their selection of effective therapies.
The other two products resulting from our discovery efforts are: COTELLIC® (cobimetinib), an inhibitor of MEK approved as part of multiple combination regimens to treat specific forms of advanced melanoma and marketed under a collaboration with Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group) (Genentech); and MINNEBRO® (esaxerenone), an oral, non-steroidal, selective blocker of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) approved for the treatment of hypertension in Japan and licensed to Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo). For additional information about these products, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Other Collaborations.”
The year 2021 was our fifth year of profitability. Our total revenues grew by approximately 45% as a result of markedly increased sales of our cabozantinib products by our commercial organization in the U.S. and increased royalties and milestones earned pursuant to collaboration agreements with our ex-U.S. partners. Our plan is to utilize our operating cash flows and cash and investments to expand the cabozantinib franchise by potentially adding new indications in areas of unmet medical need. We will also leverage our operating cash flows to continue advancing our diverse small molecule and 
biotherapeutics programs, exploring multiple modalities and mechanisms of action to discover new oncology drugs. So far, these drug discovery and preclinical activities have resulted in four clinical-stage compounds: XL092, a next-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); XB002, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that targets tissue factor (TF); XL102, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7); and XL114, a novel anti-cancer compound that inhibits the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex.

Outside the U.S., we rely on collaboration partners for the commercialization of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ; Ipsen Pharma SAS (Ipsen) is responsible for all territories outside of the U.S. and Japan, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) is responsible for the Japanese market. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we earned $105.2 million, $78.4 million and $62.4 million, respectively, of royalties on net sales of cabozantinib products outside of the U.S. For additional information on the terms of our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Cabozantinib Commercial Collaborations.”
Renal Cell Carcinoma - CABOMETYX is a Leading TKI Treatment Option for Patients with Advanced RCC
CABOMETYX has become a standard of care for the treatment of patients suffering from advanced RCC, and a growing number of these patients have been or will be treated with CABOMETYX. Kidney cancer is among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S. Estimates suggest that approximately 33,000 patients in the U.S. and over 71,000 worldwide will require systemic treatment for kidney cancer in 2022, with over 15,000 patients in need of a first-line treatment in the U.S.
Since CABOMETYX was first approved, we have deployed our promotional and medical affairs teams to educate physicians about CABOMETYX, and we believe that the product’s success is attributable to the strength of the clinical data reflected in its FDA-approved labeling for advanced RCC. The CABOMETYX label incorporates the results of the METEOR, CABOSUN and CheckMate -9ER clinical trials. In July 2015, we announced positive results of METEOR, a phase 3 pivotal trial comparing CABOMETYX to everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGF receptor inhibitor. These results formed the basis for the FDA’s approval in April 2016, following which CABOMETYX became the first and only single-agent therapy approved in the U.S. for previously treated advanced RCC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in three key efficacy parameters in a global pivotal trial: overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS); and objective response rate (ORR). Subsequently, in October 2016, we announced positive results from CABOSUN, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 2 trial conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, comparing cabozantinib with sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. These results formed the basis for the FDA’s approval in December 2017 of CABOMETYX for previously untreated patients with advanced RCC, and for this patient population, CABOMETYX is the only approved single-agent therapy to demonstrate improved PFS compared with sunitinib, a first-generation TKI that was the previous standard of care.
CABOMETYX has also demonstrated positive clinical results in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), most notably in CheckMate -9ER, an open-label, randomized, multinational phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating OPDIVO, an ICI developed by BMS, in combination with CABOMETYX versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. Results from CheckMate -9ER demonstrated that the combination of CABOMETYX and OPDIVO doubled PFS and ORR and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% compared with sunitinib, and formed the basis for the FDA’s approval of the combination in January 2021 as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the nation’s foremost non-profit alliance of leading cancer centers, has included the combination of CABOMETYX with OPDIVO in its Clinical Practice Guidelines for Kidney Cancer as a Category 1 option for the first-line treatment of patients with clear cell RCC. The NCCN also lists single-agent CABOMETYX as a category 1 preferred regimen in subsequent treatments for patients with clear cell RCC, and as a preferred systemic therapy regimen for non-clear cell RCC, supporting CABOMETYX’s position in the RCC treatment landscape.
In markets outside the U.S. in 2021, we continued to work closely with our collaboration partner Ipsen in support of its regulatory strategy and commercialization efforts for CABOMETYX as a treatment for advanced RCC, both as a single 
agent and in combination with OPDIVO, as well as in preparation for submission of applications for approvals of CABOMETYX in combination with other therapies, and similarly with our collaboration partner Takeda with respect to the Japanese market. As a result of the approvals of CABOMETYX and/or the combination of CABOMETYX with OPDIVO for RCC indications in 61 countries outside of the U.S., including the Member States of the EU, Japan, the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, CABOMETYX has continued to grow markedly outside the U.S. both in sales revenue and the number of RCC patients benefiting from its clinical effect. 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma - CABOMETYX Offers an Important Alternative for Patients with Previously Treated HCC
According to published studies, liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more than 800,000 deaths and 900,000 new cases each year. Although HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, making up about three-fourths of the more than 41,000 cases of liver cancer estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. during 2022, this patient population has long been underserved. Prior to 2017, there was only one approved systemic therapy for the treatment of HCC. Since that time, multiple new therapies were approved in the U.S. for HCC, both for previously untreated patients and for patients previously treated with sorafenib. Given the introduction of new and demonstrably more effective therapies, including ICI combination therapies, we believe the second- and later-line market for HCC therapies has the potential to grow significantly in coming years, as these new treatment options are expected to improve longer-term outcomes, thereby resulting in a greater number of patients receiving multiple lines of therapy. With the approval of CABOMETYX in January 2019 for HCC patients previously treated with sorafenib, we expect to continue to play a key role in the treatment landscape for these patients.
The FDA’s approval of CABOMETYX’s HCC indication was based on our phase 3 pivotal study, CELESTIAL. The CELESTIAL study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that cabozantinib significantly improved OS, as compared to placebo. The NCCN has included CABOMETYX in its Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hepatobiliary Cancers as a Category 1 option for the treatment of patients with HCC (Child-Pugh Class A only) who have been previously treated with sorafenib, providing further support for CABOMETYX as an important treatment option for eligible HCC patients.
Outside the U.S., the EC’s approval of CABOMETYX provided physicians in the EU with a second approved therapy for the second-line treatment of this aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancer, and approvals from Health Canada and the Japanese MHLW brought a much-needed therapy to HCC patients in those countries. In addition to the Member States of the EU, Japan, the U.K. and Canada, CABOMETYX is also approved for previously treated HCC indications in Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong, among other countries.
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer - a New Opportunity for CABOMETYX to Help an Underserved Patient Population 
Published studies indicate that approximately 44,000 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022. Differentiated thyroid tumors, which make up about 90% of all thyroid cancers, are typically treated with surgery followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid with radioiodine (RAI). Approximately 5% to 15% of differentiated thyroid tumors are resistant to RAI treatment. With limited treatment options, these patients have a life expectancy of only three to six years from the time metastatic lesions are detected. New treatment options are therefore urgently needed. In December 2020, we announced that COSMIC-311, our phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in patients with RAI-refractory DTC who have progressed after up to two prior VEGF receptor-targeted therapies, met its co-primary endpoint of demonstrating significant improvement in PFS as compared with placebo. These results formed the basis for the FDA’s approval in September 2021 of CABOMETYX for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior VEGF receptor-targeted therapy and who are RAI-refractory or ineligible. We commenced the commercial launch of CABOMETYX in this patient group upon the FDA’s approval, and we have seen a strong uptake in prescriptions for CABOMETYX in previously treated DTC during the months that followed.
Outside the U.S., our collaboration partner Ipsen submitted a variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated, RAI-refractory DTC, with the EMA validating the variation application and beginning its centralized review process in August 2021.
Medullary Thyroid Cancer - COMETRIQ, the First Commercial Approval of Cabozantinib
Estimates suggest that there will be approximately 940 MTC cases diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022, and COMETRIQ has served as an important treatment option for these patients since January 2013. The FDA’s approval of COMETRIQ for progressive, metastatic MTC was based on our phase 3 trial, EXAM. The EXAM trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation in PFS for cabozantinib, as compared to placebo. In connection with the approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we were subject to post-marketing requirements, including a requirement to conduct the EXAMINER clinical study, comparing a lower 60mg dose of cabozantinib with the labeled dose of 140 mg. Although EXAMINER did not meet the prespecified statistical noninferiority criterion for PFS (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1. as assessed by independent review) in the cabozantinib 60 mg arm compared with the 140 mg arm, it provided another rich data set of cabozantinib experience in MTC. In the meantime, we will continue to market COMETRIQ capsules for MTC patients at the labeled dose of 140 mg.
Exelixis Development Programs
We have extensive expertise in the clinical development of oncology products, which we leverage when exploring additional clinical uses of cabozantinib in combination with other therapies and advancing that effort to new regulatory approvals. Those activities comprise the broad cabozantinib development program described below. In addition, we also apply that expertise to advancing our company’s next generation of cancer treatments: new, innovative therapies that have the potential to help future cancer patients recover stronger and live longer. Accordingly, we are initiating clinical studies for our small molecule drug candidates—XL092, XL102 and XL114—as well as for our first biotherapeutics product candidate, XB002, and these activities are described under “—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates.”
A summary of our cabozantinib and other development programs is provided below.
Cabozantinib Development Program
Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. Objective tumor responses have been observed in patients treated with cabozantinib in multiple individual tumor types investigated in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials to date, reflecting the medicine’s broad clinical potential. We continue to evaluate cabozantinib, both as a single agent and in combination with ICIs, in a broad development program comprising over 100 ongoing or planned clinical trials across multiple tumor types. We, along with our collaboration partners, sponsor some of those trials, and independent investigators conduct the remaining trials through our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (NCI-CTEP) or our investigator sponsored trial (IST) program. In addition to co-funding select trials with us, our collaboration partners Ipsen and Takeda also conduct trials in their respective territories through similar independently-sponsored programs.
The following two tables summarize select cabozantinib clinical development activities, one describing studies that evaluate the potential of cabozantinib as a single-agent, and the other describing studies that evaluate the potential of cabozantinib in combination with other therapies, including ICIs:

Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements
We continue to invest significantly in the exploration of additional clinical uses of cabozantinib in combination with other therapies. In particular, given that clinical observations from clinical trials evaluating cabozantinib in combination with ICIs have shown promising activity across a diverse range of tumors, and that patients have been able to tolerate these drug combinations, we are focused on the potential of cabozantinib in combination with ICIs in additional late-stage or other potentially label-enabling trials. 
Combination Studies with BMS
In February 2017, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of conducting clinical studies combining cabozantinib with BMS’ PD-1 ICI, nivolumab, both with or without BMS’ CTLA-4 ICI, ipilimumab. Based on the data from CheckMate -9ER, the first clinical trial conducted under this collaboration, the FDA approved CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO on January 22, 2021 as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC. We continue to evaluate these combinations in COSMIC-313, a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated advanced RCC. Pursuant to our agreements with BMS, each party is responsible for supplying finished drug product for the applicable clinical trial, and responsibility for the payment of costs for each trial is determined on a trial-by-trial basis. For additional information on the terms of the clinical trial collaboration agreement, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Cabozantinib Development Collaborations—BMS.”
RCC - COSMIC-313. In May 2019, we initiated COSMIC-313, a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab versus the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced intermediate- or poor-risk RCC. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab or to the control arm of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with matched placebo. The primary endpoint for the trial is PFS, and secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. Based on long-term follow-up results for CheckMate 214, in which the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed a longer median OS compared to original assumptions, we expanded the enrollment target for COSMIC-313 to provide additional power to assess the secondary endpoint of OS for COSMIC-313. We completed the expanded enrollment of 855 patients in March 2021 and expect to report top-line results of the event-driven analyses from the trial in the first half of 2022. We are sponsoring COSMIC-313, and BMS is providing nivolumab and ipilimumab for the study free of charge.
Combination Studies with Roche
Diversifying our exploration of cabozantinib combinations with ICIs, in February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and Roche’s anti-PD-L1 ICI, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. As part of the clinical supply agreement, we are evaluating this combination in a phase 1b trial in locally advanced or metastatic tumors, COSMIC-021, and a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated advanced HCC. Informed by the data generated from COSMIC-021, we also entered into a joint clinical research agreement with Roche in December 2019, pursuant to which we are evaluating this combination in three late-stage clinical trials: the first, CONTACT-01, focuses on patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy; the second, CONTACT-02, focuses on patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy (NHT); and the third, CONTACT-03, focuses on patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC who have progressed during or following treatment with an ICI as the immediate preceding therapy. For additional information on the terms of the joint clinical research agreement, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Cabozantinib Development Collaborations—Roche.”
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors - COSMIC-021. In June 2017, we initiated COSMIC-021, a phase 1b dose escalation study that is evaluating the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in combination with Roche’s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We are the trial sponsor of COSMIC-021, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. The study is divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase, which was completed in 2018; and an expansion cohort phase, which is ongoing. 
Enrollment in the expansion phase of this study includes 20 combination therapy tumor expansion cohorts in NSCLC, mCRPC, RCC and various other tumor types. Encouraging efficacy and safety data has emerged from the trial and has been instrumental in guiding our clinical development strategy for cabozantinib in combination with ICIs, including supporting the initiation of COSMIC-312, CONTACT-01, CONTACT-02 and CONTACT-03. Moreover, certain cohorts have been expanded, including a cohort of patients with mCRPC who have been previously treated with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue (Cohort 6) and a cohort of patients with NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI. Data from Cohort 6, announced in May 2021 and presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2021 Congress in September 2021, resulted in an investigator assessed ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 23% and a blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC) assessed ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 15%. Other more detailed results from Cohort 6 were also presented at the ESMO 2021 Congress, including investigator assessed PFS per RECIST v. 1.1 of 5.5 months and BIRC assessed PFS per RECIST v. 1.1 of 5.7 months. While these results show promise, following discussions with the FDA, we will not pursue a regulatory submission for the combination regimen based 
solely on the Cohort 6 results; however, we will continue to evaluate the combination regimen in patients with previously treated mCRPC in the CONTACT-02 phase 3 pivotal trial. 
HCC - COSMIC-312. In December 2018, we initiated COSMIC-312, a multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in previously untreated advanced HCC. The trial also includes a third arm evaluating cabozantinib monotherapy in this first-line setting in order to address the contribution of components for the combination therapy. We are sponsoring COSMIC-312, and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. Ipsen will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. and Japan. Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. In August 2020, we announced the completion of patient enrollment in COSMIC-312, providing the requisite patient population to conduct the event-driven analyses of the trial’s two primary endpoints of PFS and OS. Separately, patient enrollment remains open in mainland China in order to enroll a sufficient number of patients to enable local registration, if supported by the clinical data. Patients are being randomized to one of three arms: cabozantinib (40 mg) in combination with atezolizumab; sorafenib; or cabozantinib monotherapy (60 mg). In June and November 2021, we announced results from COSMIC-312, which were presented at the ESMO Asia Virtual Oncology Week in November 2021. The trial met one of the primary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvement in BIRC assessed PFS at the planned primary analysis, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 37% compared with sorafenib (hazard ration [HR]: 0.63; 99% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.91; P=0.0012; pre-specified critical P-value of 0.01). Median PFS was 6.8 months for cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus 4.2 months for sorafenib. The interim OS analysis performed at the same time did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.90; 96% CI: 0.69-1.18; P=0.438). Median OS was 15.4 months for cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus 15.5 months for sorafenib. The trial is continuing as planned to the final analysis of OS, anticipated during the first quarter of 2022, and we intend to submit an sNDA to the FDA for the combination regimen if supported by the final OS analysis.
NSCLC - CONTACT-01. Lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 236,000 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2022. The disease is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women, causing 25% of all cancer-related deaths. The majority (84%) of lung cancer cases are NSCLC, which mainly comprise adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. The five-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC is 25%, but that rate falls to just 7% for those with advanced or metastatic disease. Due to the urgent need for treatment options for patients with NSCLC and based on positive early-stage results from COSMIC-021, in June 2020, we and Roche initiated CONTACT-01, a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients are randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab or to the control arm of docetaxel. The primary endpoint for the trial is OS, and secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and DOR, in each case per RECIST v. 1.1. In November 2021, we announced the completion of enrollment of 366 patients at 117 sites globally. Based on current event rates, we anticipate announcing results of the interim OS analysis in the second half of 2022. CONTACT-01 is sponsored by Roche and co-funded by us. In addition, both Ipsen and Takeda have opted into and are co-funding the trial, and both companies will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions in their respective territories outside of the U.S. 
mCRPC - CONTACT-02. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2022, approximately 268,500 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed, and 34,500 people will die from the disease. Prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies—a common treatment for prostate cancer—is known as mCRPC. Researchers estimate that in 2020, 43,000 men were diagnosed with mCRPC, which has a median survival of less than two years. In response to this significant unmet need and based on positive early-stage results from Cohort 6 of COSMIC-021, in June 2020, we and Roche initiated CONTACT-02, a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with mCRPC who have been previously treated with one NHT. The trial aims to enroll approximately 580 patients at approximately 280 sites globally, and we expect to complete enrollment in the second half of 2022. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab or to the control arm of a second NHT (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The two primary endpoints for the trial are PFS per RECIST v. 1.1 as assessed by BIRC and OS, and secondary endpoints include ORR, prostate-specific antigen response rate and DOR. CONTACT-02 is sponsored by us and co-funded by Roche. In addition, both Ipsen and Takeda have opted into and are co-funding the trial, and both companies will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions in their respective territories outside of the U.S.
RCC - CONTACT-03. Taking into account the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for RCC and based on positive early-stage results from COSMIC-021, in July 2020, we and Roche initiated CONTACT-03, a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus cabozantinib alone in 
patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC who progressed during or following treatment with an ICI as the immediate preceding therapy. Patients are randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab or to the control arm of cabozantinib alone. The two primary endpoints for the trial are PFS per RECIST v. 1.1 as assessed by BIRC and OS, and secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and DOR as assessed by the investigators. CONTACT-03 is sponsored by Roche and co-funded by us. In addition, both Ipsen and Takeda have the right to opt in and co-fund the trial and if doing so, they will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions in their respective territories outside of the U.S. In January 2022, we announced the completion of enrollment of 523 patients at 168 sites globally. Based on current event rates, we anticipate announcing results of PFS and the first interim OS analysis in the second half of 2022. We intend to use the data from CONTACT-03 to further study the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in this patient population, both as a single agent and in combination with ICIs.
Other Trials Evaluating Cabozantinib in Combination with other Therapies
RCC - CANTATA: In January 2021 Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (Calithera) announced that the CANTATA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improving PFS per independent review for Calithera’s teleaglenastat (also known as CB-839) plus cabozantinib as compared with cabozantinib alone in previously treated advanced or metastatic RCC. The HR was 0.94 (p=0.65), and median PFS was 9.2 months among patients treated with telaglenastat and cabozantinib as compared to 9.3 months for patients treated with cabozantinib and placebo. We provided cabozantinib for the trial through a material supply agreement with Calithera.
Trials Conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST Program
In October 2011, we entered into a CRADA with NCI-CTEP for the clinical development of cabozantinib. The CRADA and our IST program have enabled further expansion of the cabozantinib development program with less burden on our internal development resources. This CRADA reflects a major commitment by NCI-CTEP to support the broad exploration of cabozantinib’s potential in a wide variety of cancers, each representing a substantial unmet medical need. Through this mechanism, NCI-CTEP provides funding for as many as 20 active clinical trials of cabozantinib each year for a five-year period. We and NCI-CTEP have extended the term of the CRADA through October 2026, provided that both parties maintain the right to terminate the CRADA for any reason upon sixty days’ notice, for an uncured material breach upon thirty days’ notice and immediately for safety concerns. Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for trials under the CRADA are held by NCI-CTEP. NCI-CTEP also retains rights to any inventions made in whole or in part by NCI-CTEP investigators. However, for inventions that claim the use and/or the composition of cabozantinib, we have an automatic option to elect a worldwide, non-exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions for commercial purposes, with the right to sublicense to affiliates or collaborators working on our behalf, as well as an additional, separate option to negotiate an exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions. Further, before any trial proposed under the CRADA may commence, the protocol is subject to our review and approval, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. As reflected by the results from completed trials and given the numerous ongoing and planned clinical trials, we believe our CRADA with NCI-CTEP has and will enable us to continue to expand the cabozantinib development program broadly in a cost-efficient manner. A summary of key trials under this collaboration is provided below.
Advanced Genitourinary Tumors
PDIGREE is a phase 3 trial led by The Alliance that is enrolling 1,046 intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC patients who have a clear cell component in their tumors. All patients are initially treated with up to 4 cycles of induction ipilimumab combined with nivolumab. Subsequently, patients are treated based on their response to the induction therapy. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) continue on maintenance nivolumab, while patients with progressive disease (PD) are switched to cabozantinib monotherapy. Patients who neither achieve a CR nor develop PD during induction are randomized 1:1 to either maintenance nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib 40 mg daily. The primary endpoint is OS, while PFS, CR rate, ORR and safety are among the secondary endpoints.
In February 2021, positive initial results were announced from PAPMET (also known as SWOG S1500), a randomized phase 2 trial conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group evaluating cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with metastatic papillary RCC. PAPMET met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation of PFS, with a median PFS of 9.0 months for cabozantinib (95% CI: 6-12) versus 5.6 months for sunitinib (95% CI: 3-7) (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.37-0.97; P=0.019). Detailed results from PAPMET were presented at the virtual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2021 and published in The Lancet.
RADICAL is a randomized phase 2 trial being conducted by The Alliance that plans to enroll up to 210 patients with advanced RCC. All patients must have at least 2 sites of bone metastases and may have received up to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Patients are randomized 1:1 to be treated with cabozantinib in combination with radium-223 dichloride or cabozantinib as a single agent. The primary endpoint is symptomatic skeletal event-free survival, while secondary endpoints include PFS, OS, ORR and safety.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
The Alliance is leading the CABINET study that treats patients with well- or moderately-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). CABINET includes 2 separate randomized studies, one for patients with pancreatic NETs and the other for patients with carcinoid tumors. The planned enrollment for the pancreatic NET study is 185 patients and for the carcinoid study is 210 patients. Both studies randomize previously treated patients 2:1 to cabozantinib 60 mg daily or placebo. The primary endpoint for both studies is PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 as determined by a blinded IRRC. 
Other Cancer Indications
Overall, there are 66 ongoing and 26 planned externally sponsored trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib, including those administered through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program. Like our CRADA with NCI-CTEP, our IST program helps us to continue to evaluate cabozantinib across a broad range of tumor types.
These externally sponsored trials include signal seeking studies of single-agent cabozantinib, novel combinations, and randomized trials. The monotherapy trials are focused on solid tumors including genitourinary neoplasms, gastrointestinal malignancies, lung cancer and a variety of less common tumor types. The combination studies include trials combining cabozantinib with several different ICIs, as well as studies adding cabozantinib to various other anti-cancer therapies, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), chemotherapeutic agents, small molecules which target specific cellular pathways, or radiation. In addition to the various trials described above, our CRADA includes an ongoing randomized phase 2 study in NSCLC, also in combination with an ICI.
A complete listing of all ongoing cabozantinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates
We have advanced several other product candidates into clinical trials during recent years, including both small molecules and biotherapeutics that we have discovered or in-licensed and believe may have the potential to benefit patients with a variety of cancers. The following table summarizes our current and planned clinical development activities outside of the cabozantinib franchise:

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR PIPELINE
Product | Mechanism of Action | Setting | Status Update 
XL092 | Next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting MET/VEGFR/AXL/MER | Advanced or metastatic solid tumors | Phase 1b trials evaluating single-agent and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)combination regimens ongoing •In combination with atezolizumab and with avelumab (STELLAR-001)•In combination with nivolumab, with nivolumab and ipilimumab and with nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (STELLAR-002) Potential to initiate late-stage trials in 2022 (including STELLAR-303) 


XB002 | Next-generation tissue factor (TF)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) | Advanced solid tumors | Phase 1 trial evaluating single-agent ongoing Potential to add combination regimens with ICIs and other targeted therapies in 2022 
XL102 | Potent, selective, orally bioavailable cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor | Advanced or metastatic solid tumors | Phase 1 trial evaluating single-agentand combination regimens ongoing•In combination with fulvestrant, with abiraterone and prednisone and potentially with other anti-cancer regimens
XL114 | CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex inhibitor | Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) | Phase 1 trial evaluating single-agent planned for first half of 2022 

XL092 Development Program
The first compound discovered at Exelixis to enter the clinic following our re-initiation of drug discovery activities in 2017 was XL092, a next-generation oral TKI that targets VEGF receptors, MET, AXL, MER and other kinases implicated in cancer’s growth and spread. In designing XL092, we sought to build upon our experience with cabozantinib, retaining a similar target profile while improving key characteristics, including the pharmacokinetic half-life. We are evaluating XL092 in a growing clinical development program across various tumor types.
Advanced Solid Tumors - STELLAR-001. Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND for XL092, in February 2019, we initiated STELLAR-001, a multicenter phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XL092. STELLAR-001 is divided into dose-escalation and expansion phases. In October 2020, we presented data at the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium that suggest XL092 has a desirable therapeutic profile. We believe it pairs the potential for significant anti-tumor activity with a much shorter clinical pharmacokinetic half-life than cabozantinib, and also presents the potential for synergistic effects in combination with ICIs. In consideration of these data, we amended the phase 1 study protocol in October 2020 to include dose-escalation and expansion cohorts for XL092 in combination with atezolizumab, and again in March 2021 to include dose-escalation and expansion cohorts for XL092 in combination avelumab, an ICI developed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA) and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer). We are continuing to enroll patients into the dose-escalation cohorts of the combination part of the trial, and we expect that once recommended doses are established for single-agent XL092, XL092 in combination with atezolizumab and XL092 in combination with avelumab, the trial will begin to enroll expansion cohorts for patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC, colorectal cancer (CRC), hormone-receptor positive breast cancer mCRPC and urothelial carcinoma (UC). The primary efficacy endpoints for the expansion phase may include ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 and PFS per RECIST v. 1.1.
Advanced Solid Tumors - STELLAR-002. In December 2021, we initiated STELLAR-002, a multicenter phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of XL092 in combination with either nivolumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab, or nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin, an investigational CD122-preferential IL-2–pathway agonist developed by Nektar Therapeutics (Nektar). STELLAR-002 is divided into dose-escalation and expansion phases. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors and will determine the recommended dose in patients for each of the XL092 combination regimens. Depending on the dose-escalation results, STELLAR-002 may enroll expansion cohorts for patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC, mCRPC and UC. The primary efficacy endpoint of the expansion phase will be ORR, except for the cohort of patients with mCRPC, for which the primary efficacy endpoint will be duration of radiographic PFS. To better understand the individual contribution of the therapies, treatment arms in the expansion cohorts may include XL092 as a single agent in addition to the ICI combination regimens.
In addition to clinical updates for XL092 expected in 2022, we plan to initiate the first global phase 3 pivotal trial for the compound in the first half of the year, and other pivotal trials may follow throughout the year. This first planned trial, STELLAR-303, will evaluate XL092 in combination with atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with metastatic microsatellite stable CRC who have progressed after or are intolerant to the current standard of care. Preclinical data and emerging results from STELLAR-001 for XL092, both alone and in combination with ICIs, reinforce our belief in the 
opportunity for XL092, which pairs a target profile similar to cabozantinib with a potentially significantly improved safety profile. The decision to initiate STELLAR-303 is also supported by data from a CRC cohort of COSMIC-021, our phase 1b study evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab, and from CAMILLA, a phase 1 IST evaluating cabozantinib in combination with durvalumab or with durvalumab and tremelimumab. Results from both of these trials were presented at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January 2022. We intend to develop XL092 in novel combination regimens in a broad array of future potential indications where cabozantinib has demonstrated RECIST v. 1.1 anti-tumor activity.
XB002 Development Program
XB002 (formerly ICON-2) is our lead TF-targeting ADC program, which we in-licensed from Iconic, Inc. (Iconic). XB002 is an ADC composed of human mAb against TF that is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. TF is highly expressed on tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment, and TF overexpression, while not oncogenic itself, facilitates angiogenesis, metastasis and other processes important to tumor development and progression. After binding to TF on tumor cells, XB002 is internalized, and the cytotoxic agent is released, resulting in targeted tumor cell death. XB002 is a rationally designed next-generation ADC that leverages proprietary linker-payload technology. Based on promising preclinical data, we exercised our exclusive option to license XB002 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development of XB002. For additional information on our business development activities with Iconic, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Research Collaborations, In-licensing Arrangements and Other Business Development Activities—Iconic.” Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND for XB002, in June 2021, we initiated a multicenter phase 1, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial is divided into dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phases. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, with the primary objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose levels for intravenous infusion of XB002 as a single agent. Assuming positive data from the initial phase of the trial, the cohort-expansion phase is designed to further explore the selected dose of XB002 in individual tumor cohorts, which may include forms of NSCLC, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, UC, squamous cell head and neck cancers, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, mCRPC, triple negative breast cancer and hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, and will evaluate ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 as a primary endpoint as well as XB002’s safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile. We expect to provide clinical updates from the ongoing phase 1 study of XB002 during 2022. We also intend to initiate additional dose-escalation and expansion cohorts to evaluate the potential of XB002 in combination with ICIs and other targeted therapies across a wide range of tumor types, including indications other than those currently addressed by commercially available TF-targeted therapies. Since initiating the XB002 phase 1 trial, we amended our exclusive option and license agreement with Iconic in December 2021 to acquire broad rights to use the anti-TF antibody used in XB002 for any application, including conjugated to other payloads, as well as rights within oncology to a number of other anti-TF antibodies developed by Iconic, including for use in ADCs and multispecific biotherapeutics. 
For additional information on our business development activities with Iconic, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Research Collaborations, In-licensing Arrangements and Other Business Development Activities—Iconic.”
XL102 Development Program
XL102 (formerly AUR102) is the lead compound under our research collaboration with Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited (Aurigene). It is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable covalent inhibitor of CDK7, which is an important regulator of the cellular transcriptional and cell cycle machinery. Based on encouraging preclinical data for XL102, which we and Aurigene presented at the 32nd ENA Symposium in October 2020, we exercised our exclusive option to license XL102 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development of XL102. For additional information on our collaboration with Aurigene, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Research Collaborations, In-licensing Arrangements and Other Business Development Activities—Aurigene.”
Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND for XL102, in January 2021, we initiated a multicenter phase 1, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity, both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, in up to 298 patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The trial is divided into dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phases. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, with the primary objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose levels for daily oral administration of XL102 as a single agent, as well as in combination with fulvestrant for patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and with abiraterone and prednisone for patients with mCRPC. Combinations with other agents may also be evaluated. Assuming positive data from the initial phase of the trial, the cohort-expansion phase is designed to further explore the selected dose of XL102 as a 
single agent and in combination regimens in individual tumor cohorts, including ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and mCRPC, and will evaluate ORR per RECIST v. 1.1, as well as XL102’s safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile. We expect to provide clinical updates from the ongoing phase 1 study of XL102 during 2022.
XL114 Development Program
XL114 (formerly AUR104) is a novel anti-cancer compound that inhibits activation of the CBM complex, a key component of signaling downstream of B- and T-cell receptors, which promotes B- and T-cell lymphoma survival and proliferation. Constitutive activation of B- or T-cell receptor signaling is a common feature of B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, and therefore we believe CBM is an attractive target for the development of new anti-cancer therapies with the potential to treat lymphoid malignancies. Notably, the CBM complex is downstream of BTK, inhibitors of which are approved therapies for certain B-cell lymphomas. Inhibitors of CBM complex activation may therefore provide options for patients who develop resistance to BTK inhibitors. At the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April 2021, Aurigene presented preclinical data (Abstract 1266) demonstrating that XL114 exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity in a large panel of cancer cell lines ranging from hematological cancers to solid tumors with excellent selectivity over normal cells. We exercised our exclusive option to in-license XL114 in October 2021, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of XL114. For additional information on our collaboration with Aurigene, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Research Collaborations, In-licensing Arrangements and Other Business Development Activities —Aurigene.” 
The FDA accepted our IND application for XL114 in October 2021, and we plan to initiate a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the compound as a monotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in the first half of 2022. The trial will be divided into dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phases and will aim to enroll approximately 144 patients with advanced NHL. The dose-escalation phase of the trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose levels for daily oral administration of XL114 as a monotherapy. Assuming positive data from the initial phase of the trial, the cohort-expansion phase will enroll subjects in cohorts with diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, and will evaluate ORR based on lymphoma-specific response criteria.
Expansion of the Exelixis Pipeline
We are working to expand our oncology product pipeline through drug discovery efforts, which encompass our diverse small molecule and biotherapeutics programs exploring multiple modalities and mechanisms of action. This approach provides a high degree of flexibility with respect to target selection and allows us to prioritize those targets that we believe have the greatest chance of yielding impactful therapeutics. As part of our strategy, our drug discovery activities include research collaborations, in-licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions that serve to increase our discovery bandwidth and allow us to access a wide range of technology platforms. We also opened a new laboratory building on our Alameda campus in 2021, effectively tripling our available lab space and significantly enhancing the capacity and capability of our small molecule discovery efforts. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are currently advancing more than 10 discovery programs and expect to progress up to five new development candidates into preclinical development during 2022. In addition, we will continue to engage in business development initiatives with the goal of acquiring and in-licensing promising oncology platforms and assets and then further characterize and develop them utilizing our established preclinical and clinical development infrastructure. 
Small Molecule Programs
Our small molecule discovery programs are supported by a robust and expanding infrastructure, including a library of 4.6 million compounds. We have extensive experience in the identification and optimization of drug candidates against multiple target classes for oncology, inflammation and metabolic diseases.
Since our inception in 1994, our drug discovery group has advanced 25 compounds to the IND stage, either independently or with collaboration partners, and today we deploy our drug discovery expertise in medicinal chemistry, tumor biology and pharmacology to advance small molecule drug candidates toward and through preclinical development. These efforts are led by our experienced scientists, including some of the same scientists that led the efforts to discover cabozantinib, cobimetinib and esaxerenone, each of which are now commercially distributed drug products. In pursuit of new drug discoveries, we concentrate our in-house work on the most demanding and time-sensitive aspects of lead optimization and use contract research organizations to support more routine activities, thereby minimizing our footprint 
while still maintaining an agile, competitive approach. We also augment our small molecule discovery activities through research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements with other companies engaged in small molecule discovery, including:
•STORM Therapeutics LTD (STORM), which is focused on the discovery and development of inhibitors of novel RNA modifying enzymes, including ADAR1;
•Aurigene, which is focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecules as therapies for cancer; and
•StemSynergy Therapeutics, Inc. (StemSynergy), which is focused on the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds aimed to inhibit tumor growth by targeting Casein Kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) and the Notch pathway.
For additional information on these research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements related to our small molecule programs, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Research Collaborations, In-licensing Arrangements and Other Business Development Activities.”
Amongst our small molecule programs, furthest along are XL092, which was discovered at Exelixis, and XL102 and XL114, which were discovered at Aurigene. XL092 and XL102 entered the clinic in 2019 and 2021, respectively, and we plan to initiate a phase 1 clinical trial for XL114 in the first half of 2022. For additional information on these clinical trial programs, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates.” In addition, we continue to make progress on multiple, additional lead optimization programs for inhibitors of a variety of targets that we believe play significant roles in tumor growth, and we anticipate that some of these other programs could reach development candidate status in 2022.
Biotherapeutics Programs
We are also focusing our drug discovery activities on discovering and advancing various biotherapeutics that have the potential to become anti-cancer therapies, such as bispecific antibodies, ADCs and other innovative treatments. The great potential of these classes has been evidenced by the multiple regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of ADCs in the past several years. To facilitate the growth of these programs, we have established multiple research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements and entered into other strategic transactions that provide us with access to antibodies and binders, which are the starting point for use with additional technology platforms that we employ to generate next-generation ADCs or multispecific antibodies. Our current research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements for biotherapeutics programs include: 
•WuXi Biologics Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc. (individually and collectively referred to as WuXi Bio), which is focused on leveraging WuXi Bio’s panel of mAbs for the development of ADC, bispecific and certain other novel tumor-targeting biotherapeutics applications;
•Adagene Inc. (Adagene), which is focused on using Adagene’s SAFEbodyTM technology to develop novel masked ADCs or other innovative biotherapeutics with potential for improved therapeutic index;
•Catalent, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries Redwood Bioscience, Inc., R.P. Scherer Technologies, LLC and Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. (individually and collectively referred to as Catalent), which is focused on the discovery and development of multiple ADCs using Catalent’s proprietary SMARTag® site-specific bioconjugation technology;
•NBE-Therapeutics AG (NBE), which is focused on the discovery and development of multiple ADCs by leveraging NBE’s unique expertise and proprietary platforms in ADC discovery, including NBE’s SMAC-Technology™ (a site-specific conjugation technology) and novel payloads;
•Iconic, which is focused on the advancement of a next-generation TF-targeting ADC program in solid tumors; and
•Invenra, Inc. (Invenra), which is focused on the discovery and development of novel binders and multispecific antibodies for the treatment of cancer.
We have already made significant progress under these arrangements and believe we will continue to do so in 2022 and future years. For example, based on promising preclinical data for XB002, we exercised our exclusive option to license XB002 in December 2020. Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND for XB002 in April 2021, we initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in June 2021. For additional information on XB002, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates—XB002 Development Program.” Also, as a direct result of these arrangements, we designated XB010, our first ADC advanced internally, as a development candidate in late 2021. 
XB010, which targets the tumor antigen 5T4, incorporates antibodies sourced from Invenra and was constructed using Catalent’s SMARTag site-specific bioconjugation platform.
In addition, in May 2021, we executed an asset purchase agreement with GamaMabs Pharma SA (GamaMabs), under which we will, upon the closing of the asset purchase and subject to certain conditions, acquire all rights, title and interest in GamaMabs’ antibody program directed at anti-Müllerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2), a novel oncology target with relevance in multiple forms of cancer. And most recently, in January 2022, we announced an amendment to our May 2019 exclusive option and license agreement with Iconic to acquire broad rights to use the anti-TF antibody used in XB002 for any application, including conjugated to other payloads. For additional information on these specific research collaborations, in-licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions related to our biotherapeutics programs, see “—Collaborations and Business Development Activities—Research Collaborations, In-licensing Arrangements and Other Business Development Activities.”
Collaborations and Business Development Activities
We have established multiple collaborations with leading biopharmaceutical companies for the commercialization and further development of the cabozantinib franchise. Additionally, we have made considerable progress under our existing research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements to further enhance our early-stage pipeline and expand our ability to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies with the goal of providing new treatment options for cancer patients and their physicians. We expect to enter into additional, external collaborative relationships around assets and technologies that complement our drug discovery and clinical development efforts. Consistent with our business strategy prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, we also entered into other collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies including Genentech and Daiichi Sankyo for other compounds and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our collaborations, we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties or, in the case of cobimetinib, royalties from sales outside the U.S. and a share of profits (or losses) from commercialization in the U.S.
Cabozantinib Commercial Collaborations
Ipsen Collaboration
In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib. Under the collaboration agreement, Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside of the U.S., Canada and Japan. The collaboration agreement was subsequently amended on three occasions, including in December 2016 to include commercialization rights in Canada. We have also agreed to collaborate with Ipsen on the development of cabozantinib for current and potential future indications. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint steering committee and appropriate subcommittees established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation and strategic direction; provided, however, that we retain final decision-making authority with respect to cabozantinib’s ongoing development. 
 In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, including commercialization rights in Canada, Ipsen paid us aggregate upfront payments of $210.0 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved aggregate milestone payments of $462.5 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement, including a milestone payment during 2021 of $12.5 million upon Ipsen’s submission of a variation application to the EMA for CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated, RAI-refractory DTC. In addition, we recorded in license revenues a $100.0 million milestone from Ipsen in connection with the achievement of $400.0 million of net sales of cabozantinib in the related Ipsen license territory over four consecutive quarters, and we expect to receive the milestone payment in the first quarter of 2022.
 We are also eligible to receive future development and regulatory milestone payments from Ipsen, totaling an aggregate of $46.5 million upon additional approvals of cabozantinib in future indications and/or jurisdictions, as well as contingent payments of up to $350.0 million and CAD$26.5 million associated with future sales milestones. We will further receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen outside of the U.S. and Japan. We were initially entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 2% to 12% on the initial $150.0 million of net sales; this amount was reached in the second quarter of 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and going forward, we are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 22% to 26% on annual net sales, with separate tiers for Canada; these 22% to 26% royalty tiers reset each calendar year. As of December 31, 2021, we have earned royalties of $272.1 million on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement. 
We received notification that, effective January 1, 2021, Royalty Pharma plc (Royalty Pharma) acquired from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) all rights, title and interest in royalties on total net sales of any product containing cabozantinib for non-U.S. markets for the full term of the royalty and for the U.S. market through September 2026, after which time U.S. royalties will revert back to GSK. Accordingly, and consistent with our historical agreement with GSK, we are required to pay a 3% royalty to Royalty Pharma on total net sales of any product incorporating cabozantinib, including net sales by Ipsen.
We are responsible for funding cabozantinib-related development costs for those trials in existence at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement with Ipsen; global development costs for additional trials are shared between the parties, with Ipsen reimbursing us for 35% of such costs, provided Ipsen chooses to opt into such trials. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Ipsen has opted into and is co-funding certain clinical trials, including: CheckMate -9ER, COSMIC-021, COSMIC-311, COSMIC-312, CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02. With respect to Ipsen’s decision in the second quarter of 2021 to opt into and co-fund COSMIC-311 development costs, Ipsen is now responsible for 35% of the global development costs of COSMIC-311 and is obligated to reimburse us for these costs, as well as an additional payment calculated as a percentage of COSMIC-311 development costs, triggered by the timing of the exercise of its option.
We remain responsible for manufacturing and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. Relatedly, we entered into a supply agreement with Ipsen to supply finished and labeled drug product to Ipsen for distribution in the territories outside of the U.S. and Japan for the term of the collaboration agreement as well as a quality agreement that provides respective quality responsibilities for the aforementioned supply. Furthermore, at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement, the parties also entered into a pharmacovigilance agreement, which defines each partner’s responsibilities for safety reporting. The pharmacovigilance agreement also requires us to maintain the global safety database for cabozantinib. To meet our obligations to regulatory authorities for the reporting of safety data from territories outside of the U.S. and Japan from sources other than our sponsored global clinical development trials, we rely on data collected and reported to us by Ipsen.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latter of (1) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib or (3) ten years after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib, other than COMETRIQ. The supply agreement will continue in effect until expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach of either the collaboration agreement or the supply agreement by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if Ipsen challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. Ipsen may terminate the collaboration agreement if the FDA or EMA orders or requires substantially all cabozantinib clinical trials to be terminated. Ipsen also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement on a region-by-region basis after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in advanced RCC in the given region. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Ipsen will automatically terminate, and, except in the event of a termination by Ipsen for our material breach, the licenses granted by Ipsen to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide, or, if Ipsen were to terminate only for a particular region, then for the terminated region. Following termination by us for Ipsen’s material breach, or termination by Ipsen without cause or because we undergo a change of control by a party engaged in a competing program, Ipsen is prohibited from competing with us for a period of time.
Takeda Collaboration
In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda, which was subsequently amended on three occasions to, among other things, modify the amount of reimbursements we receive for costs associated with our required pharmacovigilance activities and milestones we are eligible to receive, as well as modify certain cost sharing obligations related to the Japan-specific development costs associated with CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02. Under the collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan, and the parties have agreed to collaborate on the clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. The operation and strategic direction of the parties’ collaboration is governed through a joint executive committee and appropriate subcommittees.
In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50.0 million from Takeda in 2017. As of December 31, 2021, we have also achieved regulatory and development milestones in the aggregate of $127.0 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda since the inception of the collaboration agreement, including milestone payments during 2021 of (1) $20.0 million upon Takeda’s first commercial sale in Japan of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic RCC and (2) $15.0 million in connection with the initiations of CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02. We are eligible 
to receive additional regulatory and development milestone payments, without limit, for additional potential future indications.
We are further eligible to receive commercial milestones, including milestone payments earned for the first commercial sale of a product, of up to $119.0 million. We also receive royalties on the net sales of cabozantinib in Japan. We are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 15% to 24% on the initial $300.0 million of net sales, and following this initial $300.0 million of net sales, we are then entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 20% to 30% on annual net sales thereafter; these 20% to 30% royalty tiers reset each calendar year. As of December 31, 2021, we have earned royalties of $10.2 million on net sales of cabozantinib by Takeda since the inception of the collaboration agreement.
Consistent with our historical agreement with GSK, we are required to pay a 3% royalty to Royalty Pharma on total net sales of any product incorporating cabozantinib, including net sales by Takeda. 
Except for CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02, Takeda is responsible for 20% of the costs associated with the cabozantinib development plan’s current and future trials, provided Takeda opts into such trials, and 100% of costs associated with the cabozantinib development activities that are exclusively for the benefit of Japan. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Takeda has opted into and is co-funding CheckMate -9ER, certain cohorts of COSMIC-021, CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02.
Under the collaboration agreement, we are responsible for the manufacturing and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. Relatedly, we entered into a clinical supply agreement covering the supply of cabozantinib to Takeda for the term of the collaboration agreement, as well as a quality agreement that provides respective quality responsibilities for the aforementioned supply. Furthermore, at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement, the parties also entered into a safety data exchange agreement, which defines each partner’s responsibility for safety reporting. This agreement also requires us to maintain the global safety database for cabozantinib. To meet our obligations to regulatory authorities for the reporting of safety data from Japan from sources other than our sponsored global clinical development trials, we rely on data collected and reported to us by Takeda.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the earlier of (1) two years after first generic entry with respect to such product in Japan or (2) the later of (A) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib and (B) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib in Japan. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. For clarity, Takeda’s failure to achieve specified levels of commercial performance, based upon sales volume and/or promotional effort, during the first six years of the collaboration will constitute a material breach of the collaboration agreement. We may terminate the agreement if Takeda challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. After the commercial launch of cabozantinib in Japan, Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement upon twelve months’ prior written notice following the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in Japan. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Takeda will automatically terminate, and the licenses granted by Takeda to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide.
Cabozantinib Development Collaborations 
BMS
In February 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of exploring the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in combination with BMS’s ICIs, nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, to treat a variety of types of cancer. As part of the collaboration, we are evaluating the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab as a treatment option for RCC in the COSMIC-313 trial. For a description of the COSMIC-313 trial, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements—Combination Studies with BMS.”
Under the collaboration agreement with BMS, which was subsequently amended on three occasions, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (within the collaboration territory as defined in the collaboration agreement and its supplemental agreements), non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the other party’s compounds in the conduct of each clinical trial. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint development committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation. Each trial is conducted under a combination IND application, unless otherwise required by a regulatory authority. Each party is responsible for supplying finished drug product for the 
applicable clinical trial, and responsibility for the payment of costs for each such trial will be determined on a trial-by-trial basis. Following the FDA’s approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, we and BMS commenced the commercial launch of the combination and have agreed to pursue commercialization and marketing efforts independently.
Roche
In February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with Roche for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and Roche’s ICI, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Under this agreement with Roche, in June 2017, we initiated COSMIC-021 and in December 2018, we initiated COSMIC-312. We are the sponsor of both trials, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. For descriptions of the COSMIC-021 and COSMIC-312 trials, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements—Combination Studies with Roche.”
Building upon encouraging clinical activity observed in COSMIC-021, in December 2019 we entered into a joint clinical research agreement with Roche for the purpose of further evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including in the CONTACT-01, CONTACT-02 and CONTACT-03 studies. If a party to the joint clinical research agreement proposes any additional combined therapy trials beyond these three ongoing phase 3 pivotal trials, the joint clinical research agreement provides that such proposing party must notify the other party and that if agreed to, any such additional combined therapy trial will become part of the collaboration, or if not agreed to, the proposing party may conduct such additional combined therapy trial independently, subject to specified restrictions set forth in the joint clinical research agreement.
Under the joint clinical research agreement, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (excluding, in our case, territory already the subject of a license by us to Takeda), non-transferable, royalty-free license, with a right to sublicense (subject to limitations), to use the other party’s intellectual property and compounds solely as necessary for the party to perform its obligations under the joint clinical research agreement. The parties’ efforts will be governed through a joint steering committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration and the conduct of the combined therapy trials. Each party will be responsible for providing clinical supply for all combined therapy trials, and the cost of the supply will be borne by such party. The clinical trial expenses for each combined therapy trial agreed to be conducted jointly under the joint clinical research agreement will be shared equally between the parties, and the clinical trial expenses for each additional combined therapy trial not agreed to be conducted jointly under the joint clinical research agreement will be borne by the proposing party, except that the cost of clinical supply for all combined therapy trials will be borne by the party that owns the applicable product. 
Unless earlier terminated, the joint clinical research agreement provides that it will remain in effect until the completion of all combined therapy trials under the collaboration, the delivery of all related trial data to both parties, and the completion of any then agreed-upon additional analyses. The joint clinical research agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on any uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. Upon termination by either party, the licenses granted to each party will terminate upon completion of any ongoing activities under the joint clinical research agreement.
XL092 Clinical Collaborations
In an effort to diversify our exploration of the therapeutic potential of XL092, we have also entered into multiple supply agreements to evaluate XL092 in various combination trials, including with Roche’s atezolizumab, Merck KGaA and Pfizer’s avelumab, BMS’ nivolumab and ipilimumab and Nektar’s bempegaldesleukin. These supply agreements will facilitate the efficient exploration of the safety and efficacy of XL092 in combinations with a variety of established cancer therapies as we continue to build a broad development program for XL092. For descriptions of our ongoing clinical trials evaluating XL092 in combination with other therapies, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates—XL092 Development Program.”

In September 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with NBE to discover and develop multiple ADCs for oncology applications by leveraging NBE’s unique expertise and proprietary platforms in ADC discovery, 
including NBE’s SMAC-Technology and novel payloads. Under the Agreement, we made an upfront payment in exchange for exclusive options to nominate four targets using NBE’s ADC platform over a two-year period. In addition, within the first 18 months of the agreement term, we also have the right to extend the target selection term to three years for an additional payment. For each option we decide to exercise, we will be required to pay an exercise fee, and we would then assume responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization connected with any resulting program. NBE would then become eligible for potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. We have also committed to contribute research funding to NBE for discovery and preclinical development work.
Aurigene
In July 2019, we entered into an exclusive collaboration, option and license agreement with Aurigene to in-license as many as six oncology target programs to discover and develop small molecules as therapies for cancer, and in April 2021, we expanded the collaboration to include three additional early discovery programs for a total of nine programs. Under the agreement, we made upfront payments in exchange for exclusive options to license eight of the nine programs to date, and we will pay an additional upfront payment upon the nomination of the ninth program. Based on encouraging preclinical data for XL102, the lead Aurigene program targeting CDK7, we exercised our exclusive option to license XL102 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of XL102 and payment of an exercise fee to Aurigene. We also submitted an IND for XL102 in November 2020, and following the FDA’s acceptance of the IND in December 2020, we initiated a phase 1 clinical trial of XL102 in January 2021 designed to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy, both as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer therapies. For additional information on XL102, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates—XL102 Development Program.” In addition, we exercised our exclusive option to in-license XL114, Aurigene’s novel CBM inhibitor, in October 2021, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of XL114 and payment of an option exercise fee to Aurigene. Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND application for the small molecule in October 2021, we plan to initiate a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating XL114 as a monotherapy in patients with NHL in the first half of 2022. For additional information on XL114, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates—XL114 Development Program.” With respect to each of XL102 and XL114, Aurigene is eligible for potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. 
Beyond XL102 and XL114, we are continuing to work with Aurigene to advance the other small molecule programs through preclinical development. For each additional option we decide to exercise, we will be required to pay an exercise fee, and we would then assume responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization for that program. Aurigene would then become eligible for potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. We are also responsible for research funding for the discovery and preclinical development work on these programs. Under the agreement, Aurigene retains limited development and commercial rights for India and Russia.
Iconic
In May 2019, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Iconic to advance an innovative next-generation ADC program for cancer, leveraging Iconic’s expertise in targeting TF in solid tumors. Under the original May 2019 agreement, we gained an exclusive option to license XB002, Iconic’s lead TF ADC program, in exchange for an upfront payment to Iconic and a commitment for preclinical development funding. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we exercised our exclusive option to license XB002 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization for XB002 and payment of an option exercise fee to Iconic. Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND for XB002 in April 2021, we initiated a phase 1 clinical trial of XB002 in June 2021 designed to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. For additional information on XLB002, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Other Development Programs - Advancing Exelixis’ Future Cancer Therapy Candidates—XB002 Development Program.”
In January 2022, we announced an amendment to our agreement with Iconic, which we entered into in December 2021, to acquire broad rights to use the anti-TF antibody used in XB002 for any application, including conjugated to other payloads, as well as rights within oncology to a number of other anti-TF antibodies developed by Iconic, including for use in ADCs and multispecific biotherapeutics. Under the amended agreement, we made a final payment to Iconic and will not 
owe Iconic any further payments, but we will continue to be responsible for milestone payments and royalties owed to other companies pursuant to prior agreements between Iconic and those companies.
Invenra
In May 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Invenra to discover and develop multispecific antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Invenra is responsible for antibody lead discovery and generation while we will lead IND-enabling studies, manufacturing, clinical development in single-agent and combination therapy regimens, and future regulatory and commercialization activities. The collaboration agreement provides that we will receive an exclusive, worldwide license to one preclinical, multispecific antibody asset, and that we will pursue multiple additional discovery projects across three different programs during the term of the collaboration. In October 2019, we expanded our collaboration to include the development of novel binders against six additional targets, which we can use to generate multispecific antibodies based on Invenra’s B-BodyTM technology platform, or with other platforms and formats at our option. We amended the agreement again in March 2020 and January 2021 to enable the use of target binders in non-Invenra platform-based modalities, such as ADC platforms, and to enable the development of biparatropic antibodies, respectively. Then in August 2021, we further expanded our collaboration to include an additional 20 targets for biotherapeutics discovery and development, for which we agreed to pay Invenra exclusivity payments and research program funding over a three-year period.
Under the collaboration, Invenra is eligible for project initiation fees and potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of any approved products. We also have the right to exercise options with respect to certain of Invenra’s other research programs in exchange for an option exercise payment, and Invenra is eligible for milestone payments and royalties for any products that arise from these optioned research programs.
StemSynergy
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with StemSynergy for the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds targeting CK1α, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in key oncogenic processes, including in colorectal cancers. One such compound, EXEL-4329, reached development candidate status in 2021. In May 2021, we amended the agreement to provide for an additional research platform to explore inhibitors of the Notch pathway, a major developmental pathway that regulates cancer stem cells in Notch-driven cancers, such as certain types of T-cell lymphomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas. Under the agreement, we paid StemSynergy upfront payments in each of 2018 and 2021, and StemSynergy is eligible for additional research and development funding on an as needed basis. StemSynergy is also eligible for potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. We will be solely responsible for the commercialization of products that arise from the collaboration.
Other Collaborations
Prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, our primary business strategy was focused on the development and out-license of compounds to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under collaboration agreements that allowed us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products. Our collaboration agreements with Genentech and Daiichi Sankyo described below are representative of this historical strategy. We have since evolved and are now a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on driving the expansion and depth of our product offerings through the continued development of the cabozantinib franchise and drug discovery efforts, including research collaborations, in-licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions that align with our oncology drug development, regulatory and commercialization expertise, all to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer around the world. While the historical collaboration agreements described below have the potential to provide future revenue, and while we have already received some collaboration revenues from these arrangements, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these historical collaboration agreements unless and until our partnered compounds generate substantial sales in the territories and indications where they are approved. If these events occur, then the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits under our historical collaboration agreements could become substantial.
Genentech - Cobimetinib
In December 2006, we out-licensed the further development and commercialization of cobimetinib to Genentech pursuant to a worldwide collaboration agreement. Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of MEK, a kinase that is a 
component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Under the collaboration agreement, Genentech received an exclusive worldwide revenue-bearing license to cobimetinib and is responsible for all future clinical development of the compound. On November 10, 2015, the FDA approved cobimetinib, under the brand name COTELLIC, in combination with Genentech’s ZELBORAF (vemurafenib) as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma. COTELLIC in combination with ZELBORAF has also been approved in Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and multiple additional countries for use in the same indication. On July 30, 2020, the FDA approved COTELLIC, in combination with Genentech’s ZELBORAF and TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma in previously untreated patients.
Under the collaboration agreement, as amended in July 2017, we share in the profits and losses received or incurred in connection with COTELLIC’s commercialization in the U.S. In addition to our profit share in the U.S., we are entitled to low double-digit royalties on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. During 2021, we earned royalties of $4.1 million on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. and a $8.1 million profit on the profit and loss sharing of U.S. actual sales which are recorded in collaboration services revenues. Since the inception of the collaboration agreement, we have also received aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $50.0 million and are not eligible for any additional milestone payments.
In addition to its established commercialization of COTELLIC, Genentech continues to progress the clinical development, regulatory status and commercial potential of cobimetinib. Cobimetinib is being evaluated in a broad development program consisting of multiple clinical trials by Genentech or through Genentech’s IST program. Should these trials yield supporting data and Genentech obtain regulatory approvals based on such supporting data, we believe that cobimetinib may provide us with an additional source of revenue in the future.
Daiichi Sankyo - Esaxerenone
In March 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against the MR, a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Under the collaboration agreement, we granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate MR, including esaxerenone, an oral, non-steroidal, selective MR antagonist. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for all further preclinical and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the compounds and we do not have rights to reacquire such compounds.
In January 2019, the Japanese MHLW first approved esaxerenone under the brand name MINNEBRO, as a treatment essential hypertension in Japan. As of December 31, 2021, we have received an aggregate of $65.5 million in development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments related to MINNEBRO over the life of the collaboration agreement and are eligible to receive additional commercialization milestone payments of up to $90.0 million. We are also entitled to receive low double-digit royalties on sales of MINNEBRO. As of December 31, 2021, we have earned royalties of $5.3 million on net sales of MINNEBRO by Daiichi Sankyo since the approval of MINNEBRO in January 2019. Pursuant to a license agreement we entered into with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ligand), we are required to pay a royalty of 0.5% to Ligand on net sales of MINNEBRO.
Daiichi Sankyo has further advanced the development program for esaxerenone, and in November 2019, Daiichi Sankyo announced positive results from a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating esaxerenone as a treatment option for patients in Japan with diabetic nephropathy. Should Daiichi Sankyo obtain regulatory approval based on these results, and taking into account the approval of MINNEBRO by the MHLW for the treatment of hypertension and Daiichi Sankyo’s subsequent commercial sales of MINNEBRO, we believe that esaxerenone may provide an additional source of revenue in the future.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) development activities, preclinical, clinical or commercial production and distribution for our current products. Instead, we rely on various third-party contract manufacturing organizations to conduct these operations on our behalf. As our operations continue to grow in these areas, we continue to expand our supply chain through secondary third-party contract manufacturers, distributors and suppliers. Specifically, we entered into agreements with secondary contract manufacturing organizations to produce additional commercial supplies of CABOMETYX tablets and cabozantinib drug substance, which bolsters our commercial supply chain and serves to mitigate the risk of supply chain interruptions or other failures. For our portfolio of small molecules and biotherapeutics, we continue to expand our network through well-established and reputable global third-party contract manufacturers for our CMC development and manufacturing that have good 
regulatory standing, suitable manufacturing capacities and capabilities. These third parties must comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), the EC’s Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice (GDP), as well as other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, as applicable, and are subject to routine inspections by such regulatory agencies. In addition, through our third-party contract manufacturers and data service providers, we continue to provide serialized commercial products as required to comply with the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).
We monitor and evaluate the performance of our third-party contract manufacturers on an ongoing basis for compliance with these requirements and to affirm their continuing capabilities to meet both our commercial and clinical needs. We also have contracted with a third-party logistics provider, with multiple distribution locations, to provide shipping and warehousing services for our commercial supply of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. We employ highly skilled personnel with both technical and manufacturing experience to diligently manage the activities at our third-party contract manufacturers and other supply chain partners, and our quality department audits them on a periodic basis.
We source raw materials that are used to manufacture our drug substance from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia, Europe and North America. We stock sufficient quantities of these materials and provide them to our third-party drug substance contract manufacturers so they can manufacture adequate drug substance quantities per our requirements, for both clinical and commercial purposes. We then store drug substance at third-party facilities and provide appropriate amounts to our third-party drug product contract manufacturers, who then manufacture, package and label our specified quantities of finished goods for COMETRIQ and CABOMETYX, respectively. In addition, we rely on our third-party contract manufacturers to source materials such as excipients, components and reagents, which are required to manufacture our drug substance and finished drug product.
In addition to having expanded our supply chain to include secondary contract manufacturing organizations, we have established and continue to maintain sufficient safety stock inventories for our drug substance and drug products, and we store these quantities in multiple locations. The quantities that we store are based on our business needs and take into account scenarios for market demand, production lead times, potential supply interruptions and shelf life for our drug substance and drug products. While our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included more frequent engagement with our vendors to maintain the consistency and effectiveness of our third-party contract manufacturers and other supply chain partners, we have not experienced significant production delays or seen significant impairment to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Update” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that our current manufacturing network has the appropriate capacity to produce sufficient commercial quantities of CABOMETYX to support the currently approved RCC, HCC and DTC indications, as well as potential additional indications if trials evaluating CABOMETYX in those indications prove to be successful and gain regulatory approval in the future. Our manufacturing footprint also enables us to fulfill our supply obligations for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to our collaboration partners for global development and commercial purposes.
Marketing and Sales
We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our sales team promotes CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. We market our products in the U.S. and concentrate our efforts on oncologists, oncology nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. In addition to using customary in-person pharmaceutical company practices, we also utilize digital marketing technologies to expand our engagement opportunities with customers. 
Our commercial products, CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, are sold initially through wholesale distribution and specialty pharmacy channels and then, if applicable, resold to hospitals and other organizations that provide CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to end-user patients. To facilitate our commercial activities in the U.S., we also employ various third parties, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and vendors providing other sales-support related services as needed, including digital marketing and other non-personal promotion. We believe that our commercial team and distribution practices are sufficient to facilitate our marketing efforts in reaching our target audience and our delivery of our products to patients in a timely and compliant fashion.
In addition, we rely on Ipsen and Takeda for ongoing and further commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX in territories outside of the U.S., as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under named patient use programs or similar programs with the effect of introducing earlier patient access to CABOMETYX, 
and we also rely on Ipsen for these same activities with respect to the commercialization and distribution of COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. For COTELLIC, we rely on Genentech, as our collaboration partner, for all current and future commercialization and marketing activities, with the exception of the limited co-promotion activities highlighted above.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the U.S. have appropriate access to CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, we have established a comprehensive reimbursement and patient support program called Exelixis Access Services (EASE). Through EASE, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria. In addition, EASE provides comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support, benefits investigation and, if needed, appeals support. Beyond financial assistance, patients who participate in EASE also receive treatment coordination through a dedicated case manager, as well as clinical outreach and support from a network of oncology nurses or other healthcare professionals who help many of these patients better understand how to take their medication and mitigate side effects.
Environmental, Health and Safety
Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals. In the U.S., at the federal, state and local levels, and in other foreign countries, we are subject to environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. While we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Laboratory Safety Program
Due to the focus of our business in discovering and developing drug products, many of our employees work in our on-site laboratory facilities. All new laboratory staff are trained on chemical hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, and certain other relevant laboratory safety topics, such as working with blood-borne pathogens, and current staff are retrained regularly. We also extend these trainings to facilities staff and others who support our work in the labs. In an effort to maintain a safe environment for all staff, we regularly perform thorough safety inspections of our laboratories, and continuously update our procedures based on the observations made during these inspections. Additionally, we conduct periodic industrial hygiene monitoring to ensure lab staff working with certain known hazardous chemicals do not exceed regulated exposure limits, and we regularly test and certify fume hoods, biosafety cabinets and other individual pieces of equipment on which employees rely to maintain a safe work environment.
Workplace Safety Measures in Response to COVID-19
We will continue to monitor the latest guidance issued by health authorities and have instituted several policies and procedures to protect against the spread of COVID-19 among our workforce. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have implemented a vaccination mandate and maintain several enhanced safety and social distancing protocols at our headquarters. In addition, we also offer on-site, rapid PCR COVID-19 testing, and utilize a mobile device app and web interface, which enable our team members to perform daily symptom tracking and schedule on-site tests at the Exelixis headquarters, and which also provide contact tracing and educational resources for any team member who may have tested positive.
Other policies and procedures currently include frequent disinfection of common areas by our operations staff and investments in re-engineering workspace safety, such as providing ample supplies of hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes and facemasks for use by our staff, and adjusting our ventilation systems in an effort to minimize risks of airborne transmission. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has presented several new challenges for us, to date, we have only experienced a modest impact on our productivity without significant interruptions in our general business operations. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Update” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Clinical Development
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, marketing approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, post-marketing safety reporting, export, import, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our products.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, some of which must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP);
•submission of an IND, which contains results of nonclinical studies (e.g., laboratory evaluations of the chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity of the product candidate), together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials conducted in accordance with the protocol, IND and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug candidate for its proposed intended use;
•for drug products, submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for commercial marketing, or generally of an sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;
•for biotherapeutic products, submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for commercial marketing, or generally a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;
•pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators, clinical trial sites and/or Exelixis as the clinical trial sponsor for their compliance with GMP and GCP, respectively;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of an NDA or BLA unless a fee waiver applies;
•agreement with the FDA on the final labeling for the product;
•if the FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and
•FDA approval of the NDA or sNDA, or BLA or sBLA.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 studies, which involve the initial introduction of a new drug product candidate into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, tolerability, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or patients. In rare cases, a Phase 1 study that is designed to assess effectiveness may serve as the basis for FDA marketing approval of a drug or for a label expansion. For instance, at FDA’s discretion, a product may receive approval based on a Phase 1b study if effectiveness results from the study are extremely compelling, approval of the drug would address a significant unmet patient need, and the drug is being approved through the accelerated approval pathway. As discussed below, Accelerated Approval generally requires a post-approval study to confirm clinical benefit.
•Phase 2 studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosage, and common short-term side effect and risks associated with the drug. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
•Phase 3 studies are conducted to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety across a higher number of patients and evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate following earlier phase evaluations, which will have provided preliminary evidence suggesting an effective dosage range 
and acceptable safety profile for the product candidate. Phase 3 trials are also intended to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling of the product if it is approved.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called post-marketing or “phase 4” studies may be deemed a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of NDA approval. 
FDA Review and Approval
For approval of a new drug or changes to the labeling of an approved drug, including new indications, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, or as part of an sNDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions, although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of an advisory committee. The FDA may initially issue a Refuse to File letter for an incomplete NDA or sNDA, or it may deny approval of an NDA or sNDA by way of a Complete Response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or alternatively require additional clinical and/or nonclinical data and/or an additional phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Satisfaction of FDA development and approval requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including obtaining prior FDA approval of certain changes to the approved NDA, record-keeping requirements, and reporting of adverse experiences with, and interruptions in the manufacture of, the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Thus, we and our third-party contract manufacturing organizations are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain manufacturing requirements (including procedural and documentation requirements) upon us and our third-party contract manufacturing organizations.
In the U.S., the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, provides incentives for the development of drugs and biotherapeutic products for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. (or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.). Certain of the incentives turn on the drug first being designated as an orphan drug. To be eligible for designation as an orphan drug (Orphan Drug Designation), the drug must have the potential to treat such rare disease or condition as described above. In addition, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug,” as defined in the FDA’s orphan drug regulations, for the same orphan-designated indication or the sponsor of the subsequent drug must provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved same drug. Upon receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 25% for qualified clinical trial expenses and waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity if no drug considered the same drug was previously approved for the same orphan condition (or if the subsequent drug is demonstrated to be clinically superior to any such previously approved same drug). Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break an approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
Expedited FDA Approval Pathways
The FDA has various programs that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. Examples of such programs included Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, and the eligibility criteria of and benefits for each program vary: 
•Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions that demonstrate the potential to fill unmet medical needs, by providing, among other things, eligibility for accelerated approval if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review, 
which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. 
•Breakthrough therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, and rolling review.
•Priority review is designed to shorten the review period for drugs that treat serious conditions and that, if approved, would offer significant advances in safety or effectiveness or would provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Under priority review, the FDA aims to take action on the application within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Sponsors may also obtain a priority review voucher upon approval of an NDA for certain qualifying diseases and conditions that can be applied to a subsequent NDA submission
•Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or an intermediate clinical endpoint, which is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA requires that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials or provide data on established clinical endpoints from the same trial to confirm the clinical benefit as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. The failure to conduct such trials, or confirm the clinically meaningful outcome in such trials, may result in withdrawal of the approval of the drug or the indication approved under accelerated approval.
Specifically, with respect to oncology products, the FDA may review applications under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program established by the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. The RTOR pilot program, which allows an applicant to pre-submit components of the application to allow the FDA to review clinical data before the complete filing is submitted, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. Drugs considered for review under the RTOR pilot program must be likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted breakthrough therapy designation for the same or other indications, and must have straight-forward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted.
Abbreviated FDA Approval Pathways and Generic Products
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (The Hatch-Waxman Act) established two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products in which potential competitors may rely upon the FDA’s prior approval of the same or similar drug product.
•Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An ANDA may be approved by the FDA if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed generic product is the same as the approved drug, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness through clinical development. Conducting bioequivalence testing is generally less time consuming and costly than conducting a full set of clinical trials in humans. In this regard, the FDA has published draft guidance containing product-specific bioequivalence recommendations for drug products containing cabozantinib, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, as it does for many FDA-approved drug products.
•505(b)(2) NDAs. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Under Section 505(b)(2) NDA of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), an applicant may rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. If the 505(b)(2) applicant establishes that reliance on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product is 
scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies. The FDA may require additional studies or measurements, including comparability studies.
Unlike a full NDA for which the sponsor has conducted or obtained a right of reference to all the data essential to approval, the filing of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides (a) up to five years of exclusivity for the first approval of a new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity and (b) three years of exclusivity for approval of an NDA or sNDA for a product that is not an NCE but rather where the application contains new clinical studies conducted or sponsored by the sponsor and considered essential to the approval of the NDA or sNDA (three-year “changes” exclusivity). NCE exclusivity runs from the time of approval of the NDA and bars FDA from accepting for review of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a drug containing the same active moiety for five years (or for four years if the application contains a Paragraph IV certification that a reference product patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA/505(b)(2) NDA product). The three-year “changes” exclusivity generally bars the FDA from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application that relies on the information supporting the approval of the drug or the change to the drug for which the information was submitted and the exclusivity granted.
Both Congress and the FDA are considering, and have enacted, various legislative and regulatory proposals focused on drug competition, including legislation focused on drug patenting and provision of drug to generic applicants for testing. For example, the Ensuring Innovation Act, enacted in April 2021, amended the FDA’s statutory authority for granting NCE exclusivity to reflect the agency’s existing regulations and longstanding interpretation that award NCE exclusivity based on a drug’s active moiety, as opposed to its active ingredient, which is intended to limit the applicability of NCE exclusivity, thereby potentially facilitating generic competition. The FDA has also released, and continues to implement, a Drug Competition Action Plan, which proposes actions to broaden access to generic drugs and lower consumers’ healthcare costs by, among other things, improving the efficiency of the generic drug approval process and supporting the development of complex generic drugs. In addition, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, which incorporated the framework from the Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples (CREATES) legislation, purports to promote competition in the market for drugs and biotherapeutic products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biotherapeutic products, including by allowing ANDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or biosimilar developers to obtain access to branded drug and biotherapeutic product samples.
Orange Book Listing. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or approved method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the RLD that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may also submit a statement that it intends to carve-out from the labeling of its product an RLD’s use that is protected by exclusivity or a method of use patent. The fourth certification described above is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the reference NDA holder. The reference NDA holder and patent owners may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. Filing such a lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA also will not receive final approval until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired. We intend to defend vigorously any patents for our approved products.
Regulatory Approval Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
The way clinical trials are conducted in the EU has undergone a major change with the application of Regulation (EU) 536/2014, repealing the existing Directive 2001/20/EC. This new regulation harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU, via an EU portal and database, which the EMA will maintain in collaboration with the Member States and the EC. Following the EC’s confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union in August 2021, Regulation (EU) 536/2014 became applicable concurrent with the CTIS “go-live” date on January 31, 2022.
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) either under centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the EMA for scientific review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) so that an opinion is issued on product approvability. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for granting the centralized marketing authorization in the form of a binding EC decision. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, collectively the European Economic Area. The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, as well as national authorization procedure are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the EU Member States selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another Member State, referred to as the Reference Member State (RMS). The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any Member State. Under this procedure the applicant can select the Member State that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the Member States where marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each Concerned Member State must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment or reject it on the basis of potential serious risk to public health. If the disputed points cannot be resolved, the matter is eventually referred to the Coordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures in the first instance to reach an agreement and failing to reach such an agreement, a referral to the EMA and the CHMP for arbitration that will result in an opinion to form the basis of a decision to be issued by the EC binding on all Member States. If the application is successful during the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure, national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the Member States chosen by the applicant.
Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted in the centralized procedure for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in EU law applicable to conditional marketing authorizations where the clinical dataset is not comprehensive, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the EU, orphan designation is available for products in development which are either: (a) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU; or (b) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition affecting a larger number of persons but when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor of an application for designation of a product as an orphan drug in the EU must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Orphan drugs in the EU enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant for a similar medicinal product can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Healthcare and Privacy Regulation 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also govern our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate 
include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid; the FDCA and its implementing regulations, which prohibit, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated or misbranded; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a governmental healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (CCPA), went into operation on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, affords California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action related to certain data security breaches. These protections will be expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which was approved by California voters in November 2020 and will be operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. Similar legislative proposals have passed or are being advanced in other states, and Congress is considering additional federal privacy legislation. In addition, most healthcare professionals and facilities who may prescribe our products and from whom we may obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA). Although we are not considered to be a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA with respect to our clinical and commercial activities, we could be subject to penalties if we use or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including laws in all 50 states requiring security breach notification in some circumstances. The CCPA, CPRA, HIPAA and these other laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), could also apply to our operations. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with applicable privacy laws could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (PPACA) created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistance and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership interests held by such physicians and their immediate family during the previous calendar year.
Because our products are covered in the U.S. by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require us to pay substantial rebates or offer our drugs at substantial discounts to certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program (the 340B Program)). We are also required to discount our products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas and regulatory guidance, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources. Failure to properly calculate prices, or to offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our approved products and any future products of ours will depend, in part, on the extent to which their costs will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Each third-party payer may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover, the conditions under which it will cover such products, and how much it will pay for such products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product 
does not guarantee what reimbursement rate, if any, will be approved. Patients may be less likely to use our products if coverage is not provided and reimbursement may not cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.
In the U.S. and other potentially significant markets for our products, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which may result in lower average selling prices. In some cases, for example, third-party payers try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country-specific and national pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing coverage and/or reimbursement controls and measures, could have a material adverse impact on our net product revenues and results of operations.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign countries are considering proposals or have enacted legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. 
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. In particular, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation and rules, as well as executive orders, designed to, among other things: reduce or limit the prices of drugs and make them more affordable for patients (including, for example, by tying the prices that Medicare reimburses for physician-administered drugs to the prices of drugs in other countries); reform the structure and financing of Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits; implement additional data collection and transparency reporting regarding drug pricing, rebates, fees and other remuneration provided by drug manufacturers; enable the government to negotiate prices under Medicare; revise rules associated with the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price under Medicaid; eliminate the AKS discount safe harbor protection for manufacturer rebate arrangements with Medicare Part D plan sponsors; create new AKS safe harbors applicable to certain point-of-sale discounts to patients and fixed fee administrative fee payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers; and revise the rebate methodology under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. For instance, President Biden issued an executive order in July 2021 supporting legislation to enact some of these drug pricing reforms, and in response, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices in September 2021 with specific legislative and administrative policies that Congress could enact to help improve affordability of and access to prescription drugs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biotherapeutic product pricing, including restrictions on pricing or reimbursement at the state government level, limitations on discounts to patients, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, policies to encourage importation from other countries (subject to federal approval) and bulk purchasing, including the National Medicaid Pooling Initiative. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly impacted by major legislative initiatives and related political contests. For instance, efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA, some of which have been successful, create considerable uncertainties for all businesses involved in healthcare, including our own. In addition, there are pending federal and state-level legislative proposals that would significantly expand government-provided health insurance coverage, ranging from establishing a single-payer, national health insurance system to more limited “buy-in” options to existing public health insurance programs, each of which could have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. It is also possible that additional governmental actions will be taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and that such actions would have a significant impact on these public health insurance programs.
As a result of these developments and trends, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. These entities could refuse, limit or condition 
coverage for our products, such as by using tiered reimbursement or pressing for new forms of contracting, including, for example, the movement by insurers towards “value-based” contracting, any of which could adversely affect product sales. Due to general uncertainty in the current regulatory and healthcare policy environment, and specifically regarding positions that the Biden Administration may take with respect to these issues, we are unable to predict the impact of any legislative, regulatory, third-party payer or policy actions, including potential cost containment and healthcare reform measures.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before its cost may be funded within the respective national healthcare system. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, EU Member States may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national healthcare systems provide reimbursement and may control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profits the medicinal product generates for the company placing it on the market. Pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities or payers in EU Member States can take six to 12 months or longer after the initial marketing authorization is granted for a product, or after the marketing authorization for a new indication is granted. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, drug manufacturers and collaboration partners may also be required to conduct a study or otherwise provide data that seeks to establish the cost effectiveness of a new drug compared with other available established therapies. Other cost-control initiatives are similarly focused on affordability and accessibility, such as the Regulation on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) adopted in December 2021 and other upcoming legislative and policy changes aimed at increasing cooperation between EU Member States, and once enacted may further impact the price and reimbursement status of many medicinal products. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls, reimbursement limitations or other requirements for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products on cost-effectiveness grounds. Historically, products launched in EU Member States and other non-U.S. jurisdictions do not follow the price structures of the U.S., and they generally tend to be priced significantly lower.
Competition 
There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules, antibodies and other treatments for cancer. Our competitors and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, deeper regulatory expertise and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may afford them a competitive advantage.
Competition for Cabozantinib
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:
•efficacy, safety and reliability of cabozantinib, both alone and in combination with other therapies;
•timing and scope of regulatory approval;
•the speed at which we develop cabozantinib for the treatment of additional tumor types beyond its approved indications;
•our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib, both alone and in combination with other therapies;
•our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of cabozantinib product to the market;
•our ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib, both as a single agent and as part of any combination therapy regimen, and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement in approved indications;
•product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers;
•the level of our collaboration partners’ investments in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize cabozantinib, or any combination therapy regimen that includes cabozantinib, in territories where they are approved; 
•skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;
•protection of our intellectual property, including our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights against potential generic competition; and
•the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.
We believe that the quality and breadth of activity observed with cabozantinib, the skill of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees, our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and drug development are competitive strengths. However, many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do, more substantial capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and regulatory affairs.
Furthermore, the specific indications for which CABOMETYX is currently or may be approved, based on the results from clinical trials currently evaluating cabozantinib, are highly competitive. Several novel therapies and combinations of therapies have been approved, are in advanced stages of clinical development or are under expedited regulatory review in these indications, and these other therapies are currently competing or are expected to compete with CABOMETYX. While we have had success in adapting our development strategy for the cabozantinib franchise to address the competitive landscape, including through evaluation of therapies that combine ICIs with other targeted agents, it is uncertain whether current and future clinical trials, including those evaluating cabozantinib in combination with an ICI in HCC, NSCLC and mCRPC, will lead to regulatory approvals, or whether physicians will prescribe regimens containing cabozantinib instead of competing product combinations in approved indications. 
Below is a summary of the principal competition for cabozantinib in the indications for which it is approved or for which it has been or is currently being evaluated in potentially label-enabling trials, both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies. The information below does not include all competitor products, but rather those approved products that have or we believe may capture significant market share within their respective indications, or with respect to therapies still in development, those that are likely to overlap with patient populations that are or may be treated with cabozantinib or a combination therapy regimen that includes cabozantinib.
Competition in Approved Cabozantinib Indications
CABOMETYX - RCC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in advanced RCC includes: the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Pfizer’s axitinib; the combination of BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab; and the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib. Additionally, there are a variety of therapies being developed for advanced RCC, including: the combination of Peloton Therapeutics’ (a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co.) belzutifan (also known as MK-6482) and Eisai’s lenvatinib; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab, Eisai’s lenvatinib and Peloton Therapeutics’ belzutifan; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and quavonlimab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; and the combination of BMS’ nivolumab and Nektar’s bempegaldesleukin.
 The competitive landscape for RCC is evolving rapidly, especially given the entrance and increased adoption of ICI and ICI-TKI combination therapies into the RCC treatment landscape, particularly in the first-line setting. This has led to changing trends in prescribing and sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. It is difficult to predict how these changes will affect sales of CABOMETYX during 2022 and going forward.
CABOMETYX - HCC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in previously treated HCC includes: Bayer’s regorafenib; and Eisai’s lenvatinib. Additionally, there are a variety of therapies being developed for previously treated HCC, including the combination of Roche’s atezolizumab and either Eisai’s Lenvatinib or Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib.
The competitive landscape for HCC has significantly changed with the increased adoption of ICI combination therapies in the first-line setting, which may lead to an increase in prescribing and sequencing of TKIs in subsequent lines of therapy. It is difficult to predict how these changes will affect sales of CABOMETYX during 2022 and going forward.
CABOMETYX - DTC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in its previously treated DTC indication includes two treatments that are also approved for previously untreated DTC: Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib; and Eisai’s lenvatinib. In addition, we believe there is also competition for CABOMETYX from therapies approved to treat patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are RAI-refractory (if RAI is appropriate), including: Blueprint Medicine’s and Roche’s pralsetinib; and Loxo Oncology’s (a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly) selpercatinib.
Other than the approvals of RET inhibitors to treat certain DTC patients, there has been little change in the competitive landscape for RAI-refractory DTC treatments during recent years. Due the limited number of ongoing late-stage clinical trials in this DTC indication, we do not except additional competitors to emerge during 2022. 
COMETRIQ - MTC: We believe that the principal competing anti-cancer therapy to COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC is Genzyme’s vandetanib, which has been approved by the FDA and the EC for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease, as well as other therapies that have been recently approved to treat patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who require systemic therapy, including: Blueprint Medicine’s and Roche’s pralsetinib; and Loxo Oncology’s selpercatinib.
Other than the recent approvals of RET inhibitors to treat certain MTC patients, there has been little change in the treatment landscape for progressive, metastatic MTC during recent years, and due to the limited number of ongoing late-stage clinical trials in this indication, we do not expect many additional competitors to emerge in 2022. 
Competition in Potential Cabozantinib Indications
Cabozantinib in combination with ICI - HCC: COSMIC-312, the phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with previously untreated HCC, is continuing as planned to final analysis of OS, and we intend to submit an sNDA to the FDA for the combination regimen if supported by the final OS analysis. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced HCC, we believe its principal competition may include: the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; the combination of Roche’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab; and the combination of AstraZeneca’s durvalumab and tremelimumab.
Cabozantinib in combination with ICI – NSCLC: We are evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in CONTACT-01, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC, we believe its principal competition may include: Sanofi’s docetaxel; the combination of Sanofi’s docetaxel and Eli Lilly’s ramucirumab; the combination of BMS’ nivolumab and Mirati’s sitravatinib; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; Daiichi Sankyo’s DS-1062; and generic versions of docetaxel.
Cabozantinib in combination with ICI – mCRPC: We are evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in CONTACT-02, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with mCRPC who have been previously treated with one NHT. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with mCRPC, we believe its principal competition may include: Janssen Biotech’s (a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) abiraterone; Astellas Pharma’s and Pfizer’s enzalutamide; Sanofi’s docetaxel; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Sanofi’s docetaxel; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Astellas Pharma’s and Pfizer’s enzalutamide; the combination of BMS’ nivolumab and Sanofi’s docetaxel; Veru Pharma’s sabizabulin; and generic versions of abiraterone and docetaxel. In addition, we believe there may be competition for the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in mCRPC from therapies in late-stage development focused on the subset of mCRPC patients who are prostate-specific membrane antigen positive, including: Novartis’ 177Lu-PSMA-617; POINT Biopharma’s 177Lu-PNT2002; Telix International’s 177Lu-DOTA-rosopatamab; and Curium US LLC’s 177Lu-PSMA-I&T.
Competition for Cobimetinib and Esaxerenone
There is competition for both cobimetinib and esaxerenone in the specific indications and territories where they are approved, and there are regular new entrants and developments in all aspects of these markets. However, given the relatively lesser degree of adoption of these therapies within the broader markets in which they compete and their minimal contribution to our total revenues as out-licensed products, we do not believe changes in the competitive landscape in these indications will have a material impact on our business. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek patent protection in the U.S., EU and selected other foreign jurisdictions to cover our drug candidates and related technologies. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have numerous patents and pending patent applications that relate to methods of screening drug targets, compounds that modulate drug targets, as well as methods of making and using such compounds.
While many patent applications have been filed relating to the drug candidates that we have developed, the majority of these are not yet issued or allowed. To our knowledge, we own all global patents associated with cabozantinib and cobimetinib, and we either own or have in-licensed all global patents for our other drug candidates, as further described below.
Cabozantinib
Cabozantinib is covered by more than 15 issued patents in the U.S., building from U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,473, for the composition of matter of cabozantinib (the ‘473 Patent) and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. This composition of matter patent would expire in September 2024, but we have been granted a patent term extension to extend the term to August 2026. The following table describes the US patents that cover our marketed cabozantinib products, and which are listed in the Orange Book. Except as otherwise noted, the stated expiration dates include any patent term extensions already granted. In addition to the composition of matter patent referenced above, the table includes patents directed to, among other things, particular salts, polymorphs, formulations, or use of the compound in the treatment of specified diseases or conditions. We continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our cabozantinib products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.

Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise with respect to patents and patent applications required for the commercialization of medicines containing cabozantinib. For example, in September 2019, we received a Paragraph IV notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MSN), requesting approval to market a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets, which MSN then amended with additional Paragraph IV certifications in May 2020 to include the ‘473 Patent and U.S. Patent No. 8,497,284. In response, we filed patent infringement lawsuits against MSN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) in October 2019 and May 2020, which were later consolidated and include infringement claims related to the ‘473 Patent and U.S. Patent No. 8,497,284. In addition, in May 2021, we received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Teva Pharmaceuticals Development, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (individually and collectively referred to as Teva), requesting approval to market a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets. In response, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Teva, along with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Teva Parent), in the Delaware District Court in June 2021. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or provide assurance that these lawsuits will prevent the introduction of a generic version of CABOMETYX for any particular length of time, or at all. For a more detailed discussion of these litigation matters, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the EU, cabozantinib is protected by issued patents covering the composition of matter and methods of use. The issued patent would expire in September 2024, but we have applied for and either have obtained, or expect to obtain Supplementary Protection Certificates in the EU to extend the term to 2029. In addition to the composition of matter patent, the table below includes certain later-expiring patents directed to the commercial product, including, particular salts, polymorphs, formulations, or use of the compound in the treatment of specified diseases or conditions. 

Product | Patent No. | General Subject Matter | Patent Expiration
CABOMETYX | 2213661 | Composition of matter and methods of treatment | 2029 
2387563 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib and methods of treatment | 2030 
COMETRIQ | 2213661 | Composition of matter and methods of treatment | 2029 
2387563 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib and methods of treatment | 2030 

In September 2021, in a final decision before the Technical Board of Appeal, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office upheld the validity of EP patent 2387563, directed to crystalline forms of cabozantinib malate, pharmaceutical compositions and certain uses thereof. This ruling favors continuing exclusivity of our cabozantinib patent portfolio in the EU through the expiration date of EP patent 2387563 in 2030.
Similarly, in Japan, cabozantinib is protected by issued patents covering the composition of matter, and salts thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use, and Takeda has applied for patent term extension in Japan to extend the term to 2029. Foreign counterparts of the issued U.S. and European composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia and Canada and are anticipated to expire in 2024. We have other filed patent applications and issued patents in the U.S. and other selected countries covering certain synthetic methods, salts, polymorphs, formulations, prodrugs, metabolites and combinations of cabozantinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire as late as 2037. Outside the U.S. and Japan, cabozantinib is licensed to Ipsen, and in Japan, cabozantinib is licensed to Takeda, each in accordance with the respective collaboration agreements. A discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and other proprietary rights is set forth in “Risk Factors,” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Drug Candidates
We also have issued patents and pending patent applications, and will continue to file new patent applications, in the U.S., the EU and other selected countries covering our other drug candidates in clinical and/or preclinical development, including XL092, XB002, XL102 and XL114.
We have obtained licenses from various parties that give us rights to technologies that we deem to be necessary or desirable for our research and development. These licenses (both exclusive and non-exclusive) may require us to pay royalties as well as upfront and milestone payments.
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We also require all of our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive proprietary information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all proprietary information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Furthermore, our agreements with employees and, in most circumstances, our agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors expressly provide that all inventions, concepts, developments, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property developed by an employee during the employment period, or developed by a service provider during the service period or utilizing our proprietary drugs or information, shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Human Capital Management
Our Employees and Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
As of December 31, 2021, we had 954 full-time equivalent employees, representing a 23% increase in our employee workforce as compared to December 31, 2020. Of these employees, 509 are members of our various research and development teams and 445 are members of our various commercial and general and administrative teams. Of these employees, 149 hold Ph.D. degrees, 19 hold M.D. (or foreign equivalent) degrees, 30 hold PharmD degrees and 88 hold other professional degrees such as a J.D. or M.B.A. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
During the past five years, our employee turnover has remained consistently below average for the U.S. life sciences industry generally. Given our expanding operations and need to further grow our headcount to support our business, we continually assess employee turnover, recruitment initiatives, compensation and benefits programs, safety in performing critical laboratory work, diversity and other matters relevant to human capital management, and we review results with our Board of Directors on a periodic basis.
We are an equal opportunity employer and maintain policies that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital and veteran status. We are proud to employ a diverse workforce that, as of December 31, 2021, was 55% non-white and 53% women. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, 50% of our positions that manage other employees directly were held by non-whites and 47% were held by women, and after giving effect to the hiring of our new Chief Medical Officer in January 2022, women made up 33% of our senior leadership team. We strive to build and nurture a culture where all employees feel empowered to be their authentic selves. We respect and appreciate each employee’s unique perspective and experiences, and value their contributions to our mission. It is important that we celebrate, encourage and support similarities and differences to drive innovation for the benefit of our employees, patients and community.
Culture, Compensation and Benefits
At Exelixis, we value being exceptional in what we do and how we lead, excelling for patients by going the extra mile to care for them and exceeding together as a business and contributor to the scientific community. We strive to live these values every day across the company, integrating them into everything from our interview, hiring and onboarding processes, to our performance evaluation, rewards and promotion programs.
We provide generous compensation packages designed to attract and retain high-quality employees, and all of our employees are eligible for cash bonuses and grants of equity awards. We regularly evaluate our compensation programs with an independent compensation consultant and utilize industry benchmarking in an effort to ensure they are competitive compared to similar biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies with which we compete for talent, as well as fair and equitable across our workforce with respect to gender, race and other personal characteristics. In addition, we are proud to provide a variety of programs and services to help employees meet and balance their needs at work, at home and in life, including an attractive mix of healthcare, insurance and other benefit plans. We deliver a benefits program that is designed to keep our employees and their families healthy, which includes not only medical, dental and vision benefits, but also dependent care, mental health and other wellness benefits. For a discussion of workplace safety measures we have taken, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “—Environmental, Health and Safety.”
Beyond compensation and benefits, we also value career development for all employees, and we offer a tuition reimbursement program, as well as professional development courses ranging from technical training, competency-based workshops and leadership development programs facilitated by external partners who are experts in their respective fields. Direct managers also take an active role in identifying individualized development plans to assist their employees in realizing their full potential and creating opportunities for promotions and added responsibilities that enhance the engagement and retention of our workforce.
