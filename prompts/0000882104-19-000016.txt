ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
Overview
In this report all references to “PDL,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean collectively PDL BioPharma, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the term means only PDL BioPharma, Inc.
We seek to provide a significant return for our stockholders by acquiring commercial stage pharmaceutical assets with multiple year revenue growth potential as well as late clinical stage pharmaceutical products. Our leadership team has extensive experience in acquiring, commercializing and managing the life cycle of therapeutic products domestically and internationally across a number of indications and modalities. We intend to leverage this experience by pursuing the acquisition, growth and potential monetization of pharmaceutical products and companies.
Historically, we generated a substantial portion of our revenues through the license agreements related to patents covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as the Queen et al. patents. In 2012, we began providing alternative sources of capital through royalty monetizations and debt facilities, and, in 2016, we began acquiring commercial-stage products and launching specialized companies dedicated to the commercialization of these products. To date, we have consummated seventeen such transactions, the following ten of which are active and outstanding:

1 | Noden Pharma DAC and Noden Pharma USA, Inc. (together, and including their respective subsidiaries, “Noden”).


2 | DFM ceased operations in December 2016 and we subsequently foreclosed upon and obtained most of the assets of DFM and impaired them by $51.1 million. Since taking over the DFM assets, we have collected $8.7 million in cash and, as of December 31, 2018 an intangible asset with a carrying value of $1.6 million remains on our books. For further detail see Note 9, Notes and Other Long-term Receivables, and Note 13, Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.


3 | Wellstat Diagnostics, LLC (also known as Defined Diagnostic, LLC) (“Wellstat Diagnostics”).


4 | Assertio Therapeutics, Inc., formerly Depomed, Inc. Hereafter referred to as “Assertio”.


5 | Excludes transaction costs.

Based on the composition of our existing investment portfolio, we currently operate in three segments designated as Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices and Income Generating Assets. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment consists of revenue derived from branded prescription medicine products sold under the name Tekturna® and Tekturna HCT® in the United States, and Rasilez® and Rasilez HCT® in the rest of the world (collectively, the “Noden Products”). Our Medical Devices segment consists of revenue derived from the LENSAR® Laser System sales. Our Income Generating Assets segment consists of revenue derived from (i) notes and other long-term receivables, (ii) royalty rights and hybrid notes/royalty receivables, (iii) equity investments and (iv) royalties from issued patents in the United States and elsewhere covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as the Queen et al. patents. 
4

Prospectively, we expect to focus on the acquisition and development of additional pharmaceutical products and companies with revenue growth potential. We anticipate that over time, as a result of these new acquisitions, more of our revenues will come from our Pharmaceutical segment and less of our revenues will come from our Income Generating Assets and Medical Devices segments.
Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and our total assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in Item 8.
Pharmaceutical
Our goal is to deliver market-leading shareholder value through the acquisition, growth and potential monetization of a portfolio of actively managed pharmaceutical assets. We are focused on acquiring (1) commercial-stage assets with multiple year revenue growth potential and (2) late clinical stage pharmaceutical products. In both instances, our acquisition strategy focuses on our ability to add value to these assets by giving them access to our capital and commercialization expertise. We have a leadership team with a proven track record of consummating deals and putting businesses on the path to growth and profitability, and we have a strong, liquid balance sheet that can be deployed to finance the right transactions. Our goal is to build growing, profitable revenues from a balanced portfolio of operating companies’ cash flows and, when appropriate, to capture further market value through optimally timed exit strategies.
Noden
On July 1, 2016, our subsidiary, Noden Pharma DAC, entered into an asset purchase agreement (“Noden Purchase Agreement”) whereby it purchased from Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, market, and sell the Noden Products and certain related assets and assumed certain related liabilities (the “Noden Transaction”). Upon the consummation of the Noden Transaction, a noncontrolling interest holder acquired a 6% equity interest in Noden. We purchased the equity interest of the noncontrolling interest holder in May 2017. For details regarding the Noden Transaction see Note 23, Business Combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Tekturna (or Rasilez outside of the United States) contains aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, for the treatment of hypertension. While indicated as a first line treatment, it is more commonly used as a third line treatment in those patients who are intolerant of angiotensin-receptor blockers (“ARBs”) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (“ACEIs”). Studies indicate that approximately 12% of hypertension patients are ARB/ACEI inhibitor-intolerant. It is not indicated for use with ARBs and ACEIs in patients with diabetes or renal impairment and is contraindicated for use by pregnant women. On March 4, 2019, we announced the U.S commercial launch of an authorized generic of Tekturna, aliskiren hemifumarate 150 mg and 300 mg tablets with the same drug formulation as Tekturna. The launch is being carried out by Prasco, LLC d/b/a Prasco Laboratories.
Tekturna HCT is a combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, for the treatment of hypertension in patients not adequately controlled by monotherapy and as an initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. It is not indicated for use with ACEIs and ARBs in patient with diabetes or renal impairment, or for use in patients with known anuria or hypersensitivity to sulfonamide derived drugs and is contraindicated for use by pregnant women.
The agreement between Novartis and Noden provides for various transition periods for development and commercialization activities relating to the Noden Products. Initially, Novartis distributed the Noden Products on behalf of Noden worldwide and Noden received a profit transfer on such sales. Generally, the profit transfer to Noden was defined as gross revenues less product cost and a low single digit percentage fee to Novartis. The profit transfer terminated upon the transfer of the marketing authorization from Novartis to Noden in each country. In the United States, the duration of the profit transfer ran from July 1, 2016 through October 4, 2016. Outside the United States, the profit transfer ended in the first quarter of 2018. Prior to the transfer of the marketing authorization, revenue was presented on a “net” basis; after the transfer of the marketing authorization, revenue is presented on a “gross” basis, meaning product costs are reported separately and there is no fee to Novartis.
Intellectual Property
The Noden Products are protected by multiple patents worldwide, which specifically cover the composition of matter, the pharmaceutical formulations and methods of production. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Orange Book lists one patent, U.S. patent No. 5,559,111 (the “’111 Patent”), which covers compositions of matter comprising aliskiren. The ‘111 Patent expired on January 21, 2019, and was previously extended for six months through a pediatric extension. In 
5

addition, the FDA Orange Book for Tekturna lists U.S. Patent No. 8,617,595 (the “’595 Patent”), which covers certain compositions comprising aliskiren, together with other formulation components, and will expire on February 19, 2026. 
On June 12, 2017, our subsidiary Noden Pharma DAC (“Noden DAC”) filed a complaint against Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Anchen”) and Par Pharmaceutical (“Par”) for infringement of the ‘595 Patent based on their submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDA”) seeking authorization from the FDA to market a generic version of aliskiren hemifumarate tablets, 150 mg and 300 mg, in the United States. Noden DAC’s suit triggered a 30-month stay of FDA approval of that application under the Hatch Waxman Act. Par filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that their proposed generic version of aliskiren hemifumarate hydrochlorothiazide tablets (150 mg eq. base/12.5 mg HCT, 150 mg eq. base/25 mg HCT, 300 mg eq. base/12.5 mg HCT, and 300 mg eq. base/25 mg HCT), described in a separate ANDA submitted by Par to FDA, alleging noninfringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,618,172 (the “’172 Patent”), also owned by Noden DAC. This case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In March 2018, each of the parties to the proceeding filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of the defendants’ counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of the ‘172 Patent. In the stipulation, Anchen and Par agreed that they will not seek, or otherwise join or assist in, any post-grant review, including inter partes review, of the ‘172 Patent or U.S. Patent No. 9,023,893 (the “’893 Patent”). The defendants further stipulated that they will not seek marketing approval of Par’s ANDA or submit any other ANDA seeking approval to market aliskiren hemifumarate hydrochlorothiazide prior to the expiration of the ‘172 Patent in July of 2028. Both the ‘172 Patent and the ‘893 Patent are listed in the Orange Book for Tekturna HCT.
On June 8, 2018, Noden and Anchen entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”). Under the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to file a stipulation of dismissal with the court to facilitate dismissal of the litigation in its entirety, with prejudice. In the Settlement Agreement, Noden granted Anchen a non-exclusive, royalty free, fully paid up and non-transferable license to manufacture and commercialize in the United States a generic version of aliskiren which is described in Anchen’s ANDA, and Anchen agreed not to commercialize its generic version of aliskiren prior to March 1, 2019. The license grant excludes certain formulations covered by the ‘595 Patent which closely relate to the commercial formulation of Tekturna marketed by Noden. The Settlement Agreement includes a release by each party for liabilities associated with the litigation and an acknowledgment from Anchen that the ‘595 Patent claims are valid and enforceable. 
As a result of the Settlement Agreement and the increased probability of a generic version of aliskiren being launched in the United States, management evaluated the ongoing value of the Noden DAC asset group and concluded that the Noden DAC acquired product rights and customer relationship long-lived assets, with a carrying amount of $192.5 million, were no longer recoverable and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of $40.1 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $152.3 million in the second quarter of 2018.
The FDA Orange Book for Tekturna HCT lists U.S. patent No. 8,618,172, which covers certain compositions comprising aliskiren, together with other formulation components, and will expire on July 13, 2028. In Europe, European patent No. 678 503B (the “’503B Patent”) expired in 2015. However, numerous Supplementary Protection Certificates (“SPCs”) have been granted which are based on the ‘503B Patent and which will provide for extended protection. These SPCs generally expire in April of 2020. European Patent Publication Number 2 305 232 (the “’232 Patent”), currently pending before the European Patent Office, has received a positive indication of allowability. The ‘232 Patent covers certain pharmaceutical compositions comprising aliskiren and HCT and, if granted, will expire in 2021. The Company intends to file applications with selected national patent offices for the grant of SPCs which, if granted, would extend the date of expiration for up to five years.
Manufacturing
Noden and Novartis entered into a supply agreement pursuant to which Novartis will manufacture and supply to Noden a bulk tableted form of the Noden Products, and for the additional supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) form, for specified periods of time prior to the transfer of manufacturing responsibilities for the Noden Products to another manufacturer. This arrangement is covered by a long-term supply agreement in effect through November 2020. For additional details regarding the supply agreement, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. To date, Novartis has met our manufacturing requirements and we expect that it is capable of providing sufficient quantities of the Noden Products to meet anticipated demands. We have contracted with an additional third-party located outside of the United States for the manufacture of Noden products once the agreement with Novartis expires.
Sales and Distribution
In anticipation of the commercialization of Anchen’s generic version of aliskiren and in order to optimize profitability, in the third quarter of 2018, Noden discontinued its direct sales force and transitioned to a non-personal promotion strategy.
6

We entered into an arrangement with a third-party logistics provider to distribute the Noden Products within the United States on our behalf. The Noden Products are sold directly to wholesalers from a distribution center owned by the third-party logistics provider.
As of December 31, 2018, the Noden Products were distributed in 13 countries outside of the United States. During 2018, we ceased distribution of the Noden Products in several European countries where they were not profitable or had extremely low gross margins. 
The pharmaceutical industry’s largest wholesale distributors, Amerisource Bergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., accounted for 15.4%, 17.0% and 13.2%, respectively, of our total net pharmaceutical sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 19.8%, 22.2% and 15.0%, respectively, of our total net pharmaceutical sales for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid innovation and intense competition which is applicable to the therapeutic area our Noden Products are approved. The Noden Products are direct renin inhibitors approved for the treatment of hypertension. They compete against a number of classes of treatments including changes in diet, exercise, thiazide diuretics, ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, cardioselective beta blockers, alpha blockers, direct vasodilators and centrally acting agents. With the exception of diet and exercise, there are numerous drugs within each of the classes enumerated above, most of which have generic versions that are less expensive than Tekturna and Tekturna HCT. Physicians may also treat hypertension patients by combining one or more of the enumerated classes of treatments. Diet, thiazide diuretics, ACEIs, ARBs and calcium channel blockers are most commonly used as first line treatments for hypertension and dominate the market, in part, because of the availability of low cost generics in each category. Renin inhibitors, such as Tekturna and Tekturna HCT which are the only approved direct renin inhibitors, and beta blockers are used thereafter followed by direct vasodilators, central acting agents and alpha blockers. Tekturna and Tekturna HCT are generally perceived as alternatives for patients who do not respond to, or are intolerant of, the first line therapies. As noted above, on March 4, 2019, we announced the U.S. commercial launch of an authorized generic of Tekturna, aliskiren hemifumarate 150 mg and 300 mg tablets with the same drug formulation as Tekturna.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 20 full-time employees at Noden, who manage its business and operations.
Medical Devices
LENSAR
In December 2016, LENSAR filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Chapter 11 case”). With our support, LENSAR filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization under which LENSAR would issue 100% of its equity interests to us in exchange for the cancellation of our claims as a secured creditor in the Chapter 11 case. On May 11, 2017, pursuant to the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, most of LENSAR’s outstanding debt owed to us was converted to equity and LENSAR became our wholly-owned operating subsidiary (“the LENSAR Transaction”). For additional details regarding the LENSAR, the LENSAR Transaction and the Chapter 11 case, see Note 23, Business Combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
LENSAR is a medical device company focused on the next generation femtosecond cataract laser technology for refractive cataract surgery. Femtosecond cataract surgery uses advanced laser technology as compared to conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery which uses an ultrasonic device. Cataract surgery is the highest volume surgical procedure performed worldwide with over 27 million surgeries estimated to have been performed in 2018, the majority of which use the conventional phacoemulsification technique. The LENSAR® Laser System offers cataract surgeons automation and customization for their astigmatism treatment planning and other essential steps of the refractive cataract surgery procedure with the highest levels of precision, accuracy, and efficiency. These features assist surgeons in managing their astigmatism treatment plans for optimal overall visual outcomes.
The LENSAR® Laser System has been approved by the FDA for anterior capsulotomy, lens fragmentation, corneal and arcuate incisions. The LENSAR Laser with Augmented Reality™ provides an accurate 3-D model of the relevant anatomical features of each patient’s anterior segment, allowing precise laser delivery and to enhance the surgical confidence in performing accurate 
7

corneal incisions, precise size, shape and location of free-floating capsulotomies, and efficient lens fragmentation for all grades. The LENSAR® Laser System - fs 3D (LLS-fs 3D) with Streamline™ includes the integration with various pre-op diagnostic devices, automated Iris Registration with automatic cyclorotation adjustment, IntelliAxis-C™ (corneal) and IntelliAxis-L™ (lens) markers for simple alignment without errors associated with manually marking the eye, of Toric IOLs as well as treatment planning tools for precision guided laser treatments. The corneal incision-only mode, expanded remote diagnostics capabilities, additional pre-programmable preferences, thoughtful ergonomics, and up to 20 seconds faster laser treatment times with Streamline allow for seamless integration and maximum surgical efficiency.
Intellectual Property
LENSAR has developed the LENSAR® Laser System, which is the only femtosecond cataract laser built specifically for refractive cataract surgery. The LENSAR® Laser System is protected by over 60 granted patents in the United States and rest of the world and over 45 pending patent applications in the United States and rest of the world.
Manufacturing
Through our LENSAR subsidiary, we currently manufacture our LENSAR® Laser System at a facility in Orlando, Florida.
LENSAR purchases both custom and off-the-shelf components from a small number of suppliers and subjects them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of the LENSAR® Laser System are currently provided by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). LENSAR purchases the majority of its components and major assemblies through purchase orders with limited long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods.
LENSAR has entered into various supply agreements for the manufacture and supply of certain components. The supply agreements commit LENSAR to a minimum purchase obligation of approximately $3.8 million over the next twenty-four months of which $3.5 million is due in the next 12 months. LENSAR expects to meet these requirements.
Sales and Distribution
LENSAR markets and sells the LENSAR® Laser System to ophthalmic ambulatory surgical centers, specialty ophthalmic hospitals and multi-specialty hospitals in the United States through a direct sales force. Outside of the United States, LENSAR typically sells the LENSAR® Laser System through distributors. Two distributors in Asia each represent 12% of the net sales in our Medical Devices segment for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Competition
The LENSAR® Laser System is a femtosecond cataract laser for refractive cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is the highest volume surgical procedure globally, with 27 million cataract surgeries estimated to have been performed in 2018. We estimate that the market penetration of femtosecond cataract laser surgery is approximately 10.6% of total procedures in the United States, while approximately 2.8% of the total cataract surgeries performed globally. We believe femtosecond cataract laser procedures are expected to grow approximately 7.5% annually through 2023.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 67 full-time employees at LENSAR, who manage its business and operations.
Income Generating Assets
We have pursued income generating assets when such assets can be acquired on terms that we believe allow us to increase return to our stockholders. The income generating assets typically consist of (i) notes and other long-term receivables, (ii) royalty rights and hybrid notes/royalty receivables, (iii) equity investments and (iv) royalties from the Queen et. Al patents. We focus our income generating asset acquisition strategy on commercial-stage therapies and medical devices having strong economic fundamentals. However, our acquired income generating assets will not, in the near term, replace completely the revenues we generated from our license agreements related to our Queen et al. patents. In the second quarter of 2016, our revenues materially decreased after we stopped receiving payments from certain Queen et al. patent licenses and legal settlements, which accounted for 2%, 11% and 68% of our 2018, 2017 and 2016 total revenues.
8

Notes and Other Long-Term Receivables
We have entered into credit agreements with borrowers across the healthcare industry, under which we make available cash loans to be used by the borrower. Obligations under these credit agreements are typically secured by a pledge of substantially all the assets of the borrower and any of its subsidiaries. While we currently maintain this portfolio of notes receivable, our intention is to pursue fewer of these transactions. As of December 31, 2018, we had two notes receivable transactions outstanding, CareView and Wellstat Diagnostics, which are summarized below:
CareView
Technology
CareView is a provider of products and on-demand application services for the healthcare industry by specializing in bedside video monitoring, archiving and patient care documentation systems and patient entertainment services.
Deal Summary
In June 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with CareView, whereby we made available to CareView up to $40.0 million in loans comprised of two tranches of $20.0 million each, subject to CareView’s attainment of specified milestones and under which we have a security interest in substantially all of CareView’s assets. In October 2015, we and CareView entered into an amendment of the credit agreement to modify certain definitions related to the first and second tranche milestones and we funded the first tranche of $20.0 million, net of fees, based on CareView’s attainment of the first milestone, as amended. The second $20.0 million tranche was not funded due to CareView’s failure to meet the funding milestone and we have no further funding obligation at this time. The outstanding borrowing under the credit agreement bears interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum payable quarterly in arrears. Principal repayment was to commence on the ninth quarterly interest payment date in equal installments until final maturity of the loan in October 2020. 
In February 2018, we entered into a modification agreement with CareView (the “February 2018 Modification Agreement”) whereby we agreed, effective as of December 28, 2017, to modify the credit agreement before remedies could otherwise have become available to us under the credit agreement in relation to certain obligations of CareView that would potentially not be met, including the requirement to make principal payments. Under the February 2018 Modification Agreement, we agreed that (i) a lower liquidity covenant would be applicable and (ii) principal repayment would be delayed for a period of up to December 31, 2018. In exchange for agreeing to these modifications, among other things, the exercise price of our warrants to purchase 4.4 million shares of common stock of CareView was reduced and, subject to the occurrence of certain events, CareView agreed to grant us additional equity interests. In September 2018, we entered into an amendment to the February 2018 Modification Agreement with CareView whereby we agreed, effective as of September 28, 2018, that a lower liquidity covenant would be applicable.
In December 2018, the Company further modified the loan by agreeing that (i) a lower liquidity covenant would be applicable, (ii) the principal repayment would be deferred until January 31, 2019, and (iii) the scheduled interest payment due on December 31, 2018 would be deferred until January 31, 2019. The principal repayment and interest payment were subsequently deferred until March 31, 2019 under additional amendments.
Wellstat Diagnostics
Technology
Wellstat Diagnostics is a private company formerly dedicated to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of small point of care diagnostic systems.
Deal Summary
In March 2012, we executed a $7.5 million two-year senior secured note receivable with the holders of the equity interests in Wellstat Diagnostics. In August 2012, we and Wellstat Diagnostics amended the note receivable, providing a senior secured note receivable of $10.0 million, bearing interest at 12% per annum, to replace the original $7.5 million 
9

note receivable. This $10.0 million note receivable was repaid on November 2, 2012, using the proceeds of the $40.0 million credit facility we entered into on the same date.
In November 2012, we entered into a $40.0 million credit agreement with Wellstat Diagnostics pursuant to which we were to accrue quarterly interest payments at the rate of 5% per annum. In January 2013, Wellstat Diagnostics defaulted on the credit agreement, and as a result both parties agreed to enter into a forbearance agreement whereby we agreed to provide additional funding. In August 2013, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with terms substantially the same as those of the original credit agreement. However, pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement the principal amount was reset to approximately $44.1 million.
During 2015, 2016 and 2017, we, Wellstat Diagnostics, and Samuel J. Wohlstadter, Nadine H. Wohlstadter, Duck Farm, Inc., Hebron Valley Farms, Inc., HVF, Inc., Hyperion Catalysis EU Limited, Hyperion, NHW, LLC, Wellstat AVT Investment, LLC, Wellstat Biocatalysis, LLC, Wellstat Biologics Corporation, Wellstat Diagnostics, Wellstat Immunotherapeutics, LLC, Wellstat Management Company, LLC, Wellstat Ophthalmics Corporation, Wellstat Therapeutics Corporation, Wellstat Therapeutics EU Limited, Wellstat Vaccines, LLC and SJW Properties, Inc., the guarantors of Wellstat Diagnostics’ obligations to us (collectively, the “Wellstat Diagnostics Guarantors”) were involved in a series of legal actions. A further discussion of the Wellstat litigation is included in Note 25, Legal Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Royalty Rights - At Fair Value
We have entered into various royalty purchase agreements with counterparties, whereby the counterparty conveys to us the right to receive royalties that are typically payable on sales revenue generated by the sale, distribution or other use of the counterparties’ products. Certain of our royalty agreements provide the counterparty with the right to repurchase the royalty rights at any time for a specified amount.
We record the royalty rights at fair value using discounted cash flows related to the expected future cash flows to be received. We use significant judgment in determining our valuation inputs, including estimates as to the probability and timing of future sales of the licensed product. A third-party expert is generally engaged to assist us with the development of our estimate of the expected future cash flows. The estimated fair value of the asset is subject to variation should those cash flows vary significantly from our estimates. At each reporting period, an evaluation is performed to assess those estimates, discount rates utilized and general market conditions affecting fair market value.
While we currently maintain this portfolio of royalty rights, our intention is to no longer pursue these transactions while we focus on acquiring additional pharmaceutical products or companies.
At December 31, 2018, we had a total of five royalty rights transactions outstanding, which are summarized below in chronological order:
Assertio (formerly Depomed)
Deal Summary
In October 2013, we entered into a Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Assertio Royalty Agreement”) with Assertio, whereby we acquired the rights to receive royalties and milestones payable on sales of five Type 2 diabetes products licensed by Assertio in exchange for a $240.5 million cash payment.
In August 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assertio Royalty Agreement pursuant to which we purchased Assertio’s remaining interests in royalty and milestone payments payable on sales of Type 2 diabetes products licensed by Assertio for $20.0 million.
The Assertio Royalty Agreement terminates on the third anniversary following the date upon which the later of the following occurs: (a) October 25, 2021, or (b) at such time as no royalty payments remain payable under any license agreement and each of the license agreements has expired by its terms.
10

Technology
The rights acquired include Assertio’s royalty and milestone payments accruing from and after October 1, 2013: (a) from Santarus, Inc. (“Santarus”), which was subsequently acquired by Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Salix”), which itself was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (“Valeant”), which, in July 2018 changed its name to Bausch Health Companies Inc. (hereafter referred to as “Bausch Health”) with respect to sales of Glumetza® (metformin HCL extended-release tablets) in the United States; (b) from Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) with respect to sales of Janumet XR® (sitagliptin and metformin HCL extended-release); (c) from Janssen Pharmaceuticals N.V. (“Janssen Pharmaceuticals”) with respect to potential future development milestones and sales of its fixed-dose combination of Invokana® (canagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor) and extended-release metformin tablets, marketed as Invokamet XR®; (d) from Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (“Boehringer Ingelheim”) and Eli Lilly & Company (“Eli Lilly”) with respect to potential development milestones and sales of the fixed-dose combinations of drugs and extended-release metformin subject to Assertio’s license agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim including its approved products, Jentadueto XR® and Synjardy XR®; and (e) from LG Life Sciences and Bausch Health for sales of extended-release metformin in Korea and Canada, respectively.
On May 31, 2016, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly announced that the FDA approved Jentadueto XR (a fixed dose combination of Linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and extended-release metformin tablets) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults, which will be marketed by both companies. This approval triggered the payment of a milestone to us of $6.0 million. On September 21, 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA approved Invokamet XR for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. This approval triggered the payment of a milestone to us of $5.0 million. On December 13, 2016, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly announced that the FDA approved Synjardy® XR (a fixed dose combination of Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and extended-release metformin tablets) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults, which will be marketed by both companies. This approval triggered the payment of a milestone to us of $6.0 million. In 2017, we started to receive royalties on the net sales of these three newly approved products.
In February 2013, a generic equivalent to Glumetza was approved by the FDA and in August of 2016, two additional generic equivalents to Glumetza were approved to enter the U.S. market. In February 2016, Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in August 2017, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and in July 2018, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Inc. each launched a generic equivalent approved product.
In May 2017, we received notification that a subsidiary of Valeant had launched an authorized generic equivalent product in February 2017, and we received royalties on such authorized generic equivalent product under the same terms as the branded Glumetza product, retroactive to February 2017.

Royalties from Queen et al. patents
Historically, we generated a substantial portion of our revenues through the license agreements related to patents covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as the Queen et al. patents. While the Queen et al. royalty revenue has dropped substantially since the first quarter of 2016, we continued to receive royalty revenue in 2018 from one product under the Queen et al. patent licenses, Tysabri®, as a result of sales of the product that was manufactured prior to patent expiry. In November 2017, we were notified by Biogen Inc. (“Biogen”) that product supply for Tysabri® that was manufactured prior to patent expiry, and for which we would receive royalties on, had been extinguished in the United States and was rapidly being reduced in other countries. As a result, royalties from product sales of Tysabri were substantially lower in 2018 and no additional royalties are expected in 2019. Our total revenues from licensees under our Queen et al. patents were $4.5 million, $36.4 million and $166.2 million, net of rebates and foreign exchange hedge adjustments, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Licensing Agreements for Marketed Products
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received royalties on sales of Tysabri from Biogen, and in the year ended December 31, 2016, we also received royalties on sales of the six humanized antibody products listed below from Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”).
Biogen
We entered into a patent license agreement, effective April 24, 1998, under which we granted to Elan Corporation, plc (“Elan”) a license under our Queen et al. patents to make, use and sell antibodies that bind to the cellular adhesion molecule á4 in patients with multiple sclerosis. Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive a flat royalty rate in the low, single digits based on Elan’s net sales of the Tysabri product. This license agreement entitles us to royalties following the expiration of our patents with respect to sales of licensed product manufactured prior to patent expiry in jurisdictions providing patent protection. In April 2013, Biogen completed its purchase of Elan’s interest in Tysabri, and in connection with such purchase all obligations under our patent license agreement with Elan were assumed by Biogen.
In November 2017, we were notified by Biogen that product supply that was manufactured prior to patent expiry, and for which we would receive royalties on, had been extinguished in the United States and was rapidly being reduced in other countries. This resulted in a reduction in royalties from product sales of Tysabri, and royalties were substantially lower in 2018 and no additional royalties are expected.
Genentech
We entered into a master patent license agreement, effective September 25, 1998, under which we granted Genentech a license under our Queen et al. patents to make, use and sell certain antibody products.
On January 31, 2014, we entered into the Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Genentech and F. Hoffman LaRoche, Ltd. (“Roche”) that resolved all existing legal disputes between the parties.
The Settlement Agreement precluded Genentech and Roche from challenging the validity of our patents, including our SPCs in Europe, from contesting their obligation to pay royalties to us, from contesting patent coverage for Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, Xolair, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Gazyva® (collectively, the “Genentech Products”) and from assisting or encouraging any third-party in challenging our patents and SPCs. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we ceased receiving any revenue from Genentech after the first quarter of 2016.
Major Customers
In 2016, Genentech accounted for 43% of our total revenues. It did not account for any of our revenues in 2018 or 2017. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, Biogen accounted for 2%, 11%, and 24% of our total revenues, respectively.
Competition
The underlying products associated with our income generating assets compete with existing products and are vulnerable to new branded or generic entrants in the marketplace.

Governmental Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical and medical device products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals and medical devices are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) governs the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical and medical device products, and with respect to biologics, compliance with the Public Health Service Act is also required. There are also comparable laws and regulations that apply at the state level and in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. 
Regulation of Pharmaceuticals in the United States
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.

14


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has 60 days to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically 
15

issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Moreover, after approval of an NDA, a company may decide to launch an “authorized generic” version of the drug, which is an approved brand name drug that is marketed without the brand name on its label. Other than the fact that it does not have the brand name on its label, it is the exact same drug product as the branded product. While a separate NDA is not required for marketing an authorized generic, the FDA requires that the NDA holder notify the FDA if it markets an authorized generic. The NDA holder may market both the authorized generic and the brand-name product at the same time.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including, but not limited to, fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds 60 days to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
16

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Medical Devices Regulation in the United States
Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, unless exempt. A Class III product is a product which has a new intended use or uses advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Our current medical device products are classified Class II medical devices.
17

When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either: a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, and for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications, or PMAs, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the FDA may deny the request for clearance. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. We have modified aspects of some of our devices since receiving regulatory clearance and we have made the determination that new 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals were not required.
Although unlikely for the types of medical devices marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, including extensive technical and manufacturing data and data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA will usually be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA as well as the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites, and the informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial is obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy.
In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may 
18

present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject.
Foreign Regulation of Drugs and Medical Devices 
In order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory authorizations or approvals in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.
Foreign Regulation of Drugs
In order to market drug products in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the European Union and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
Foreign Regulation of Medical Devices
Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformité Européenne (“CE”) mark, for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries which accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of 
19

the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer’s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, an accredited certification body, should carry out unannounced audits, at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer’s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer).
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
We are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include, without limitation: foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the DHHS issued regulations in July 1991, which the Department has referred to as “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (described below).
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $74,792 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to ten years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act.
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. On May 20, 2009, the 
20

Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA, was enacted, which modifies and clarifies certain provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act. In part, the FERA amends the federal civil False Claims Act such that penalties may now apply to any person, including an organization that does not contract directly with the government, who knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid in part by the federal government. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
The federal Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Also, many US states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interest may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”). Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain foreign countries and US states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
Coverage and reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products or the products for which we receive royalty revenue unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost. Sales of any products therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or device product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a 
21

third-party payor not to cover our products could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or device product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
The reimbursement to the facility from third-party payors is intended to cover the overall cost of treatment, including the cost of our devices used during the procedure as well as the overhead cost associated with the facility where the procedure is performed. We do not directly bill any third-party payors; instead, we receive payment from the hospital or other facility that uses our devices. Failure by physicians, hospitals, and other users of our devices to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our devices are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.
In addition, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and other facilities for procedures during which our devices are used. Because the cost of our devices generally is recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed, these updates could directly impact the demand for our devices. An example of such payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, with respect to reimbursement for physician services under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. 
The containment of healthcare costs is a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or device products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting, and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act, (the “ACA”), in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the United States that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020. The ACA also provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the ACA will have on our business.
There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Moreover, the Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement.
22

Moreover, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our licensees, borrowers or royalty-agreement counterparties. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s cGMP requirements, which for medical devices, are contained in its QSR and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the United States. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer’s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the United States, and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. In the United States, routine FDA inspections usually occur every two years, and may occur more often for cause.
To a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third-party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support, and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries. In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Products manufactured outside the United States by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the United States. We must demonstrate compliance of such products to U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 18 full-time employees managing our intellectual property, acquisitions, operations and other corporate activities, including providing management oversight, accounting, legal and tax support and administrative assistance to our subsidiaries, as well as performing certain essential functions of a public company. In addition, we had 87 full-time employees at our operating subsidiaries, Noden and LENSAR, who manage the subsidiaries’ businesses and operations. Geographically, 86 employees were based in the United States and 19 employees were located internationally. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
