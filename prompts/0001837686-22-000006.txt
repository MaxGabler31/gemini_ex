Overview
Our mission
Our mission is to enable professional-quality video for all.
We believe that we can empower every professional, team and organization to use video, with tools that are far easier and more effective than ever before.
Who we are
We are the world’s leading all-in-one video software solution, providing the full breadth of video tools through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) model.
We provide a single turnkey solution to create, collaborate and communicate with video. Businesses face significant barriers to use video today, including time, cost, lack of technical expertise and the need to pay for and manage multiple software vendors. Our cloud-based software eliminates these barriers and solves essential video needs, including:
•Creation: Record, produce, edit and stream videos, for both live and on-demand viewing.
•Collaboration: Share videos privately with clients and teams, review and comment on work-in-progress videos and manage team access and permissions.
•Distribution: Share videos publicly, including: publishing on a website, blog, marketplace or social media platform, broadcasting through a secure corporate portal, or building a branded video destination or storefront.
•Hosting: Organize and manage a central video library across users and teams, in one centralized location.
•Marketing: Use video to engage customers.
•Monetization: Monetize video through a subscription fee, pay-per-view model or third-party advertising, across devices, currencies and payment methods.
•Analytics: Measure video performance across platforms, including tracking viewer engagement and drop-off rates, sources of traffic and customer leads.
We serve a growing community of over 260 million registered users (those users who have created an account with us using an email address) in over 190 countries. Our users include creative professionals, small businesses, marketers, agencies, schools, nonprofits and large organizations. They range from the Emmy-nominated animator working on her next short, to the beauty entrepreneur creating videos for Instagram and her Shopify store, to the Fortune 500 company live streaming town halls and remotely training sales associates at stores around the world.
We operate at a significant scale. As of December 31, 2021, our video player was embedded on millions of websites and is powering billions of views a month, with more than 300,000 new videos being uploaded to our platform each day. Our brand is well known and highly regarded, and most of our new users find us organically. We are also regarded as an industry leader in video technology, having set new standards in adopting higher resolutions, advanced imaging and audio protocols, new video compression formats and intelligent streaming algorithms. 
Businesses need video 
In the past decade, video has gone from a form of entertainment to the most engaging and effective medium to communicate ideas, build brands, promote products and connect with each other. This is because video is a far richer and more expressive medium than text or static images. As consumers spend more time online and as workforces become more distributed, businesses need to keep pace with their customers and employees, who increasingly expect to consume engaging video content. 
Yet for too many businesses, professional-quality video remains out of reach due to lack of time, budget and expertise. For example: 
•the average professionally-produced video takes weeks to make and costs thousands of dollars, but has a shelf life on social media of just a few days. Simply shooting content on one’s phone won’t produce a high-quality product demo, brand video or Facebook ad given the need to edit and stitch together multiple shots and add branding, music, voice-over and motion graphics. 
•collaborating on video projects is inefficient and full of friction, often requiring multiple pieces of software, shared passwords, expensive licenses and wasted time sharing feedback in back-and-forth email chains. 
•producing a live event typically requires expensive hardware and a professional production team. Even the largest companies struggle today to make their town halls, conferences, webinars and training programs high-quality and engaging. 
•companies lack a centralized, secure video library where all their videos are intuitively organized and easily searchable. They also lack robust and centralized video analytics to measure the return on their video investment across platforms and teams. 
Vimeo solves essential video needs 
We offer a SaaS solution that spans the full breadth of a business’s video needs. Our cloud-based software enables users to create, collaborate and communicate with video, eliminating the need to pay for multiple software providers and removing the barriers of time, budget and technical expertise for a wide range of use cases. For example: 
•a global company can integrate video across all of its corporate communications, from town halls and training to virtual conferences and product launches;
•any employee in an organization can live stream engaging events, whether to market a product, host a town hall with employees or educate customers;
•a flower shop owner can promote their store re-opening on social media with professional-looking videos they create on their phone in a few clicks; 
•a fitness studio can launch its own video channel to stream classes in TV-quality in a matter of minutes; and 
•a freelancer or creative agency can showcase their portfolio, collaborate with clients and deliver projects securely, all from a single account.
Trends in Our Favor 
We believe that we are witnessing the rapid proliferation of video into every aspect of business communication. We expect many more businesses to require video in the future, aided by the following secular trends: 
•Consumers expect engaging video. Consumers increasingly expect engaging and real-time video from both brands and employers. We expect the marked growth of self-produced video on social media platforms to put more pressure on businesses to produce professional-quality videos for these platforms as well. At work, employees are increasingly driving IT modernization as they demand the latest technologies from their personal lives in their workplace. 
•Video works better than image and text. Video is the most engaging medium. A 2018 analysis by Twitter showed that social media posts with video attract 10 times more engagement than those without, and a 2018 analysis by LinkedIn showed that videos are shared 20 times more often than other content formats. A 2020 study on advertising by Amazon shows that video increases clicks, conversion rates and visitor time-on-site, which can assist with both driving traffic and search engine optimization (SEO). 
•The nature of work is changing, and organizations must adapt. As workforces become more distributed and teams rely more on software to interact with their colleagues, video has become a critical tool to increase employee engagement, productivity and retention. A 2020 study completed by GlobalWebIndex for Vimeo shows that employees at companies that use video are 75% more likely to rate employee engagement highly and 72% more likely to rate productivity highly. Beyond distributed teams, the COVID-19 pandemic has likely ignited a permanent trend towards workplace flexibility. 
•Video is broadly distributed. In the past, online video was primarily viewed on desktop computers that required a physical high-speed Internet connection. Today, mobile phones and tablets enable high-definition video recording and playback, 5G network coverage is expanding, and connected TVs have made their way to many households. With consumers spending an average of over six hours a day watching online video content (based upon 2020 data from Nielsen), we expect more viewing surfaces to emerge in the future, from emerging platforms to virtual reality headsets to augmented reality devices to self-driving cars. As audiences engage on more devices, businesses will increasingly need a central hub to publish video across these platforms. 
Our Market Opportunity 
Target customers 
Our target customers include small-to-midsize businesses (SMBs), larger enterprises, marketers, agencies and creative professionals. 
We believe that anyone who produces video content, markets to customers, works with distributed teams or hosts in-person experiences is a potential Vimeo user. We further believe that once our users begin to experience the benefits of our 
platform, they tend to greatly expand their use of video internally and externally. As a result, we expect that use of our platform will increase the broader market penetration of video across all customer types and use cases. 
Geographic market 
Our market is global. Our products are used by customers in over 190 countries. 
Total addressable market 
Based on our internal data, in 2021 we estimated our total addressable market to be approximately $40 billion, growing to $70 billion in 2024. While our opportunity includes a range of customer types, we believe the largest market segments are: 
•Small-to-midsize businesses (SMBs) who use video for marketing to consumers. IDC estimates the number of global SMBs to be 348 million. We estimate that there is an approximately $20 billion market of SMBs willing to pay for video software, aided by the growing need for brands of all sizes to reach their customers on social media and increase engagement on their websites and marketplaces. We expect this market to grow to approximately $25 billion in 2024. 
•Enterprises who use video for internal and external communications. CapIQ estimates that there are more than one million global enterprises with annual revenues above $10 million. We believe every one of these organizations will look to use video, and that as our product portfolio expands to cover more use cases, departments and employees within the enterprise, we can materially expand both our footprint and contract value. We estimate the addressable market for enterprises to be currently at approximately $20 billion and expect it to grow to approximately $45 billion in 2024. 
Our Business Model and Services 
We earn revenue primarily through a SaaS business model, selling subscriptions to our cloud-based software on an annual or monthly basis. We employ a “freemium” pricing strategy, offering free membership and access to our video tools alongside paid subscription plans for advanced video capabilities. As of December 31, 2021, over 95% of our subscribers purchased plans without ever speaking to customer support or going through a salesperson. 
Basic (free) memberships 
Anyone can access a basic (free) membership to Vimeo by signing up with an email address. With a basic membership, users can create, record, upload and share videos through our website and native apps for free. Our free users are subject to weekly and total caps on uploaded videos, and do not have access to advanced video capabilities such as live streaming or the ability to add team members. We provide opportunities to upgrade to a paid subscription at natural points in the user’s experience, such as when a free user nears or hits an uploaded video cap. We also highlight the advanced video capabilities of our subscription plans natively within our free user product experience. 
Self-serve subscription plans
We offer paid subscription plans on a “self-serve” basis, meaning that users can sign up directly through our website or apps and pay subscription fees with a credit card or an in-app purchase mechanism. We charge fees that typically range from $7 per month to $900 per year for features that vary depending on the plan type. These features include video creation, collaboration, distribution, hosting, marketing, monetization and analytics. We also offer the ability to add multiple team members to our higher-priced plans. As of December 31, 2021, nearly 15% of our subscribers had added team members. 
Sales-assisted subscription plans 
We sell subscription plans through our sales force. These "sales-assisted" plans provide additional features beyond our self-serve plans, plus options for dedicated support, account management, service level agreements and professional live event services. Our sales-assisted contracts range from thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, nearly 80% of our new sales-assisted contracts came from customers who were existing free users or self-serve subscribers first. As of December 31, 2021, sales-assisted customers represented 30% of our revenue. Our sales-assisted plans include: 
•Vimeo Enterprise: Vimeo’s video offering for large organizations that includes intuitive tools to record and upload content, secure live streaming of events, a corporate video library, webinar functionality, single-sign-on support, content delivery network optimization to improve quality-of-service in corporate networks, robust analytics, and the ability to use our technology on a white-label basis (so that a company’s own branding is featured instead of Vimeo’s).
•Vimeo OTT: an over-the-top (OTT) video monetization solution that allows customers to launch and run their own video streaming channel directly to their audience through a branded web portal, mobile apps and Internet-enabled TV apps. Our customers have a direct relationship with the end viewers of their content, and we handle everything from app development to billing to customer support. Customers may offer their videos on a subscription basis, an à la carte basis, an ad-supported basis or for free. 
•Vimeo Custom: plans optimized for high-volume users, e.g., plans that offer significantly higher storage or bandwidth.
Sales and Marketing 
We acquire subscribers primarily through: (1) conversion of free users to subscribers through organic efforts, including word-of-mouth referrals and in-product messaging; (2) acquisition of subscribers through marketing spend, primarily through digital media channels; (3) our sales force (for sales-assisted customers); and (4) acquisition of subscribers through third party partnerships and integrations. 
Key Benefits to Customers 
We believe that our solutions provide the following benefits to our customers: 
•Centralized video solution. We provide an integrated video software solution that enables video creation, hosting, distribution and measurement in one interface. Our platform eliminates the need to purchase and manage multiple software providers for editing, storage, publishing and analytics. 
•Scalable, reliable video delivery. Our video player delivers a best-in-class playback and live streaming experience for audiences of all sizes, and we optimize video delivery across devices, geographies, bandwidth and network performance. Our technology enables streaming of high dynamic range (HDR) video in up to 8K resolution, and is built to scale with organizations as their needs advance. 
•Easy to use. We provide a self-serve and intuitive interface that can be easily navigated by even first-time users. The vast majority of our users never speak to a customer support agent or salesperson. Our platform removes the need for video-specific expertise and high-touch user support and troubleshooting. 
•Fast setup, no hardware required. Our cloud-based software runs natively on desktop and mobile devices without requiring any specialized hardware or need to download third-party software. 
•Attractive return on investment. We provide the advanced capabilities of a live TV studio (on-screen graphics, video switching, audio mixing, audience Q&A and polls) and sophisticated marketing tools (branding customization, in-video calls-to-action, email capture and cross-platform distribution) at an accessible price point. For large organizations, switching to our platform reduces the time and cost associated with expensive on-premises infrastructure and continual maintenance. 
•Fully branded, customizable experience. We enable subscribers to fully customize the video player experience and exercise complete control over their content and who sees it. We also enable subscribers to build branded video channels, destinations and storefronts off Vimeo, so they can directly own the relationship with their viewers.
•Interoperable and integrated. Vimeo integrates with cloud-based software applications such as Shopify, GoDaddy, Dropbox, Google, Slack, Adobe, Mailchimp, HubSpot, Asana and Figma. We also have an ecosystem of distribution partners where we enable native publishing of videos, including Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest and TikTok. 
•Developer-friendly. We enable anyone to build on top of our platform. Our flexible video APIs (application programming interfaces) allow external developers and engineering teams to build their own applications using our technology. 
•Robust customer support. We offer 24/7/365 support globally, through live chat, email, telephone and video. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our customer support team achieved a customer satisfaction score (CSAT) of over 90%. We are committed to providing our users with best-in-class support, as we believe this is a critical driver of our ability to build long-term relationships with them.
Our Growth Strategy
We focus on the following areas to drive our growth: 
•Grow our free user base: Our adoption is driven by a virtuous cycle of users collaborating on and sharing videos. Every time a free user uploads a video that someone else watches, that viewer experiences a part of our platform. As a result, our addressable customer base expands each time our users publish or broadcast videos to their audience, privately share Vimeo links, collaborate with their team on a video project or embed Vimeo’s video player on another platform. These actions attract viewers, who may then decide to register and become users. Our player is embedded on millions of websites and has powered over a hundred billion views. 
•Convert free users into subscribers: We provide a high-quality free product with numerous features that have the potential to be used repeatedly, and we offer price- and feature-optimized tiering of our subscription plans to drive organic conversion of free users to subscribers over time. 
•Extend customer value: We seek to employ a “land and expand” strategy where we inspire our existing subscribers to increase video adoption and usage and upgrade to higher-priced plans over time. For sales-assisted customers, we seek to expand the number of employees, teams and departments using our platform and increase contract value organization-wide. 
•Product innovation: We continuously innovate and improve our platform by investing in research and development, customer insights and business intelligence analytics. We strive to make both our free and paid experiences more compelling so that our users find increasing value in our services. 
•Partnerships: We seek to grow our presence on third-party platforms with native product integrations, and encourage third-party platforms to natively integrate their software and tools with us. 
•International: We seek to attract more subscribers outside of the U.S. through localized product, marketing and sales efforts in other countries. 
•Sales and marketing: We intend to increase investments in marketing and in our sales team to reach and convert more customers. We monitor our sales and marketing spend and return on investment closely to ensure that we are acquiring customers in an efficient manner. 
Competition and Competitive Advantages 
Competition 
Due to the breadth of our all-in-one video solution, we face competition from a range of companies that provide cloud-based video software tools:
•We compete with large social media platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube, which allow users to upload and share videos for free. While these platforms provide far fewer video capabilities, they offer a large built-in audience, social media-specific features, and the ability to monetize video plays through advertising. We currently partner with the majority of these platforms and view our role as the agnostic distribution platform to help businesses create and publish content across social media. 
•We compete with traditional online video distributors that provide video hosting, content management, distribution, analytics, and in-stream advertisements to larger customers. Operators of these services tend to focus on large media organizations and often also provide custom solutions. We further compete with targeted video point solutions that offer a subset of video capabilities such as screen recording or event-based live streaming. 
•As we expand more into enterprise capabilities, we expect to compete more with two-way video communications software such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. These services allow multiple users to communicate with each other in real time via video and are increasingly adding features that overlap with our platform, including support for webinars and centralized video management. We currently offer integrations and partnerships with many of these companies. 
•Finally, we face competition from services that were not traditionally video-centric, such as Slack (real-time text-based communications), Dropbox (cloud storage), and Canva (graphic design). These services have increasingly added support for video features including screen recording, video hosting and playback, and video creation. We currently offer integrations and partnerships with many of these companies as well.
Competitive advantages 
We believe that our competitive advantages include: 
•Centralized video solution. Vimeo is unique in that we provide an integrated video software solution that eliminates the need to connect and pay for multiple software providers for video creation, hosting, distribution and analytics. The breadth of our tools enables us to offer more value at a competitive price point, and serve a broader range of customer types and use cases.
•Agnostic distribution: Social media platforms are overwhelmingly focused on increasing advertising dollars through viewership on their own properties. However, most businesses need and want to distribute their videos across multiple (if not all) platforms to reach the highest number of potential customers. We are an agnostic provider who can facilitate distribution across these platforms as well as on websites, apps and marketplaces. Our business model is aligned with our users’ need to put their videos everywhere, and as a result we can provide more distribution opportunities than social media platforms can or are likely to provide. We therefore view social media platforms as our partners rather than competitors, and we already enable native distribution from Vimeo to Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter and Pinterest.
•Ad-free, fully branded experience. Unlike social media platforms, we offer our free users an ad-free video player, and enable subscribers to fully customize the video player experience and exercise complete control over their content. Because we don’t monetize audiences through advertising, we never try to drive traffic away from our users’ content or website. We further enable subscribers to build branded video channels, destinations and storefronts off Vimeo, so they can directly own the relationship with their viewers.
•High-quality product. Our video player delivers a best-in-class playback and live streaming experience for audiences of all sizes, optimized across devices, geographies, bandwidth and network performance. Our technology enables streaming of high dynamic range (HDR) video in up to 8K resolution, and is built to scale with organizations as their needs advance. 
•Economies of scale. As we store and deliver more video, we are able to reduce our variable costs. The significant scale at which we operate has enabled us to improve our margins without increasing our prices. For example, our gross margin reached 75% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. This further allows us to offer accessible pricing in areas that have been historically cost-prohibitive, such as professional-quality live streaming, over-the-top (OTT) delivery and 8K/HDR video streaming.
•Cross-platform data. As a result of our scale, we have deep insight into video engagement and performance across platforms. We expect to use this data over time to provide personalized insights, dynamically optimize content, improve video quality and recommend which types of videos to make, when and for which platform. Our ability to deliver smarter products and insights for our users increases with the more data we collect, and the amount of data we collect increases as our users grow.
•Creative community. Many creatives whose work we have recognized as Staff Picks have said that Vimeo’s recognition helped them launch their video careers, and the majority of them showcased their work primarily on Vimeo. We believe that the diversity, size and engagement of our creative community is an asset that is difficult for others to replicate. 
Technology 
We use proprietary video creation, storage, delivery and playback technology that we have developed or acquired over the past 17 years. We are at the forefront of adopting next-generation video codecs like HEVC and AV1, which use advanced data compression and state-of-the-art prediction techniques to increase video playback quality. 
We invest heavily in research and development to drive product improvements and innovation. As of December 31, 2021, over 40% of our employees were in product and engineering roles. The majority of our development work is done in-house, complemented by open-source software, off-the-shelf commercial software, and proprietary vendor-developed software. 
Acquisitions 
In 2016, we acquired VHX, a provider of over-the-top OTT streaming and monetization services. In 2017, we acquired Livestream, a provider of professional live streaming services. In 2019, we acquired Magisto, a provider of AI-driven video creation and editing tools. Today each of these capabilities is available through the Vimeo platform. In 2021, we acquired WIREWAX, a provider of interactive and shoppable video tools, and Wibbitz, a provider of video creation tools.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property includes registered trademarks, such as VIMEO, in the U.S. and over 15 other countries; 18 U.S. patents that claim various technologies that we may use in our operations, including patents directed to live video streaming and video editing using artificial intelligence technologies, with expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2039; copyrights in our source code, website, apps and creative assets; over 220 domain names, including Vimeo.com and Livestream.com; and trade secrets.
Human Capital 
As a software technology company, our employees are our number one resource. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,219 full-time employees, of whom 474 were based outside of the U.S. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Overall, we consider our relations with employees to be good. 
Our Company Culture 
We believe that our company culture is a critical driver of our business success. We are a mission-driven company and have designed a set of guiding principles, along with our programs and processes, to help us maximize the potential of every individual in our company. Our principles are: 
•Start with Users. 
•Ask Why. 
•Aim High. 
•Own It. 
•Be Real. 
We believe this approach fosters a culture that is transparent, innovative and ambitious, all of which enable us to drive long-term customer value and achieve competitive differentiation.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We believe our impact is greatest when our workforce represents the diverse and global community that we serve. Accordingly, we view diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) efforts as integral to our success. We have a robust DE&I program that is headed by a dedicated head of DE&I, who reports to our Chief People Officer. Our DE&I efforts include: 
•Hiring practices: We use a number of techniques, primarily directed toward expanding our pipeline, to achieve a diverse workforce. Beginning in 2020, we started implementing, across selected departments in the U.S., a goal of ensuring that women, BIPOC (black, indigenous and people of color), LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, genderqueer, queer, intersexed, agender and asexual) and candidates with disabilities comprise a minimum of 30% of candidates who reach the hiring manager interview stage of our hiring process. 
•Employee community (resource) groups (ECGs): ECGs at Vimeo are employee-led and organizationally-supported groups of employees that are drawn together by shared characteristics (such as ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) or shared interests. Participation is open to all. Each ECG has a leader and an executive sponsor from our leadership team. ECGs serve as a resource, point of connection, and community for underrepresented employees and their allies, and are an important part of building and maintaining an equitable, diverse and inclusive workforce and community. ECGs also play an integral role in helping Vimeo reach its strategic DE&I goals as they relate to our business operations, our workplace and our community. 
•Cultural education, bias mitigation, and allyship: We provide regular programming on cultural awareness, bias mitigation, and allyship by partnering with third parties. All new hires are required to participate in unconscious bias training. 
•Skill development: We provide mentoring opportunities for employees as well as learning and development resources, including an annual stipend for educational activities relevant to one’s job. In addition, we provide regular manager training and coaching opportunities to continue to build skills. 
As of December 31, 2021, our U.S. workforce was, based upon employee self-identification, 59% white, 15% Asian, 4% of two or more racial groups, 6% black, 7% of Hispanic or Latin background, and 0.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; 9% declined to self-identify. As of the same date, our workforce was 60% male, 39% female, and 1% non-binary. We publicly publish metrics on these and other measures of diversity at least once annually. 
Compensation 
We believe in a performance-based culture and have structured our compensation packages to reflect that. Employees are paid either a salary or on an hourly basis depending on their job duties and legal requirements. For non-sales salaried employees, we set targets for discretionary bonuses as a percentage of base salary, and we determine year-end bonuses based upon a combination of company performance, team performance, and individual performance. Sales-based employees are entitled to commissions based upon sales. 
We maintain an employee equity program in which we grant equity to all full-time employees and permanent part-time employees who regularly work at least 70% of a workweek. We presently grant restricted stock units (RSUs) through a program that we call the “YourChoice RSU” program, which gives employees the ability to choose between alternative RSU awards of different sizes and vesting periods and provides for refresh grants at regular intervals. We expect to continue providing employees with equity. 
In addition to these compensation methods, we provide a broad range of benefits, including comprehensive health and retirement benefits, that we believe meet or exceed market levels. For example, for U.S. full-time employees, we match all pre-tax contributions by our employees to our 401(k) plan, as well as post-tax contributions by our employees to Roth individual retirement accounts, dollar for dollar in an amount of up to 10% of an employee’s base salary (subject to an annual cap). 
We are committed to providing competitive and equitable pay. We base our compensation on market data and conduct evaluations of our salary bands and compensation practices with a third-party consultant on a regular basis to determine the competitiveness and fairness of our packages. 
Talent development 
We are committed to empowering our people with career advancement and learning opportunities. We do this by providing, among other things: guidance on expectations for job levels; bi-annual employee evaluations; mentoring programs; training for new managers; professional and leadership development training for ECG leaders; one-on-one coaching for leadership roles; and a stipend for annual learning and development opportunities. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to domestic and foreign laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet generally, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. 
Because we host user-uploaded content, we may be subject to laws concerning such content. In the U.S., we rely, to a significant degree, on laws that limit the liability of online providers for user-uploaded content, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA) and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Countries outside the U.S. generally do not provide as robust protections for online providers and may instead regulate such entities to a higher degree. For example, in certain countries, online providers may be liable for hosting certain types of content or may be required to remove such content within a short period of time upon notice. We or our customers may also be subject to laws that regulate 
streaming services or online platforms, such as the EU’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive or EU Regulation 2019/1150, which regulates platform-to-business relations. 
Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy and data security in the U.S. and worldwide. Examples of such regimes include Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Law (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). These laws generally regulate the collection, storage, transfer and use of personal information. 
Due to our subscription business model, we are subject to a variety of laws governing online transactions, payment card transactions and the automatic renewal of online agreements. In the U.S., these matters are regulated by, among other things, the federal Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act (ROSCA) and various state laws. 
As a U.S.-based company with foreign offices, we are subject to a variety of foreign laws governing our foreign operations, as well as U.S. laws that restrict trade and certain practices, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
