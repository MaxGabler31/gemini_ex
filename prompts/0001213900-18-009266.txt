New Strategy and Current business
 
Since 2012, the Company has focused on marketing, developing and acquiring technologies designed to improve the environment by reducing pollution. The Company has acquired technologies, patents and intellectual property from EnviroTechnologies Inc. through share transfer, assignment and representation agreements entered into during 2012 and 2013. Following those acquisitions, management has expanded the registration of intellectual property rights around the world and pursued opportunities globally for the development and marketing of the emission control technologies.
 
Working with a worldwide network of agents to market the ENVI-Systems™ emission control technologies, the Company has focused on three applications of the technology:
 
ENVI-Marine TM
 
Diesel exhaust from ships, ferries and tankers includes ash and soot as particulate components and sulphur dioxide as an acid gas. Testing has been conducted on diesel shipping to confirm the application of seawater as a neutralizing agent for sulphur emissions as well as capturing particulate matter. In addition to marine applications, these tests also showed applicability of the system for large displacement engines such as stationary generators, compressors, container handling, heavy construction and mining equipment.
 
The Company manufactured the components for an ENVI-Marine unit to be installed in Union Maritimes’ (Union) MV Westminster chemical ship during the summer of 2017. Under the terms of an Energy Management Lease dated December 16, 2016, Union will make quarterly payments to the Company determined on their savings realized by the ENVI-Marine units’ operation up to an aggregate of $1,995,000.
 
The Company has been actively marketing its ENVI-Marine™ units to ship brokers and ship owners through most of the year.
 
ENVI-Pure TM
 
Increasing legislation relating to landfill of municipal solid waste has led to the emergence of increasing numbers of waste to energy plants (“WtE”). A WtE plant obviates the need for landfill, burning municipal waste for conversion to electricity. A WtE plant is typically 45-100MW. The ENVI-Clean™ system is particularly suited to WtE as it cleans multiple pollutants in a single system.
 
ENVI-Clean TM
 
EnviroTechnologies Inc. has successfully conducted sulphur dioxide demonstration tests at the American Bituminous Coal Partners power plant in Grant Town, West Virginia. The testing achieved a three test average of 99.3% removal efficiency. The implementation of US Clean Air regulations in July 2010 has created additional demand for sulphur dioxide removal in all industries emitting sulphur pollution. Furthermore, China consumes approximately one half of the world’s coal, but introduced measures designed to reduce energy and carbon intensity in its 12th Five Year Plan. Applications include regional power facilities and heating for commercial buildings and greenhouses. Typical applications range in size from 1 to 20 megawatts (MW) with power generation occupying the larger end of the range.
 
Following the signing of a joint venture agreement with Power China SPEM, subsequent to year end an ENVI-Clean™ was sold to a steelworks company in Yancheng to remove SO2 from its 93MW gas combustion powerplant.
 
The ENVI-Clean™ system removes most of the sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels.
 
The ENVI-Clean™ system is comprised of five components:
 

● | an induced draft fan (“ID fan”); 
--+-------------------------------------
● | a gas conditioning chamber; 
● | the ENVI-Clean™ unit; 
● | a demister; and 
● | settling tanks. 



2

 

The ID fan creates the pressure differential required to force the gas through the scrubbing fluid suspended on each head and move it through the other components in the system. The gas conditioning chamber cools the hot flue gas prior to entering the ENVI-Clean™ System. The ENVI-Clean™ System contains the heads and the demister pads at the exhaust exit. The neutralizing fluid is constantly circulated and cleaned by mechanical means with the contaminated component of the separation going to a settling tank prior to dewatering. The settled solids are disposed of with the bottom ash produced by the combustion process.
 


The ENVI-CES™ technology forces 100% of the polluted exhaust flue gas into the neutralizing fluid to produce a highly turbulent interaction between the target pollutants and the fluid. The aggressive mixing produces small bubbles which create a very high surface contact area between the exhaust gas and fluid to enhance the transfer of particulate and targeted gaseous and hazardous pollutants from the exhaust to the fluid.
 


Schematic of the ENVI-Clean™ Emission’s System as installed for Biomass applications
 
Unique to the ENVI approach is the introduction of the gas in the lower section of the ENVI-Clean™ unit which makes the greatest portion of its cross section available for fluid–gas interaction. This permits a smaller and highly flexible footprint. Furthermore, the system design allows for multiple heads each containing different neutralizing fluids to remove various pollutants from the flue gas. The ordered removal of acid and greenhouse gases within a single unit makes the system highly desirable by industries whose fuels contain multiple contaminants. The resulting ENVI-Clean™ unit has high efficiency and is very simple to operate.
 
The neutralizing solution is selected to remove targeted pollutants: limestone and hydrated lime are used to neutralize the scrubbing solution for the removal of acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride. The unique design of the ENVI system allows for the sequential removal of pollutants by stacking heads and utilizing different neutralizing chemistry in each operating unit. This provides industry with a system that fulfills multiple applications.
 
The ENVI-Clean™ system has numerous new and retrofit applications:
 

● | coal and coal waste fuelled CFBC boilers; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
● | pulverized coal and stoker-grate boilers; 
● | heavy oil fired boilers; 
● | biomass and waste to energy boilers; 
● | lime kilns, dryers, shredders and foundries; 
● | industrial exhaust scrubbing of particulates and acid gases; 
● | diesel engines, large marine and stationary engines; and 
● | sewage sludge, hazardous waste and MSW incinerators.

Significant transactions
 
Management, assisted by PGG, identified an opportunity to build a business focused on marketing, developing and acquiring technologies designed to improve the environment by reducing pollution. To this end, we entered into and closed an assignment and share transfer agreement, on June 14, 2012, for the assignment of a representation agreement and the acquisition of a company involved in the environmental technology industry.
 
The assignment and share transfer agreement provided for the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Pacific Green Technologies Limited, formerly PGG’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Additionally, PGG has assigned to our company a ten year exclusive worldwide representation agreement with EnviroTechnologies Inc., (formerly EnviroResolutions, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, to market and sell EnviroTechnologies’ current and future environmental technologies. The representation agreement entitles PGG to a commission of 20% of all sales (net of taxes) generated by EnviroTechnologies. Pursuant to the terms of the assignment and share transfer agreement, all rights and obligations under the representation agreement have been transferred to our company. We currently anticipate that sales under the representation agreement will be our sole source of revenue for the foreseeable future. We had intended to complete an acquisition of EnviroTechnologies, as this would have been a logical step in our development. However, as discussed herein, we have settled with EnviroTechnologies as an alternative.
 
Both Sichel and PGG are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Hookipa Trust. PGG’s wholly owned subsidiary was Pacific Green Technologies Limited. As a result, we acquired Pacific Green Technologies Limited from PGG. Sichel is a significant shareholder of our company and also provides us with consulting services. The sole director of Sichel is also the sole director of PGG. Further, PGG is a significant shareholder of EnviroTechnologies.
 
The assignment and share transfer agreement closed on June 14, 2012 via the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock as well as a $5,000,000 promissory note to PGG. We have consequently undertaken the operations of Pacific Green Technologies Limited and PGG’s obligations under the representation agreement.
 
Full consideration contemplated by the assignment and share transfer agreement was $25,000,000 satisfied through the issue of 5,000,000 new shares of our common stock at a price of $4 per share with the balance of $5,000,000 structured as a promissory note over the next five years as follows:
 

● | June 12, 2013, $1,000,000; 
--+-----------------------------------
● | June 12, 2014, $1,000,000; 
● | June 12, 2015, $1,000,000; 
● | June 12, 2016, $1,000,000 and; 
● | June 12, 2017, $1,000,000. 

 
Under the terms of the promissory note, the loan repayments specified above shall not exceed the amount we earn under the terms of the representation agreement. If we are unable to meet the repayment schedule set out above, PGG will have the option to either roll over any unpaid portion to the following payment date or to convert the outstanding amount into new shares of our common stock. However, the entire amount of the promissory note is due upon the maturity date on the fifth anniversary. On September 25, 2017, the Company and PGG agreed to a settlement of the outstanding promissory by way of a subscription agreement for 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share.
 
The initial total consideration of $25,000,000 was a purchase price not determined under U.S. GAAP, and both the $25,000,000 total price and the deemed price of $4 per share does not represent the fair value of the stock issued or a value used in accounting for the acquisition. The number of shares issued and the terms of the promissory note were negotiated between the parties and are intended to represent full consideration for the acquisition of Pacific Green Technologies Limited and the representation agreement.
 
Our management believes that the ENVI-Clean™ system has significant competitive advantages in the market for emission control systems including:
 

1. | Efficiency: tests performed at an 84MW coal power plant in West Virginia (USA) indicate that the ENVI-Clean™ system removed on average 99.3% of sulfur dioxide over a three day period from the plant’s emissions; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Low Capital Cost: the system has a compact and flexible footprint relative to competitive products. For electricity generation applications, EnviroTechnologies’ system is priced for market at approximately $90 per kilowatt of electricity generation. In comparison, industry consultants state that comparable systems in North America are typically priced at $300-500 per kilowatt (Source: High Energy Services/Babcock & Wilson-wet scrubber systems for S02 removal in North America); 
3. | Low Ongoing Operating Cost: the ENVI-Clean™ system is more affordable in the long term for customers compared to competitor products; 
4. | New and Retrofit Applications: for retrofit applications in particular (as required by the 2011 EPA Boiler MACT Requirements), the system is considered by management to be more compact and adaptable than rival systems; 
5. | Scalability: the ENVI-Clean™ system can be adapted for the largest power stations but also smaller applications such as diesel marine engines. It can also remove multiple pollutants in a single system, unlike much of the competition.

On October 5, 2011, EnviroResolutions, a British Columbia corporation, signed a contract to supply the ENVI-Clean™ system to a new waste to energy plant being built in Peterborough, United Kingdom (the “Peterborough Contract”). The initial material term and condition of the contract was that EnviroResolutions demonstrate testing of the system that achieved the performance levels represented in regards to emissions by March 31, 2012. This condition was successfully satisfied and confirmed with Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited (“PREL”) prior to the required date. The Peterborough Contract entitles us, as the holder of the representation agreement, to a commission of approximately $4,600,000 before third party agency fees.
 
Effective March 5, 2013, we entered into a supplemental agreement with EnviroTechnologies and EnviroResolutions. The supplemental agreement amends the representation agreement between PGG and EnviroTechnologies dated June 7, 2010, which was later assigned to us from PGG in connection with an assignment and share transfer agreement dated June 14, 2012. The supplemental agreement entitles our company to a commission of equal to 50% (previously 20%) of any licensing revenue that may be generated by EnviroTechnologies Inc. in respect of its existing and future technologies.
 
In addition, pursuant to the supplemental agreement, we will receive from EnviroResolutions an amount equal to 50% of any assets or consideration received as compensation from PREL for PREL’s failure to perform under a contingent sale agreement dated October 5, 2011 between EnviroResolutions and PREL. We will receive the fee for our assistance to EnviroResolutions during their negotiations with PREL regarding PREL’s failure to perform. The fee, if any, provided to us will not constitute any repayment of our loans that were made to EnviroResolutions.
 
The supplemental agreement supplements the Peterborough Contract dated October 5, 2011 entered into among EnviroResolutions, PREL and GEPL. Pursuant to the Peterborough Contract, EnviroResolutions was to supply PREL with a wet scrubbing emission control system to a proposed waste to energy plant being built in Peterborough, United Kingdom.
 
Information on Pacific Green Technologies Limited
 
Pacific Green Technologies Limited is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on April 5, 2011 (“PGT”). The director of PGT was Mr. Joseph Grigor Kelly. On November 7, 2012, Mr. Joseph Grigor Kelly tendered his resignation to the board of directors. PGT has no employees. Concurrently, Neil Carmichael consented to and was appointed as the sole director and chief executive and financial officer of PGT.
 
The purpose of incorporating PGT was to utilize local knowledge and contacts to build a platform for sales in the following regions: Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russian Federation, Turkey, Middle East, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Africa. However, our company has found that the cost to have physical presence in England far out weights the benefit. As a result, PGT is now in the process of being dissolved as of the date of the filing of this annual report.
 
Information on Pacific Green Energy Parks Limited
 
Pacific Green Energy Parks Limited (“PGEP”) sees an opportunity to develop renewable power stations with capacities up to 50MW in the biomass and waste to energy sectors. In addition to their positive impact on the world’s environment, these projects have the potential to deliver a sustainable post-tax equity IRR and may provide our company with an opportunity to deploy its technologies. To this end our company has been identifying and investigating appropriate projects worldwide.
 
On March 26, 2012, PGEP reached an agreement with the shareholders of Energy Park Sutton Bridge Limited (“EPSB”), whereby PGEP would fund a planning application for the development of a biomass energy plant in return for a 75% shareholding in EPSB. EPSB was incorporated in the UK in 2009 to develop a 49 MW biomass energy plant in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, UK. A planning application for EPSB was submitted to South Holland District Council (“SHDC”) on September 4, 2012.

On March 5, 2013, PGEP acquired the remaining 25% of EPSB. On May 8, 2013, EPSB secured planning permission for a 49MW biomass power plant at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire.
 
The facility will have an installed energy capacity of 49MW. The export capacity of the facility will be circa 44MW. The electricity will be supplied to the National Grid. Heat from the operation will be used within the facility and the ancillary buildings whilst off-take points will be provided for future combined heat and power needs in the area. The location of the plant alongside an existing industrial estate and in proximity of an area proposed for future industrial expansion makes the realization of the potential for combined heat and power more likely than in other possible locations. EPSB has secured options to purchase the freehold of the Energy Park site from the land owners.
 
Biomass is considered to be carbon neutral because the quantity of CO2 released during combustion is the same as that absorbed by plants as a result of photosynthesis during their growth. This differs from fossil fuels in that, although both originating from organic matter, the carbon in fossil fuels has been locked away for millions of years, and when released during combustion, results in a net increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
 
Biomass is also considered environmentally sustainable as in many cases it is derived from by-products of other industries such as agriculture and forestry management. This contains a closed carbon cycle with no net increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. As a result, EPSB will be entitled to renewables obligation certificates (“ROCs”) under the UK’s Renewable Obligation regime. As of April 2016, pure biomass will be afforded 1.4 ROCs/MWh of electricity produced, for a 20 year tariff period. EPSB’s forecasts assume:
 
EPSB will recover energy from virgin wood using steam turbine technology. The plant will require approximately 325,000 tonnes of virgin wood per annum (“Feedstock”).
 
Following discussions with industry experts, engineers, consultants and financiers, our company estimates that EPSB should cost approximately £165,000,000 to construct. Once the project is “spade ready”, construction should take 2 years. Previously, we anticipated that the project would be “spade ready” by March 2014. However, our company’s application for planning consent was not accepted by council and we resubmitted our application on June 20, 2014. The EPC contractor will provide a fixed cost turnkey completion guarantee. Planning consent was again turned down April 2015.
 
A detailed carbon assessment has been submitted within the EIA presenting the carbon savings offered by the operation of the facility.
 
The project will deliver combined heat and power (“CHP”) infrastructure. Our company is investigating potential opportunities for supplying local heat customers at both existing and potential new developments off site. EPSB will maintain an open dialogue with the local authority and will ensure that an appropriate boiler and turbine design is selected to facilitate the distribution of heat.
 
Currently our company is identifying and assessing further renewable power plant developments that are complimentary to the use of ENVI-Emissions Systems where possible.
 
Securing additional financial and human capital
 
We have limited capital and four directors. It is anticipated that we will expand our management team to fully exploit the representation agreement and it will also therefore be necessary to raise financial capital. We will therefore proactively seek the raising of additional financial capital.
 
Form of any subsequent acquisitions
 
The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, our respective needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity, and our relative negotiating strength compared to that of such promoters.
 
It is likely that we will acquire further participations in business opportunities through the issuance of our common stock, or other of our securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization.


6

 

Our stockholders will likely not have control of a majority of our voting securities following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by our stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to us of the related costs incurred.
 
Other Business Matters
 
On April 3, 2013, we entered into and closed a share exchange agreement with certain shareholders of EnviroTechnologies. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire 17,653,872 issued and outstanding common shares of EnviroTechnologies from the shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 1,765,395 shares of the common stock of our company. We issued an aggregate of 1,765,395 common shares to 47 shareholders.
 
On April 25, 2013, we entered into and closed share exchange agreements with certain shareholders of EnviroTechnologies. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire 6,682,357 issued and outstanding common shares of EnviroTechnologies from the shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 668,238 shares of common stock of our company. We issued an aggregate of 668,238 common shares to 20 shareholders.
 
On May 15, 2013, we entered into and closed a stock purchase agreement with all five of the shareholders of Pacific Green Energy Parks Limited (“PGEP”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. PGEP is the sole shareholder of Energy Park Sutton Bridge Limited, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. PGEP is developing a biomass power plant facility and holds an option to purchase the real property upon which the facility will be built.
 
Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, we agreed to acquire all of the 1,752 issued and outstanding common shares of PGEP from the shareholders in exchange for:
 

1. | a payment of $100 upon execution of the stock purchase agreement, which has been paid by us; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | $14,000,000 paid in common shares in our capital stock at a deemed price at the lower of $4 per share or the average closing price per share of our capital stock in the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of closing of the stock purchase agreement, which have been issued by us; 
3. | $3,000,000 payable in common shares of our capital stock at a deemed price at the lower of $4 per share or the average closing price per share of our capital stock in the ten trading days immediately preceding the date upon which PGEP either purchases the property or secures a lease permitting PGEP to operate the facility on the property, which has not yet occurred; and

All consideration from our company to the shareholders has been and will be issued on a pro-rata, pari-passu basis in proportion to the respective number of shares of PGEP sold by each respective shareholder. On May 15, 2013, pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 3,500,000 common shares, at an agreed upon deemed price of $4 per share, to the five shareholders.
 
Pacific Green Energy Parks Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, Energy Park Sutton Bridge, are now subsidiaries of our company.
 
On May 17, 2013, we entered into a debt settlement agreement with EnviroTechnologies and EnviroResolutions (collectively, the “Debtors”). Pursuant to the terms of the debt settlement agreement, we agreed to release and waive all obligations of the Debtors to repay debts, in the aggregate of $293,406 and CAD$38,079, to us and agreed to return an aggregate of 88,876,443 (as of March 31, 2015, 2,217,130 common shares of EnviroTechnologies remain to be returned) common shares of EnviroTechnologies to EnviroResolutions. As consideration for this release and waiver and return of shares, the Debtors agreed to transfer all rights, interests and title to certain intellectual property, the physical embodiments of such intellectual property, and to the supplemental agreement dated March 5, 2013 among EnviroResolutions, PREL and Green Energy Parks Limited (“GEPL”) (collectively, the “Debtors’ Assets”).
 
The Debtors’ Assets include the intellectual property rights throughout most of the world for the ENVI-Clean™ system, the ENVI-Pure™ system and the ENVI-SEA™ scrubber. The ENVI-Clean™ system removes most of the sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels. The ENVI-Pure™ emission system combines the ENVI-Clean™ highly effective patent-pending wet scrubbing technology with an innovative wet electrostatic precipitator and a granular activated carbon adsorber to remove particulate matter, acid gases, regulated metals, dioxins and VOCs from the flue gas to levels significantly below those required by strictest international regulations. The ENVI-SEA™ scrubber can be applied to diesel exhaust emissions that require sulphur and particulate matter abatement. Using seawater on a single-pass basis as the scrubbing fluid in combination with its patent pending scrubbing head will provide a highly interactive zone of turbulent mixing for absorption of SO2, particulate matter and other pollutants from the engine’s exhaust.
 
The following is a brief description of further terms and conditions of the debt settlement agreement that are material to our company:
 

1. | we pay 25% of all funds, if any, received under the supplemental agreement to the Debtors within 14 days upon receipt of funds, if any, pursuant to the supplemental agreement; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | we enter into definitive agreements with the Debtors to: 
a. | license the Debtors’ Assets back to the Debtors, under arm’s length commercial terms, for use in the USA and Canada, with the exception of NRG Energy, Inc. and Edison Mission and affiliates; and 
b. | have the Debtors provide engineering services to us on terms to be agreed upon, acting reasonably; 
3. | the Debtors pay pro-rata any third party broker fees and legal fees, if any, that are subsequent costs associated with the Supplemental Agreement; and 
4. | the Debtors retain possession of, yet make a pilot-scale scrubber available for rental to our company at a nominal cost. 

 On June 11, 2013, we submitted 24,336,229 common shares of EnviroTechnologies to EnviroTechnologies for cancellation pursuant to our debt settlement agreement with EnviroTechnologies and EnviroResolutions dated May 17, 2013.
 
Pursuant to a debt settlement agreement dated May 17, 2013 among our company, EnviroTechnologies and EnviroResolutions, on November 22, 2013, our company was transferred a 40% shareholding in PREL by GEPL (who had, prior to this transfer, held all the issued and outstanding shares of PREL). PREL is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom.
 
PREL was incorporated by GEPL to develop a 79MWe waste to energy power station at Peterborough, United Kingdom (the “Peterborough Plant”). The Peterborough Plant has full planning permission at 79MWe and environmental agency permits. It is understood that the Peterborough Plant will be built in two stages at a total capital cost of approximately GBP£500 million (approximately US$824,534,442). As of May 17, 2013, PREL owns 20% of Energy Park Investments Limited, the holding company that is currently intended to finance the development of the Peterborough Plant in turn through its wholly owned operating subsidiary Energy Park Peterborough Limited.
 
On June 17, 2013, we entered into and closed share exchange agreements with certain shareholders of EnviroTechnologies. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreements we agreed to acquire 8,061,286 issued and outstanding common shares of EnviroTechnologies from the shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 806,132 shares of common stock of our company.

Competition
 
We face competition from various companies involved in the environmental technology industries and specifically companies involved in filtering of pollutants.
 
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. In order for us to successfully compete in our industry we will need to:

● | establish our product’s competitive advantage with customers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a comprehensive marketing system; and 
● | increase our financial resources. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
 
As we are a newly-established company, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as lack of available funds. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of research, operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark, except for the following:
 
We now own the proprietary emission abatement systems, currently known as ENVI-Clean™, ENVI-Pure™, for removing acid gases, particulate matter, dioxins, VOCs and other regulated hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels, and ENVI-SEA™, scrubber that can be applied to diesel exhaust emissions that require sulphur and particulate matter abatement, previously owned or controlled by the Debtors, and includes, without limitation, all developments, improvements, and derivative works based upon or incorporating the Technology, all work product created by the Debtors, and all intellectual property in the foregoing.
 
The ENVI-Clean™ system has protected intellectual property rights throughout most of the world. Its technology is protected by Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application no. PCT/CA210/000988 filed June 25, 2010 with a priority filing date of June 25, 2009. The International Preliminary Report on Patentability for this PCT application considered all patent claims of the application to be patentable. EnviroTechnologies has pending national or regional phase patent applications claiming priority from PCT/CA2010/000988 covering 127 countries. Once patents issue, patent rights in this technology will generally endure until June 25, 2030.
 
Further, we own the rights to the US provisional patent application no. US 61/614696 for the integrated wet scrubbing system. Additionally, we own the rights to US provisional patent application no. US 61/645874 for the flooded wet scrubbing head patent.

Government Regulations
 
Some aspects of our intended operations will be subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules and regulations in North America and worldwide relating to, among other things, worker safety and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. For example, we are subject to the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the principal federal legislation regulating hazardous waste generation, management and disposal.
 
Under some of the laws regulating the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Laws of this nature often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the removal or remediation of pollutants and may impose civil and criminal penalties for violations. Some of the laws and regulations authorize the recovery of natural resource damages by the government, injunctive relief and the imposition of stop, control, remediation and abandonment orders. The costs arising from compliance with environmental and natural resource laws and regulations may increase operating costs for both us and our potential customers. We are also subject to safety policies of jurisdictional-specific Workers Compensation Boards and similar agencies regulating the health and safety of workers.
 
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our intended business. At this time, we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental or various regulations and requirements.
 
While our intended projects or business activities have been designed to produce environmentally friendly green energy or other alternative products for which no specific regulatory barriers exist, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs and decreasing potential demand for our technologies, products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Both Sichel Limited and Pacific Green Group Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Hookipa Trust. Pacific Green Group Limited’s wholly owned subsidiary was Pacific Green Technologies Limited. As a result, we acquired Pacific Green Technologies Limited from Pacific Green Group Limited.

The sole director of Sichel is also the sole director of Pacific Green Group Limited. Further, PGG is a significant shareholder of EnviroTechnologies.
