Overview
Phibro Animal Health Corporation is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We strive to be a trusted partner with livestock producers, farmers, veterinarians and consumers who raise and care for farm and companion animals by providing solutions to help them maintain and enhance the health of their animals. We sell approximately 780 product lines in over 80 countries to approximately 3,790 customers. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products for food and companion animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle, aquaculture and dogs. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases and support nutrition to help improve animal health and well-being. We sell animal health and mineral nutrition products either directly to integrated poultry, swine and cattle producers or through animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and veterinarians.
Our products include:

● | Animal health products such as antibacterials, anticoccidials, nutritional specialty products and vaccines that help improve the animal’s health and therefore improve performance, food safety and animal welfare. Our Animal Health segment also includes antibacterials and other processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mineral nutrition products that fortify the animal’s diet and help maintain optimal health.

Antibacterials are biological or chemical products used in the animal health industry to treat or to prevent bacterial diseases, thereby promoting animal health, resulting in more efficient livestock production. Several factors contribute to limit the efficiency, weight gain and feed conversions of livestock production, including stress, poor nutrition, environmental and management challenges and disease. Antibacterials help prevent, control and treat disease in livestock, which can also lead to improved overall health of the animals, improved rate of weight gain and more efficient feed conversion. Our antibacterial products include:

● | Oxytetracycline and Neomycin. Terramycin® utilizes the active ingredient oxytetracycline and Neo-Terramycin® combines the active ingredients neomycin and oxytetracycline to prevent, control and treat a wide range of diseases in chickens, turkeys, cattle, swine and aquaculture. We sell Terramycin and Neo-Terramycin products primarily to livestock and aquaculture producers, feed companies and distributors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Virginiamycin. Virginiamycin is an antibacterial marketed under the brand names Stafac® to poultry, swine and cattle producers, Eskalin® to dairy cows and beef cattle producers and V-Max® for beef cattle producers. Virginiamycin is used primarily to prevent necrotic enteritis in chickens, treat and control Swine Dysentery and aid in the prevention or reduce the incidence of rumen acidosis and liver abscesses in cattle. Our experience in the development and production of virginiamycin has enabled us to develop significant intellectual property through trade secret know-how, which has helped protect against competition from generics. We are the sole worldwide manufacturer and marketer of virginiamycin. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mineral Nutrition
Our mineral nutrition products principally include inorganic and organic compounds of copper, zinc, cobalt, iron, selenium, manganese, magnesium and iodine.
Our mineral nutrition products also include GemStone®, our exclusive line of chelated organic trace minerals, including zinc, manganese, copper and iron glycine chelates. Our formulas feature high metal content to ensure greater mineral presence and preserve critical ration space. Each product is also highly chelated for superior bioavailability to maximize mineral absorption and minimize environmental impact. These organic trace minerals are available in a highly concentrated, easy-flowing granule.
Our mineral nutrition products also include the Vistore® portfolio of products, our chloride mineral option of value-driven trace mineral offerings. Our formulas feature high metal content to ensure optimal mineral presence and preserve critical ration space. High bioavailability also promotes maximized absorption for enhanced results and minimized waste.
Our major mineral nutrition customers are regional and national feed companies, distributors, co-ops, pre-mixers, integrated swine, beef and poultry producers and pet food manufacturers. The majority of our customers have nutrition staffs who determine their specific formulas for custom trace mineral premixes. Trace mineral costs and our selling prices fluctuate with commodity markets, and therefore, these products are price sensitive. Their sale requires a focused effort on cost management, quality control, customer service, pricing and logistics execution to be profitable.
Performance Products
Our Performance Products business manufactures and markets specialty ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We operate the business through our PhibroChem (a division of PAHC), Ferro Metal and Chemical Corporation Limited and Phibro-Tech, Inc. (“Phibro-Tech”) business units.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales organization includes sales, marketing and technical support employees. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. Together, our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses have a sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 420 employees plus approximately 190 distributors who market our portfolio of approximately 690 product lines to livestock producers, veterinarians, nutritionists, animal feed companies and distributors in over 80 countries.

14



In markets where we have a direct commercial presence, we sell our animal health and mineral nutrition products through our local sales offices, either directly to integrated poultry, swine and cattle producers or through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. Our sales representatives visit our customers, including livestock producers, veterinarians, nutritionists, animal feed companies and distributors, to inform, promote and sell our products and services. In direct service markets, our technical operations specialists provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, and training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use.
We sell our Performance Products through our local sales offices to the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We market these products predominately in the United States.
Customers
We have approximately 3,790 customers, of which approximately 3,500 customers are served by our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses. We consider a diverse set of livestock producers, including poultry and swine operations and beef and dairy farmers, to be the primary customers of our livestock products. We sell our animal health and mineral nutrition products directly to livestock and aquaculture producers and to distributors that typically re-sell the products to livestock producers. We sell our companion animal product using a distributor calling on veterinary clinics. We do not consider the business to be dependent on a single customer or a few customers, and we believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results.
We typically sell pursuant to purchase orders from customers and generally do not enter into long-term delivery contracts.
Product Registrations, Patents and Trademarks
We own certain product registrations, patents, trade names and trademarks, and use know-how, trade secrets, formulae and manufacturing techniques, which assist in maintaining the competitive positions of certain of our products. We believe that technology is an important component of our competitive position, and it provides us with low-cost positions enabling us to produce high quality products. Patents protect some of our technology, but a significant portion of our competitive advantage is based on know-how built up over many years of commercial operation, which is protected as trade secrets. We own, or have exclusive rights to use under license, approximately 315 patents or pending applications in more than 30 countries but we believe that no single patent is of material importance to our business and, accordingly, that the expiration or termination thereof would not materially affect our business.
We market our animal health products under hundreds of governmental product registrations approving many of our products with respect to animal drug safety and efficacy. The use of many of our medicated products is regulated by authorities that are specific to each country, e.g., the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada and European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”) and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in Europe. Medicated product registrations and requirements are country- and product-specific for each country in which they are sold. We continuously monitor, maintain and update the appropriate registration files pertaining to such regulations and approvals. In certain countries where we work with a third-party distributor, local regulatory requirements may require registration in the name of such distributor. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 935 Animal Health product registrations globally, including approximately 400 MFA registrations, 320 vaccine registrations and 215 registrations for nutritional specialty products. Our MFA global registrations included approximately 90 registrations for virginiamycin.
Additionally, many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds, proprietary adjuvant formulations or patented virus grouping technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement.
We seek to file and maintain trademark registrations around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product or service. We currently maintain, or have rights to use under license, approximately 2,900 trademark registrations or pending applications globally, identifying goods and services related to our business.

15



Our technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate.
Compliance with Government Regulation
Many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products require licensing by a governmental agency before marketing. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. For products that are currently subject to formal licensing by government agencies, our business relies on the ongoing approval and/or periodic re-approval of those licenses. Failure to maintain and, where applicable, renew those licenses for any reason including, but not limited to, changing regulations, more stringent technical, legal or regulatory requirements, or failure of the company or its agents to make timely, complete or accurate submissions, could result in suspension or loss of the company’s rights to market its products in one or more countries.
United States
In the United States, governmental oversight of animal nutrition and health products is conducted primarily by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and/or the FDA. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has jurisdiction over certain products applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites and shares regulatory jurisdiction of ethanol manufactured in biofuel manufacturing facilities with the FDA.
The USDA and the FDA are the agencies responsible for the safety and quality of the U.S. human food supply. The FDA regulates foods intended for human consumption and, through the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”), regulates the manufacture and distribution of animal drugs marketed in the U.S. including those administered to animals from which human foods are derived. All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals marketed in the United States, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. To protect the food and drug supply, the FDA develops technical standards for human and animal drug safety, effectiveness, labeling and Good Manufacturing Practice. The CVM evaluates data necessary to support approvals of veterinary drugs. Drug sponsors are required to file reports of certain product quality defects and adverse events in accordance with agency requirements.
The main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides is the EPA. The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the United States, pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
FDA approval of Type A/B/C Medicated Feed Articles and drugs is based on satisfactory demonstration of safety, efficacy, manufacturing quality standards and appropriate labeling. Efficacy requirements are based on the desired label claim and encompass all species for which label indication is desired. Safety requirements include target animal safety and, in the case of food animals, human food safety (HFS). HFS reviews include drug residue levels and the safety of those residue levels. In addition to the safety and efficacy requirements for animal drugs used in food-producing animals, environmental safety must be demonstrated. Depending on the compound, the environmental studies may be quite extensive and expensive. In many instances, the regulatory hurdles for a drug that will be used in food-producing animals are at least as stringent as, if not more so than, those required for a drug used in humans. In addition, certain safety requirements relating to antimicrobial resistance must be met for antimicrobial products.
The CVM Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation is responsible for reviewing information submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and sell animal drugs. A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved New Animal Drug Application (“NADA”). Virtually all animal drugs are “new animal drugs” within the meaning of the term in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An approved Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (“ANADA”) is a generic equivalent of an NADA previously approved by the FDA. Both are regulated by the FDA. The drug development process for human therapeutics can be more involved than that for animal drugs. However, because human food safety and environmental safety are issues for food-producing animals, the animal drug 

16



approval process for food-producing animals typically takes longer than for non-food-producing animals, such as companion animals.
The FDA may deny an NADA or ANADA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. There can be no assurances that FDA approval of any NADA or ANADA will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. Among the conditions for NADA or ANADA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. A manufacturing facility is periodically inspected by the FDA for determination of compliance with cGMP after an initial pre-approval inspection. Certain subsequent manufacturing changes must be approved by the FDA prior to implementation. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, monies and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure compliance. The process of seeking FDA approvals can be costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining or any failure to obtain FDA or foreign government approvals, or the suspension or revocation of such approvals, would adversely affect our ability to introduce and market our products and to generate revenue.
The issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals. The sale of antibiotics is a material portion of our business. Legislative bills are introduced in the United States Congress from time to time that, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business. One of these initiatives is a proposed bill called the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which has been introduced in almost every Congress since the mid 2000’s. To date, such bills have not had sufficient support to become law. Should statutory, regulatory or other developments result in restrictions on the sale of our products, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Virginiamycin. In November 2004, the CVM released a draft for comment of its risk assessment of streptogramin resistance for treatment of certain infections in humans attributable to the use of streptogramins in animals (the “risk assessment”). The risk assessment was initiated after approval of a human drug called Synercid® (quinupristin/dalfopristin) for treating vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREf), which led to increased attention regarding the use of streptogramins in animals. Synercid and virginiamycin (the active ingredient in our Stafac product) are both members of the streptogramin class of antimicrobial drugs. The risk assessment was unable to produce any firm conclusions as to whether, and, if so, how much, the use of virginiamycin in food animals contributes to the occurrence of streptogramin-resistant infections in humans via a foodborne pathway.
In classifying streptogramins in 2003 as a “medically important antimicrobial” (“MIA”) on the CVM’s Guidance for Industry (“GFI”) 152 list, a guidance document for evaluating the microbial safety of antimicrobial new animal drugs on food for human consumption, the FDA’s stated concern was the potential impact on use of Synercid for treating VREf in humans. In 2010, the U.S. label for Synercid was changed and the VREf indication was removed. The FDA determined that data submitted by the sponsor of Synercid failed to verify clinical benefit of the product for the treatment of VREf infections in humans. We have requested that the FDA remove the streptogramin class of antimicrobials from GFI 152 to reflect that they are not “medically important” for human therapy, however, the FDA has declined our request. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in the future in gaining the FDA’s agreement with our view that streptogramins are no longer medically important and accordingly that this antimicrobial class should be removed from the GFI 152 list of MIAs. The FDA has announced its intention to further review the GFI 152 list and to review labelling directions of products on the GFI 152 list, which may lead to increased restrictions on the use of these products.
MIAs. Effective January 2017, the CVM’s revised Veterinary Feed Directive (“VFD”) regulations, which included changes to the control and use of antimicrobial products for use in animal feed, require that affected antimicrobial products may only be used if authorized by a veterinarian in accordance with the regulations. Prior to implementation of the revised VFD regulations, many approved antimicrobial products could be obtained and used without formal veterinary authorization.

17



In January 2017, the FDA and industry, including us, completed the process of label changes for MIA products to remove production claims and to limit the use of MIAs to those uses that are considered necessary for assuring animal health, namely for the prevention, control and/or treatment of disease, and that MIA use in food-producing animals should include veterinary oversight or consultation. The label changes were the result of recommendations from the CVM, as described in GFI 213 (“New Animal Drugs and New Animal Drug Combination Products Administered in or on Medicated Feed or Drinking Water of Food-Producing Animals: Recommendations for Drug Sponsors for Voluntarily Aligning Product Use Conditions with GFI 209”) and GFI 209 (“The Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs in Food-Producing Animals”).
Carbadox. In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of carbadox (the active ingredient in our Mecadox product) via a regulatory process known as a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing (“NOOH”), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in animal tissues for longer than previously determined. The NOOH process provided Phibro with an opportunity to defend the safety of carbadox prior to the FDA taking final steps to remove carbadox from the market. Over the next four years, as part of an ongoing process of responding to the inquiries from the FDA’s Center of Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”), we provided extensive and meticulous research and data that confirmed the safety of carbadox. In March 2018, the FDA indefinitely stayed the withdrawal proceedings. In July 2020, the FDA announced it does not agree with Phibro’s scientific conclusions that carbadox is safe under the current conditions of use. Instead of proceeding to a hearing on the scientific concerns raised in the 2016 NOOH, consistent with the normal regulatory procedure, the FDA announced that it was withdrawing the current NOOH, and issuing a proposed order to review the regulatory method for carbadox. The approved regulatory method determines if there are residues of carcinogenic concern in animal tissue at the time of slaughter. If the order is finalized, the FDA has indicated it plans to issue a new NOOH proposing the withdrawal of carbadox from the market because of a lack of an approved regulatory method.
In September 2020, Phibro commented on the proposed order, reiterating the safety of carbadox and the appropriateness of the regulatory method, and further offered to work with the CVM to generate additional data to support the existing regulatory method or select a suitable alternative regulatory method. Phibro disagreed with the agency’s actions and submitted a request to the FDA Office of the Commissioner that the agency continue the NOOH process it started in 2016 and proceed with a hearing to review the substantial body of data supporting the safety of carbadox. 
In March 2022, the FDA held a Part 15 virtual public hearing seeking data and information related to the safety of carbadox. Phibro has continued an ongoing process of responding collaboratively and transparently to CVM’s inquiries to provide extensive and meticulous research and data that confirm the safety of carbadox. Carbadox has been approved and sold in the United States for 50 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases in swine, including Salmonella and Swine Dysentery. In the event the FDA continues to assert that carbadox should be removed from the market, we will argue that we are entitled to and expect to have a full evidentiary hearing on the merits before an administrative law judge. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of carbadox sales will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of Mecadox (carbadox) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were $21 million. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mecadox continues to be available for use by swine producers.
Manufacturing. The FDA routinely carries out audits related to cGMP standards for manufacturing facilities that make veterinary drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients approved for sale in the U.S. The FDA inspectors may make observations during these inspections, which may require corrective action in order for the manufacturing facility to remain in compliance with cGMP standards. Failure to take such corrective actions could result in the manufacturing facility being ineligible to receive future FDA approvals. In very serious cases of noncompliance with cGMP standards, the FDA may issue a warning letter which could result in products produced in such manufacturing facilities to be ineligible for sale in the U.S. Although it is our objective to remain in full conformance with U.S. cGMP standards, we have in the past received adverse observations and may in the future receive adverse observations or warning letters. Failure to comply with cGMP standards could have a material impact on our business and financial results.
European Union
European Union (“E.U.”) legislation requires that veterinary medicinal products must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the European Union. A veterinary medicinal product must meet 

18



certain quality, safety, efficacy and environmental criteria to receive a marketing authorization. The European Medicines Agency (and its main veterinary scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use) and the national authorities in the various E.U. Member States, are responsible for administering this regime.
A separate E.U. regime applies to feed additives. It provides for a re-registration process for existing additives and this process is ongoing. For certain types of additives, the authorizations are not generic in nature (so that they can be relied upon by any operator) but are limited to the company that obtained the marketing authorization. They are known as Brand Specific Approvals (“BSA”). The system is similar to the U.S. system, where regulatory approval is for the formulated product or “brand.”
The EFSA is responsible for the E.U. risk assessment regarding food and feed safety. Operating under the European Commission, in close collaboration with national authorities and in open consultation with its stakeholders, the EFSA provides independent scientific advice and communication on existing and emerging risks. The EFSA may issue advice regarding the process of adopting or revising European legislation on food or feed safety, deciding whether to approve regulated substances such as pesticides and food additives, or developing new regulatory frameworks and policies, for instance, in the field of nutrition. The EFSA aims to provide appropriate, consistent, accurate and timely communications on food safety issues to all stakeholders and the public at large, based on the Authority’s risk assessments and scientific expertise. The containment of antimicrobial resistance is one of the key areas of concern for the EFSA, EMA, the European Commission and its Directorates, the European Parliament and European Member State Governments.
A number of manufacturers, including us, submitted dossiers in order to re-register various anticoccidials for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval from the European Commission. The BSA for our nicarbazin product was published in October 2010. Our reauthorization submission was made on time and is pending. We sell nicarbazin under our own BSA and as an active ingredient for another marketer’s product that has obtained a BSA and is sold in the European Union. Similarly, a BSA for our semduramicin product, Aviax, was published in 2006 and our reauthorization submission was made on time and is pending. We have submitted a dossier for reauthorization in accordance with the requirements of the EFSA and responded to requests for additional information from the EFSA by submitting additional data for each product. The current BSAs remain valid while the EFSA reviews the additional data we have submitted. There can be no guarantee that these submissions will be reviewed favorably or in a timely manner. Failure to gain reauthorization in a timely manner could have an adverse financial impact on our business.
The Delegating and Implementing Acts under E.U. Regulation 2019/6 includes provisions that could require animals or animal origin products imported into the E.U. from other countries to be produced under the same conditions as are required in the E.U. This may preclude the use of veterinary products not approved in the E.U. or require animal health products to be used in the manner approved in the E.U. If such restrictions are implemented, they could result in a reduction or elimination of the use of our products, especially our antibacterial products, in countries that export animals or animal origin products to the E.U. and other countries that align their regulations with E.U. regulations.
Brazil
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (“MAPA”) is the regulatory body in Brazil responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives for animal use. MAPA’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives.
Other Countries
We are subject to regulatory requirements governing investigation, clinical trials and marketing approval for animal drugs in many other countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory approval process includes similar risks to those associated with the FDA and European Commission approvals set forth above.

19



Global policy and guidance
Country-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. With the exception of Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, most other countries’ regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius Commission, the recognized international standard-setting body for food (“Codex”), before establishing their own standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. It provides risk assessments and safety evaluations of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products as well as exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs in traded food commodities. These internationally published references may also be used by national authorities when setting domestic standards. We work with the national authorities to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain.
In July 2014, the Codex adopted risk management advice language for a number of compounds including carbadox. The advice language states “authorities should prevent residues of carbadox in food. This can be accomplished by not using carbadox in food producing animals.” The advice language is to provide advice only and is not binding on individual national authorities, and almost all national authorities already have long-established regulatory standards for carbadox, including prohibiting the use of carbadox in swine production within their territory, prohibiting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, or permitting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox provided there is no detection of carbadox residues in the meat. The advice language may be considered by national authorities in making future risk management determinations. To the extent additional national authorities elect to follow the advice and prohibit the use of carbadox in food-producing animals and/or the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, such decisions could have an adverse effect on our sales of carbadox in those countries or in countries that produce meat for export to those countries.
Advertising and promotion review
Promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those approved claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products.
Food Safety Inspection Service/Generally Recognized As Safe
The FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including “generally recognized as safe” or “GRAS” substances, and food and feed additives), as well as prescribing safe conditions of use. The FDA, which has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, together with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the food safety branch within the USDA, maintain the authority in the United States to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat, milk and poultry products.
Competition
We are engaged in highly competitive industries and, with respect to all our major products, face competition from a substantial number of global and regional competitors. Some competitors have greater financial, R&D, manufacturing and other resources than we have. Our competitive position is based principally on our product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility locations and product prices. We face competition in every market in which we participate. Many of our products face competition from products that may be used as an alternative or substitute.
There has been, and there may continue to be, consolidation in the animal health market, which could strengthen our competitors. Our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we 

20



will have sufficient resources to maintain our current competitive position, however, we believe the following strengths create sustainable competitive advantages that will enable us to continue our growth as a leader in our industry:
Products Aligned with Need for Increased Protein Production
Increased scarcity of natural resources is increasing the need for efficient production of food animals such as poultry, swine and cattle. Our animal health products, including our MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products, help prevent and manage disease outbreaks and enhance nutrition to help support natural defenses against diseases. These products are often critical to our customers’ efficient production of healthy animals. Our leading MFAs product franchise, Stafac/V-Max/Eskalin, is approved in over 30 countries for use in poultry, swine and cattle and is regarded as one of the leading MFA products for production animals. Our nicarbazin and amprolium MFAs are globally recognized anticoccidials. Our nutritional specialty product offerings such as OmniGen-AF and Animate are used increasingly in the global dairy industry, and Magni-Phi and Provia Prime/MicroLife Prime are rapidly becoming important products for poultry producers. Our vaccine products are effective against critical diseases in poultry, swine and cattle.
Global Presence with Existing Infrastructure in Key High-Growth Markets
We have an established direct presence in many important emerging markets, and we believe we are a leader in many of the emerging markets in which we operate. Our existing operations and established sales, marketing and distribution network in over 80 countries provide us with opportunities to take advantage of global growth opportunities. Outside of the United States, our global footprint reaches to key high growth regions (countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate) including Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Southeast Asia, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada and South Africa and other countries in Africa. Our operations in countries outside of the United States contributed approximately 59% of our Animal Health segment revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Leading Positions in High Growth Sub-sectors of the Animal Health Market
We are a global leader in the development, manufacture and commercialization of MFAs and nutritional specialty products for the animal health market. We believe we are well positioned in the fastest growing food animal species segments of the animal health market with significant presence in poultry and swine. We believe our sales of MFA products were third largest in the animal health market.
Diversified and Complementary Product Portfolio with Strong Brand Name Recognition
We market products across the three largest livestock species (poultry, cattle and swine) and aquaculture and in the major product categories (MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products). We believe our diversity of species and product categories enhances our sales mix and lowers our sales concentration risk. The complementary nature of our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition portfolio provides us with unique cross-selling opportunities that can be used to gain access to new customers or deepen our relationships with existing customers. We believe we have strong brand name recognition for the Phibro name and for many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products, and we believe Phibro vaccines are recognized as an industry standard in efficacy against highly virulent disease challenges. Our diverse portfolio of products also allows us to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions.
Experienced Sales Force and Technical Support Staff with Strong, Consultative Customer Relationships
Within our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition segments, utilizing both our sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 420 employees and a broad distribution network, we market our portfolio of more than 690 product lines to livestock producers and veterinarians in over 80 countries. We interact with customers at both their corporate and operating level, which we believe allows us to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs. Our technical support and research personnel are also important contributors to our overall sales effort. We have a total of approximately 120 technical, field service and quality control/quality assurance personnel throughout the world. These professionals interface directly with our key customers to provide practical solutions to derive optimum benefits from our products.

21



Experienced, Committed Employees and Management Team
We have a diverse and highly skilled team of animal health professionals, including technical and field service personnel located in key countries throughout the world. These individuals have extensive field experience and are vital to helping us maintain and grow our business. Many of our field team have more than 20 years of experience in the animal health industry and many have been with us for more than 10 years.
We have a strong management team with a proven track record of success at both the corporate and operating levels. The executive management team has diverse backgrounds and on average more than 30 years of experience the animal health or related industry.
Human Capital
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,860 employees in 55 locations spanning 26 countries. Certain of our Brazilian employees are covered by multi-employer regional industry-specific unions. Certain of our Israeli employees are covered by site-specific collective bargaining agreements. Certain employees are covered by individual employment agreements. 
We strive to nurture a strong culture that empowers team members and provides opportunities for growth and development. The Denison Organization Culture survey was administered to all employees globally in 2017 and 2021, with at least a 75 percent response rate each time. Phibro employee engagement and commitment scores remained consistent in 2017 and 2021 at 82 percent favorable for engagement and 76 percent favorable for commitment. We are intently focused on maintaining these results across the organization.
At Phibro we view the strength of our team as a critical component of our success. The following principles, which guide our decisions and actions, provide an overview of how we approach management of human capital resources.
Our Most Valuable Asset – The Company and its Employees
We recognize that our employees provide the competitive edge needed to compete successfully in world markets. We adhere to human resources policies and practices that meet the needs of the business and the individual, so that we can attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Talent development is a strategic priority at Phibro, and we offer opportunities for growth at all levels of the company. Our goal is to ensure we have the right colleagues with the right skills in the right roles and with the appropriate support to build leadership capabilities and drive organizational results. As business priorities evolve and we seek to innovate, we work to nurture and develop current talent to best serve future needs. We take a programmatic and focused approach to developing our people. 
Achievement of business objectives and the fulfillment of individual career aspirations are reinforced by our competitive compensation and benefit programs, comprehensive training and development programs, health and safety programs that promote and safeguard employees’ well-being, and work environments that are conducive to the successful application of skills and knowledge. In addition to traditional professional development, we offer a robust, cloud-based online training curriculum from one of the leading providers of development material for learning-focused organizations. 
Employee safety is paramount. In 2017, we launched the Road to Zero initiative, which utilizes teaming concepts to elevate employee involvement in project-based improvement activities. Participation drives a strong culture of safety and quality. Road to Zero provides a formal system for engagement, shared responsibility, leadership opportunities, meaningful contributions and accountability. We have and will continue to take the necessary daily precautions as recommended by local government authorities to keep our employees safe.
Strength Through Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)
We create a positive and supportive work environment for our employees. Our approach enables opportunity for inclusion and encourages diverse perspectives and thinking to maximize the achievement of innovative and successful outcomes. We aim to protect employees from being discriminated against because of gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, race, religion, political beliefs, ethnic background, country of origin, language or non-job-related disabilities, and we follow these same principles when recruiting new talent to our organization. We implemented a new 

22



DEI training program to foster awareness and acceptance across our administration, R&D and manufacturing facilities in 2022.
Respecting Employees 
Phibro employees are our greatest strength and most valuable asset. When we equip team members to apply their skills, talent and passions to contribute and make a positive impact, everyone succeeds. When we thrive as individuals and teams, the Company thrives. We promote from within wherever possible, safeguard the confidentiality of employee records and keep employees informed of issues affecting them.
Cultivating One Leader at a Time 
Our proprietary Leadership Model is a framework that guides how our people plan and act to advance company priorities. We strive for each executive/manager/employee to be consistently challenged to:

● | See what needs to be done (strategy, vision, growth),
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Get it done (execution), and
--+-----------------------------


● | Get it done the right way (how you do it).
--+-------------------------------------------

Recognizing that leadership may be exhibited differently by an individual contributor versus a first-line manager versus an upper-level manager, all Phibro employees are consistently expected to demonstrate leadership behaviors.
Manufacturing
The Animal Health business segment manufactures many products internally and supplements that production with contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) as necessary.
We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our antibacterial and anticoccidial products in Guarulhos, Brazil and Braganca Paulista, Brazil. We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our anticoccidial and antimicrobial products in Neot Hovav, Israel. We produce vaccines in Beit Shemesh, Israel, Sligo, Ireland and Omaha, Nebraska. We produce adjuvants in Omaha, Nebraska. We produce pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and other animal health products in Petach Tikva, Israel. We produce certain of our nutritional specialty products in Quincy and Chillicothe, Illinois and Sarasota, Florida. We produce certain of our mineral nutrition products in Quincy, Illinois and Omaha, Nebraska.
We supplement internal manufacturing and production capabilities with CMOs. We purchase certain active pharmaceutical ingredients for other medicated products from CMOs in China, India and other locations. We then formulate the final dosage form in our facilities and in contract facilities located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.
We purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Such raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company’s business.
We believe that our existing facilities, as supplemented by CMOs, are adequate for our current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future.
Research and Development
Most of our manufacturing facilities have chemists and technicians on staff involved in product development, quality assurance, quality control and providing technical services to customers. Research, development and technical service efforts are conducted by our veterinarians (DVMs) and nutritionists at various facilities.
We operate Animal Health R&D and product testing at our facilities in: Guarulhos, Brazil; Beit Shemesh, Israel; Neot Hovav, Israel; Ma’ayan Tzvi, Israel; Quincy, Illinois; Corvallis, Oregon; State College, Pennsylvania; Sarasota, Florida; Manhattan, Kansas; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Omaha, Nebraska. We also engage various independent contract research organizations to undertake research and development activities.

23



These facilities provide R&D services relating to: fermentation development and micro-biological strain improvement; vaccine development; chemical synthesis and formulation development; nutritional specialty product development; and ethanol-related products.
Environmental, Health and Safety
Our operations and properties are subject to Environmental Laws (as defined below) and regulations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to attain and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws. While we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations, including for odor releases in Guarulhos, Brazil. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring to address contamination associated with historical operations. We maintain accruals for costs and liabilities associated with Environmental Laws, which we currently believe are adequate. In many instances, it is difficult to predict the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred.
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations. Violators of Environmental Laws may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. Failure to comply with Environmental Laws may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of operations and/or permits, limitations on production, or increased operating costs. In addition, private plaintiffs may initiate lawsuits for personal injury, property damage, diminution in property value or other relief as a result of our operations. Environmental Laws, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, potentially resulting in substantial future costs or capital or operating expenses. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or the cost of compliance. Based upon our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
The following summarizes the principal Environmental Laws affecting our business.
Waste Management.   Our operations are subject to statutes and regulations addressing the contamination by, and management of, hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes. In the United States, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws, generally impose strict joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and related liabilities, on defined classes of “potentially responsible parties” (“PRPs”). PRPs can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. We have been, and may become, subject to liability under CERCLA for cleanup costs or investigation or clean up obligations or related third-party claims in connection with releases of hazardous substances at or from our current or former sites or offsite waste disposal facilities used by us, including those caused by predecessors or relating to divested properties or operations.
We must also comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state laws regulating the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws impose management requirements on generators and transporters of such wastes and on the owners and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities. As current or historic recyclers of chemical waste, certain of our subsidiaries have been, and are likely to be, the focus of extensive compliance reviews by environmental regulatory authorities under RCRA. Our subsidiary Phibro-Tech currently has a RCRA operating permit for its Santa Fe Springs, California facility, for which a renewal application is under review. Phibro-Tech initially submitted an application for renewal of its permit for the Santa Fe Springs facility in 1996. We are unable to predict when the State of California will issue a draft permit for public review and comment. Until the State of California issues its final decision on the renewal application, the facility is continuing to operate under the exiting permit. Phibro-Tech has updated its permit application on several occasions, and DTSC has approved a number of permit modifications to the existing permit. In addition, because we or our subsidiaries have closed several facilities that had been the subject of RCRA permits, we or our 

24



subsidiaries have been and will be required to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination conditions at these shutdown plant sites within the requirements of RCRA corrective action programs.
Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended.   We must comply with regulations related to the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States without governmental authorization, including those pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
Chemical Product Registration Requirements.   We must comply with regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, labeling, registration and safety analysis of our products in order to distribute many of our products, including, for example, in the United States, the federal Toxic Substances Control Act and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and in the European Union, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (“REACH”).
Air Emissions.   Our operations are subject to the U.S. Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable U.S. state and foreign statutes and regulations, which regulate emissions of various air pollutants and contaminants. Certain of the CAA’s regulatory programs are the subject of ongoing review and/or are subject to ongoing litigation, such as the rules establishing new Maximum Achievable Control Technology for industrial boilers; significant expenditures may be required to meet current and emerging air quality standards. Regulatory agencies can also impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other air quality regulations. States may choose to set more stringent air emissions rules than those in the CAA. State, national and international authorities have also issued requirements focusing on greenhouse gas reductions. In the United States, the EPA has promulgated federal greenhouse gas regulations under the CAA affecting certain sources. In addition, a number of state, local and regional greenhouse gas initiatives are also being developed or are already in place. In Israel and Brazil, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol requirements regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions consists of energy efficiency regulations, carbon dioxide emissions allowances trading and renewable energy requirements.
Capital Expenditures
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental, health and safety regulations were $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. See “Business — Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations” for further descriptions. Our environmental capital expenditure plans cover, among other things, the currently expected costs associated with known permit requirements relating to facility improvements.
Contamination and Hazardous Substance Risks
Investigation, Remediation and Monitoring Activities.   Certain of PAHC’s subsidiaries that are currently or were historically engaged in recycling and other activities involving hazardous materials have been required to perform site investigations at their active, closed and former facilities and neighboring properties. Contamination of soil, groundwater and other environmental media has been identified or is suspected at several of these locations, including Santa Fe Springs, California; Powder Springs, Georgia; Union, Illinois; Sewaren, New Jersey; Sumter, South Carolina; and Joliet, Illinois, and regulatory authorities have required, and will continue to require, further investigation, corrective action and monitoring over future years. These subsidiaries also have been, and in the future may be, required to undertake additional capital improvements as part of these actions. In addition, RCRA and other applicable statutes and regulations require these subsidiaries to develop closure and post-closure plans for their facilities and in the event of a facility closure, obtain a permit that sets forth a closure plan for investigation, remediation and monitoring and requires post-closure monitoring and maintenance for up to 30 years. We believe we are in material compliance with these requirements and maintain adequate reserves to complete remediation and monitoring obligations at these locations.
In connection with past acquisitions and divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us, or may in the future require us, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites we no longer own or operate. Under the terms of the sale of the former facility in Joliet, Illinois, Phibro-Tech remains responsible for any required investigation and remediation of the site attributable to conditions at the site at the time of the February 2011 sale date, and we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover the cost of the remediation.
PRP at Omega Chemical Superfund Site.   The EPA is investigating and planning for the remediation of offsite contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Corporation Superfund Site (“Omega Chemical Site”), which is upgradient of Phibro-Tech’s Santa Fe Springs, California facility. The EPA has entered into a settlement 

25



agreement with a group of companies that sent chemicals to the Omega Chemical Site for processing and recycling (“OPOG”) to remediate the contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Site in accordance with a general remedy selected by EPA. The EPA has named Phibro-Tech and certain other subsidiaries of PAHC as PRPs due to groundwater contamination from Phibro-Tech’s Santa Fe Springs facility that has allegedly commingled with contaminated groundwater from the Omega Chemical Site. In September 2012, the EPA notified approximately 140 PRPs, including Phibro-Tech and the other subsidiaries, that they have been identified as potentially responsible for remedial action for the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site and for EPA oversight and response costs. Phibro-Tech contends that any groundwater contamination at its site is localized and due to historical operations that pre-date Phibro-Tech and/or contaminated groundwater that has migrated from upgradient properties. In addition, a successor to a prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site has asserted that PAHC and Phibro-Tech are obligated to provide indemnification for its potential liability and defense costs relating to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. PAHC and Phibro-Tech have vigorously contested this position and have asserted that the successor to the prior owner is required to indemnify Phibro-Tech for its potential liability and defense costs. Furthermore, several members of OPOG filed a complaint under CERCLA and RCRA in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against many of the PRPs allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (including Phibro-Tech) for contribution toward past and future costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site, and the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, sent Phibro-Tech and certain other PRPs a pre-litigation notice letter in August 2022 regarding potential CERCLA Sec. 107 cost recovery claims seeking unrecovered past costs related to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site, along with a declaration allocating liability for future costs. Due to the ongoing nature of the EPA’s investigation, the preliminary stage of the ongoing litigation and Phibro-Tech’s dispute with the prior owner’s successor, at this time we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what, if any, liability Phibro-Tech or the other subsidiaries may ultimately have for investigation, remediation and the EPA oversight and response costs associated with the affected groundwater plume.
Potential Claims.   In addition to cleanup obligations, we could also be held liable for all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage, which liability may not be covered by insurance.
Environmental Accruals and Financial Assurance.   We have established environmental accruals to cover known remediation and monitoring costs at certain of our current and former facilities. Our accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded by calculating our best estimate of probable and reasonably estimable future costs using current information that is available at the time of the accrual. Our accruals for environmental liabilities totaled $4.3 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021.
In certain instances, regulatory authorities have required us to provide financial assurance for estimated costs of remediation, corrective action, monitoring and closure and post-closure plans. Our subsidiaries, in most instances, have chosen to provide the required financial assurance by means of surety bonds or letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2022, surety bonds and letters of credit provided $12.4 million of financial assurance.
Workplace Health and Safety
We are committed to manufacturing safe products and achieving a safe workplace. Our Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) Global Director, along with regional and site-based EHS professionals, manage environmental, health and safety matters throughout the Company. The site managers are responsible for implementing the established EHS controls. To protect employees, we have established health and safety policies, programs and processes at all our manufacturing sites. An external EHS audit is performed at each of our sites as needed based on the conditions at the respective sites.
Where You Can Find More Information
We are subject to the information and periodic and current reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and, in accordance therewith, will file periodic and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such periodic and current reports, proxy statements and other information will be available to the public on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and through our website at www.pahc.com.
