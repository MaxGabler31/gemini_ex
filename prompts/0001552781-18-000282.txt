Sales and Marketing Strategy US and South Africa
 
We provide a cloud-based loan origination software platform that enables businesses grant loans, sell products, pay bills and monthly subscription on terms. Our marketing activities to date in South Africa have primarily consisted of contacting potential sales leads and making presentations and attending a once a year conference that we attend with the Micro Finance South Africa.
 
With respect to our marketing campaign in both the US and South Africa, we plan to implement an all-in-one software platform that will enable us to manage and provide an inbound marketing experience to our customers. At the core of this platform will be a single inbound database that captures its customer activity throughout the customer lifecycle. The platform will use our centralized inbound database to empower us to create more personalized interactions with customers, such as personalized social media alerts, personalized websites, personalized emails and targeted alerts for sales people. This all-in-one platform is a marketing automation software solution, currently available on the market that we plan to buy and implement in our business.

Government Regulation
 
Our customers’ products and services are subject to extensive US local, state and federal regulation and South Africa regulations. The regulation of the loan products and services industry is intended primarily for the protection of consumers and is constantly in flux as new regulations are introduced and existing regulations are repealed, amended, and modified.
 
US Regulation
 
Federal
 
Lending Laws.

Our customers’ businesses are subject to the federal Truth in Lending Act and its underlying regulations, known as Regulation Z, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. These laws require the Company to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against unfair credit practices. The principal disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act are intended to promote the informed use of consumer credit. Under the Truth in Lending Act, when acting as a lender, a company is required to disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits a company from discriminating against any credit applicant based on any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age, and requires the Company to notify credit applicants of any action taken on the individual’s credit application.
Consumer Reports and Information.

The use of consumer reports and other personal data used in credit underwriting is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws governing the use of consumer credit information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes requirements that apply to the use of “consumer reports” and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers where their loan application has been denied because of information contained in their consumer report. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires a company to promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by a company to a consumer reporting agency.
 
Information-Sharing Laws.

Our customers are also subject to the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which limits the sharing of information with affiliates for marketing purposes and requires the Company to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and responding appropriately to mitigate identity theft and to adopt various policies and procedures and provide training and materials that address the importance of protecting non-public personal information and aid a company in detecting and responding to suspicious activity, including suspicious activity that may suggest a possible identity theft red flag, as appropriate.
 
Marketing Laws.

Our customers’ advertising and marketing activities are subject to several federal laws and regulations including the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements in all aspects of a company’s business. In furtherance of consumer protection, the Federal Trade Commission provides guidance and enforces federal laws concerning truthful advertising and marketing practices; fair financial practices in lending, loan servicing and debt collection; and protection of sensitive consumer information. As a financial services company, any advertisements related to a company’s products must also comply with the advertising requirements set forth in the Truth in Lending Act. Also, any of a company’s telephone marketing activities must comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telephone Sales Rule. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act prohibits the use of automatic telephone dialing systems for communications with wireless phone numbers without the express consent of the consumer, and the Telephone Sales Rule established the Do Not Call Registry and sets forth standards of conduct for all telemarketing. A company’s advertising and marketing activities are also subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to the source of content.

Military Lending Laws
 
In July 2015, the Department of Defense published a finalized set of new rules under the Military Lending Act. The Military Lending Act (and rules previously adopted thereunder) restricts credit companies from offering its short-term unsecured credit products to members of the military or their dependents because none of the Company’s short-term unsecured credit products carry a military annual percentage rate of 36% or less. The new rule expands the scope of the credit products covered by the Military Lending Act to include certain non-purchase money loans secured by personal property or vehicles and certain unsecured installment loan products to the extent any of such products have a military annual percentage rate greater than 36. The rules under the Military Lending Act contain various disclosure requirements, limitations on renewals and refinancing and other restrictions, including restrictions on the use of prepayment penalties, arbitration provisions and certain waivers of rights. The rule provides that a lender is subject to fines and other penalties if it extends credit to a member of the military or a military dependent on terms prohibited by the rule. The new rule does provide a safe harbor for a lender if it verifies a potential borrower’s military status before extending credit by checking the Department of Defense’s database or a database of a national credit-reporting agency that provides military status information. In addition, Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate on existing loans when the consumer becomes an active-duty member of the military during the life of a loan, or the spouse of an active duty member of the military during the life of the loan. In accordance with federal law, the interest rate must be reduced to 6% per year on amounts outstanding during the time in which the service member is on active duty.
Funds Transfer and Signature Authentication Laws.

Our customers’ business is also subject to the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act and various other laws, rules and guidelines relating to the procedures and disclosures required for debiting or crediting a debtor’s bank account relating to a consumer loan (i.e., ACH funds transfer). Furthermore, our customers are also subject to various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed to obtain and authenticate e-signatures.
Debt Collection Practices.

Additionally, our customers’ CSO programs are required by both federal and some state laws to comply with the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Our customers also use the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act as a guide in connection with operating its other collection activities. Our customers are also required to comply with all applicable state collection practices laws.
 
Privacy and Security of Non-Public Customer Information.

Our customers are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, our customers must disclose to consumers its privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of consumers’ nonpublic personal information with third parties. This disclosure must be made to consumers when the customer relationship is established and, in some cases, at least annually thereafter. These regulations also require a company to ensure that its systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. These regulations also dictate certain actions that it must take to notify consumers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions.

Our customers are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which a company must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of its business activities. In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibits a company from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
 
In July 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which authorized the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to regulate a variety of consumer finance transactions. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers over non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, like us. The CFPB has explicit supervisory authority to: (i) examine and require registration of providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of consumer loans such as us; (ii) adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being “unfair,” “deceptive,” or “abusive,” and hence unlawful; and (iii) impose recordkeeping obligations. We do not currently know the nature and extent of the rules the CFPB will consider for consumer loan products and services such as those offered by us or the timeframe in which the CFPB may consider such rules.
 
The CFPB has indicated that it intends to systematically gather data to obtain a complete understanding of the consumer loan market and its impact on consumers, and the CFPB has also released its Short-Term, Small-Dollar Lending Procedures, which, in conjunction with the CFPB’s supervision and examination manual is the field guide CFPB examiners will use when examining small-dollar lenders such as Advance America. The CFPB’s examination authority permits CFPB examiners to inspect our books and records and ask questions about our business. The CFPB’s examination procedures include specific modules for examining marketing activities, loan application and origination activities, payment processing activities, sustained use by consumers, collection activities, defaults, consumer reporting and third-party relationships. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional expenses to monitor and comply with CFPB regulations. Althou.gh the CFPB does not have the authority to regulate fees or interest rates, it is possible that the CFPB could propose and adopt rules that would make short-term consumer lending products and services materially less profitable or even impractical to offer, which could force us to modify or terminate certain of our product offerings in the United States. The CFPB also could adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to other consumer loan products and services. Any such rules may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition or could make the continuance of all or part of our current U.S. business impractical or unprofitable.
 
In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act’s grant of regulatory and supervisory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB’s own rules). In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB. If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 
Other Federal Laws
 
Our customers’ products and services are subject to a variety of other federal laws and regulations, such as the Truth-in-Lending Act (“TILA”), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the “PATRIOT Act”), and the regulations promulgated under each. Among other things, these laws require disclosure of the principal terms of each transaction to every customer, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices, and proscribe unfair credit practices. TILA and Regulation Z, adopted under TILA, require disclosure of, among other things, the pertinent elements of consumer credit transactions, including the dollar amount of the finance charge and the charge expressed in terms of an annual percentage rate.
 
11

 

Our customers’ marketing efforts and representations made about their loan advances are subject to federal and state unfair and deceptive practices statutes. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act and the state attorneys general and private plaintiffs enforce the analogous state statutes.
 
Federal Legislative Proposals
 
Various anti-cash advance legislation has been proposed or introduced in the U.S. Congress. Federal and state legislators continue to receive pressure from consumer advocates and other industry opposition groups to adopt such legislation. In 2008 and 2009, bills were introduced in the U.S. Congress that would have placed a cap of 36% on the effective annual percentage rate (“APR”) on all consumer loan transactions. Another bill would have placed a 15-cents-per-dollar borrowed ($0.15/$1.00) cap on fees for cash advances and would have implemented other consumer protections. Other bills have been introduced that would have limited to six the number of cash advances a customer would be permitted to receive in any 12-month period. Any federal legislation or regulation that places restrictions on cash advances and similar services could have a material adverse effect on our customers’ business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Any federal law that would impose a 36% APR limit or prohibit or severely restrict cash advance services may eliminate our customers’ ability to continue their current operations and in turn negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.
State and Local Regulations
 
Our customers’ consumer loan business is regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes and is also subject to various local rules and regulations. The scope of state regulation, including the fees and terms of a company’s consumer loan products and services, varies from state to state. The terms of our customers’ loan products and services will vary from state to state to comply with the laws and regulations of the states in which it operates. The states with laws that specifically regulate the consumer loan products and services typically limit the principal amount of a consumer loan and set maximum fees or interest rates that customers may be charged. Most states also limit a customer’s ability to renew a short-term consumer loan and require various disclosures to consumers. State statutes often specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for consumer loans and, in some cases, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions. Our customers’ collection activities regarding past due amounts are subject to consumer protection laws and state regulations relating to debt collection practices. In addition, some states require certain disclosures or content to accompany a company’s advertising and marketing materials. Also, some states require a company to report loan activity to statewide databases and restrict the number and/or principal amount of loans a consumer may have outstanding at any time or over the course of a period, typically twelve months. The local rules and regulations vary widely from city to city. The most restrictive local rules and regulations relate to zoning and land use restrictions; however, local jurisdictions’ efforts to regulate or restrict the terms of a consumer loan product have recently increased, predominantly in the State of Texas.
 
In states or jurisdictions where the credit facilities offer CSO programs, our customers are required to comply with that jurisdiction’s Credit Services Organization Act, Credit Access Business law or a similar statute. These laws generally define the services that the Company can provide to consumers and require the Company to provide a contract to the customer outlining the Company’s services and the cost of those services to the customer. In addition, these laws may require additional disclosures to consumers and may require the Company to be registered with the jurisdiction and/or be bonded.
 
Over the last few years, legislation that prohibits or severely restricts our customers’ loan products and services or the profitability of the loan products and services has been introduced or adopted in a number of states.
 
South Africa Credit Regulations (The National Credit Act)
 
The National Credit Act (“NCA”) regulates the South Africa credit industry and was designed to protect consumer in the credit market and make credit and banking services more accessible. The Purpose of the NCA Act is to: promote a fair and non-discriminatory market place for access to consumer credit; regulate consumer credit and improve standards of Consumer information; prohibit certain unfair credit and credit marketing practices; promote responsible credit granting and use; prohibit reckless credit granting; provide for debt re-organization in case of over-indebtedness; to regulate credit information; and establish recourse for unfair credit practices. The NCA does this by simplifying and standardizing credit agreements and information disclosure; providing for the use of simple language that is easy to understand for comparing credit agreements from different credit providers; ensures all credit products are handled in the same way by credit providers; assisting over-indebted Consumers to restructure their debt with the help of a Debt Counselor (DC) and encourage responsible lending; regulates credit bureaus in terms of their Consumer information and records; establishing the National Credit Regulator (NCR) to regulate the entire credit market; and establishing the National Consumer Tribunal (CT) to adjudicate on Consumer complaints and disputes with credit providers, contraventions of The Act and decisions of the Regulator.
 
12

 

The NCA affects anyone dealing with the credit industry such as credit grantors, credit grantees and intermediaries. The NCA defines a “credit agreement” broadly as any installment purchase agreement of goods or services, as well as the extension of credit in the form of money i.e. home loans, personal loans, credit cards, store cards and short-term loans. Therefore, a credit agreement applies to any party involved in the credit agreement which is classified into three categories namely incidental credit agreements; intermediate agreements; and large credit agreements.
 
Credit Providers include banks, micro lenders, retailers such as furniture and clothing stores, all businesses, companies, close corporations, partnerships and individuals who do business on credit, provide loans or charge interest on overdue accounts. Consumers Include natural person, companies, close corporations, trusts (with more than three individual trustees), partnerships and an association of persons whose asset value or annual turnover, together with the combined asset value or annual turnover of all related juristic persons, at the time the agreement is made, equals or exceeds the threshold value of 1 million rands.
 
The NCA lists a number of consumer rights, which are protected by the Act. A party who breaches Consumer rights protected by the NCA commits an offence in terms of credit law, which enables Consumer recourse through the established dispute channels. The following are Consumer rights protected in the NCA:
 

☐ | To apply for credit
--+--------------------


☐ | To be protected against discrimination in the granting of credit 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | To be informed why credit has not been granted, should you ask 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | To have your personal and financial information treated confidential

The key points of the NCA are:
 
1. Marketing
 
The NCA restricts and prohibits certain practices of loan canvassing such as door to door selling, uninvited canvassing at workplaces or homes. The NCA also increased control over marketing practices and advertisements such as automatic credit limit increases and negative option marketing i.e. if you do not decline, we will assume you agree. In addition, the National Credit Act provides for clear and understandable marketing communication. Consumers must receive a detailed written quote, which is valid for 5 business days, to enable quote comparisons from different credit providers.
2. Capped Interest Rates and Other Fees and Charges
 
The NCA effectively caps the interest rates, fees and other charges, which credit providers, can charge, depending on the type of credit and when the credit was granted. The maximum interest rate, in most cases, is based on a formula, which is dependent on the SA Reserve Bank Repurchase (Repo) rate at the time that the credit was granted. Essentially, there are seven rate categories namely mortgage agreements; credit cards/facilities; unsecured credit transactions; short-term credit transactions; developmental credit agreements; other credit agreements and incidental credit agreements. The NCA places a cap on the maximum amount that a credit provider can charge for other fees such as initiation fees, monthly service, and default and collection costs. While a loan protection policy is permitted, the charges must “be reasonable” and the Consumer may use/cede an existing insurance cover.

3. Loan Application
 
The NCA requires credit providers to supply simple contracts that are easy to understand, in two official languages and the Consumer must receive a free copy. Consumers are also entitled to a reason, on request, when the credit provider denies credit. The NCA requires credit providers to do due diligence to ensure the Consumer can afford the loan and all loans must be recorded on a register to prevent Consumers becoming over-indebted.
4. Reckless Lending
 
Credit providers are in contravention of the NCA and may be judged guilty of reckless lending if the Consumers ability to afford loan repayments is not assessed before granting credit. Credit providers may be subject to severe penalties and may even forfeit their right to recover the debt if they are judged guilty of reckless lending. However, Consumers who failed to fill in the loan application fully and honestly are not protected by the NCA.
5. Debt Counselor & Counseling
 
The NCA gives Consumers the right to apply for financial management and debt counseling assistance if he or she is unable to pay their debts. The Debt Counselor (DC) is registered by the NCR after successful course and exam completion. Debt counselors will help over-indebted Consumers restructure/rearrange their debt repayments, this process can be voluntary or made an order of the court.
 
All DCs must be registered with the National Credit Regulator and fees are prescribed in terms of the NCA. Consumers must understand and accept the process, charges and payments before undergoing debt counseling. Once the Consumer has signed for debt counseling, the credit bureau is notified, and the Consumer will be unable to obtain further credit for the duration of debt counseling until the process is finalized/withdrawn.
 
6. Credit Bureau
 
The NCA requires all credit bureau to be registered with and submit reports to the National Credit Regulator. Credit bureau are required to ensure data is accurate at all times and that inaccurate information is immediately removed without cost to the Consumer after the Consumer has lodged a complaint. The NCA regulations stipulate how Credit bureau information is obtained, used, and for how long it should remain on a Consumer’s profile.
 
In addition, Consumers are eligible for one free credit report from each credit bureau each year to effectively manage their credit profiles.
 
7. The National Credit Regulator and the Consumer Tribunal
 
The NCA established the NCR to regulate the credit industry and ensure that credit providers comply with the NCA. In addition, the NCR is responsible for investigating and evaluating Consumer complaints about alleged contraventions of the NCA by credit providers. All credit providers, credit bureau and debt counselors must register and report to the NCR.
 
In addition to the NCR, the NCA established the Consumer Tribunal with equal status to a court of law to hear and adjudicate on: applications made in terms of the NCA by consumers; credit providers and credit bureau; debt counselors and the NCR including applications for interim relief and a review of the NCR’s decisions; matters referred to by the NCR or complaints related to allegations of prohibited
