Item 1. Business
Overview
DISCO provides a cloud-native, artificial intelligence-powered legal solution that simplifies ediscovery, legal document review and case management for enterprises, law firms, legal services providers and governments. Our scalable, integrated solution enables legal departments to easily collect, process and review enterprise data that is relevant or potentially relevant to legal matters. We leverage a cloud-native architecture and powerful artificial intelligence, or AI, models to automatically identify legally relevant documents and improve the accuracy and speed of legal document review. Our AI models continuously learn from legal work conducted on our solution and can be reused across legal matters, which further strengthens our ability to help our customers find evidence and resolve matters faster as they expand usage of our solution. We provide legal departments with the ability to centralize legal data into a single solution, improving security and privacy for our customers, enabling transparent collaboration with other legal industry participants and allowing customers to reuse data and lawyer work product across legal matters. By automating the manual, time-consuming and error-prone parts of ediscovery, legal document review and case management, we empower legal departments to focus on delivering better legal outcomes.
Since our incorporation in 2013, and beginning with our founders, DISCO has assembled a team that combines strength in software engineering, cloud computing and AI, with deep legal expertise and a rich understanding of the problems that lawyers and legal professionals face and how they work. This combination of expertise means that our team is distinctly well-positioned to execute on our vision of building technology that powers the legal function across companies in every industry.
Our focus on delivering a solution that legal professionals value is coupled with a simple and transparent usage-based business model. We believe this enables our customers to easily adopt our solution, realize rapid time-to-value, scale their usage within and across applications to match their changing needs and collaborate with others. This has allowed us to build a powerful product-led growth engine that efficiently expands the usage of our solution for more legal matters and use cases within organizations, spreads our solution across the legal ecosystem through collaboration and word-of-mouth and increases the value of our solution as we collect and process more data and lawyers do more legal work in our solution. The success of this growth model is underscored by our dollar-based net retention rate of 146% as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,126 enterprises, law firms, legal services providers and government organizations as DISCO customers. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the definition of dollar-based net retention rate.
Law affects everyone, from the largest multinational corporations to local mom-and-pop businesses, from the most powerful national governments to the smallest towns and from major civic organizations to individual citizens. The impact of law on the business world is only growing, with businesses today operating in more jurisdictions than ever before and increasingly exposed to a growing number of constantly changing laws and regulations that can materially damage a company’s brand and operations. This has turned the corporate legal function into a mission-critical, strategic component of the modern enterprise and contributed to the growth in global spend on legal services. But despite its enormous scale and attractive opportunities for automation and the application of AI to improve lawyer productivity and job satisfaction, the legal industry has lagged behind other industries in digitization and cloud technology adoption.
Legal work often requires lawyers to collect and review enterprise data to determine the facts. This process includes ediscovery, which refers to the process of collecting, searching and producing digital enterprise data that can constitute documentary evidence and legal document review, which refers to the substantive review of collected digital enterprise data by legal professionals to determine the facts and final evidence in a legal matter. Today, many legal departments rely on a complex and services-heavy network of law firms, legal services providers and legacy point solutions for ediscovery and legal document review. This fragmented, multi-vendor approach is extremely manual, difficult to use and ill-suited to handle the massive growth in the volume, variety and velocity of enterprise data that legal departments are experiencing, which ultimately limits the productivity of legal professionals and their ability to resolve legal matters quickly and on favorable terms. However, recent technological advances such as AI and cloud computing have reached a point of technological maturity where they can enable legal technology applications to transform legal work and automate much of the previously manual, time-consuming work done by legal professionals. At the same time, we believe rapid growth in use of consumer software and other consumer technology, including the proliferation of mobile devices, the generational shift of lawyers and the increasing career mobility of lawyers, are all contributing to a radical change in expectations for legal technology used in the workplace.
Our Solution
Since our inception, our principal goal has been to create experiences that feel “magical” to lawyers, by delivering intuitive, intelligent offerings that are well-tailored to lawyers’ workflows and a joy for legal professionals to use. Our solution is enabled by our deep investment in a modern, scalable cloud architecture that accelerates application development; makes our offerings robust, scalable and secure; and enables us to act as a secure single system of record and engagement for all legal data at enterprise scale. We have built our solution to incorporate the latest advances in automation and AI directly into existing lawyer workflows to multiply lawyer productivity across the ediscovery and legal document review lifecycle. Our cloud-native, AI-powered software is augmented with deep expertise, consultative professional services and flexible customer support that enables us to be a single-source provider and meet the diverse needs of customers in every industry. With our full-stack solution, legal departments no longer need to rely on a fragmented network of slow, antiquated processes and law firms and service providers manually collecting, searching and reviewing documents. We believe this reduces legal costs, increases lawyer productivity and improves legal outcomes. We intend to extend our solution and apply it to other kinds of legal work over time, enabling us to compete for an increasing share of global spend on legal services.
Our full-stack solution currently includes:
•DISCO Ediscovery automates much of the ediscovery process, saving legal departments from costly and cumbersome manual tasks associated with collecting, processing, enriching, searching, reviewing, analyzing, producing and using enterprise data that is at issue in legal matters.
•DISCO Review is AI-powered document review that consistently delivers legal document reviews that are high quality, on time and on budget.
•DISCO Case Builder allows legal professionals to collaborate across teams to effectively build a compelling case by offering a single place to search, organize and review witness testimony and other important legal data.
Key Benefits of Our Solution
Our end-to-end solution was designed to improve the everyday experience of lawyers and legal professionals and improve legal outcomes for legal departments. We deliver the following key benefits:
•Full Stack and Turnkey. We enable customers to consume our offerings in a self-service way or as a turnkey, full-stack solution, giving our customers the flexibility to tailor their ediscovery and legal document review processes to their own legal work strategy and use different combinations of our offerings on different subsets of their legal work. The availability of our full-stack solution removes the need for our customers to manage workflows and data transfer between multiple services providers and point solutions, freeing up legal professionals to focus on higher value legal work. Additionally, because we use DISCO Ediscovery internally to deliver DISCO Review, we are able to maintain a tight feedback loop that accelerates improvement of our solution and training of our AI models, increasing the effectiveness of our overall solution for all customers over time. Our cloud-native, AI-powered solution is augmented with deep expertise, consultative professional services and flexible customer support, enabling us to be a single-source provider and meet the diverse needs of customers across industries.
•High End-User Satisfaction Driven by Applications Built for Lawyers and Other Legal Professionals. We strive to create product experiences that feel “magical” to lawyers: intuitive, easy to use, powerful and comprehensive. Our cloud-native architecture delivers a level of performance comparable to the consumer applications that modern lawyers use every day. Our applications bring sophisticated technology, such as AI, to bear at the right points in a legal workflow in a way that feels natural and is not intimidating to the end user. These characteristics of our solution encourage and accelerate widespread adoption by lawyers and other legal professionals, which in turn accelerates the time to value for our customer.
•Increased Accuracy and Quality of Review. Our solution allows lawyers to use AI and analytics integrated into a lawyer-friendly and highly automated workflow to increase the accuracy and quality of legal reviews. These innovations allow lawyers to spend less time finding and fixing human errors and managing the routing of documents through lawyer workflows and more time on higher value tasks that require legal judgment. Customers can realize these benefits either by leveraging DISCO Review or using DISCO Ediscovery as the solution on which existing law firms and legal services providers conduct legal document review themselves.
•Faster Resolution of Legal Matters with Better Outcomes. Our solution enables lawyers to determine the facts and use those facts to assess legal matters and produce evidence more quickly. We believe this enables 
them to resolve legal matters faster, which can result in significantly reduced legal costs and the reduction or avoidance of legal risks across their full portfolio of legal matters.
•Scalable, Secure, Single System of Record and Engagement for Legal Data. The scalability, performance and extensibility of our cloud-native architecture allows customers to use DISCO as a secure single system of record and engagement for all enterprise data related to legal matters at enterprise scale. This enhances the security and integrity of our customers’ enterprise data involved in legal matters, provides fine-grained control over user access to this data and the workflows users employ and empowers lawyers to easily search, visualize and interact with the complete corpus of enterprise data involved in legal matters in real time and in one place. With a single system of record and engagement, our AI models can continuously learn from all of a customer’s data and legal work product across all legal matters, enabling our customers to gain insights from legal work performed in earlier legal matters to accelerate legal work in subsequent legal matters.
•Cost Flexibility and Predictability. Our single, end-to-end solution replaces the fragmented landscape of solutions and vendors historically used by legal departments. The solutions we replace often include separate, high and unpredictable costs for different parts of the ediscovery and legal document review process, such as processing, the review platform, analytics and infrastructure. By contrast, our simple, all-in pricing model and flexible terms align with our customers’ needs, are easy to understand and guarantee costs for our customers, allowing legal departments to improve cost predictability and budget planning.
Our Customers
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,126 customers, increasing from 825 as of December 31, 2020. Our customers include a diverse set of enterprises across a broad set of industries, as well as law firms, legal services providers of all sizes and governmental organizations. While we serve customers across many different industries, the way in which lawyers and legal professionals use our solution is similar regardless of the specific industry in which each customer operates. This commonality has created efficiencies in our sales and marketing and product development efforts because we do not need to tailor them to a wide range of different customer use cases.
We define a customer as an entity that we have a contract with and from whom we have recognized revenue during the preceding month. Legal departments that use our solution and use many law firms across their legal matters, as well as law firms and service providers that use our solution for multiple clients, are each treated as one customer. Regardless of who we contract with, the ultimate payer is almost always the corporate legal department, with law firms and service providers passing on our bills to their client for reimbursement.
In 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue and less than 10% of our revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States.
Our Growth Strategies
We are pursuing multiple levers for future growth:
Fuel the DISCO Product-Led Growth Engine
•Maintain and Advance Our Innovation and Brand. We intend to keep combining our deep legal domain expertise and commitment to world-class software engineering to continue delivering features that lawyers love and introducing new applications to address more areas of legal work.
•Add New Customers. We believe we have a significant opportunity to further grow our customer base and our market leadership and differentiated solution will enable us to efficiently acquire new customers across all channels. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,126 customers, increasing from 825 customers as of December 31, 2020.
•Increase Usage and Penetration Within Our Existing Customer Base. We believe that we will be able to continue expanding customer relationships by increasing customers’ usage of applications that they already buy from us, selling more of our existing applications to existing customers, and, in the future, introducing additional applications to sell to existing customers. 
Extend our Reach
•Expand Our Sales Coverage and Establish a Digital Sales Channel. We intend to continue to increase our salesforce headcount in strategic locations across the United States and globally. Additionally, we plan to develop a digital, self-service sales channel that can simplify the sales process and enable customers to easily adopt our solution through our website without the need to speak with a sales representative.
•Expand Internationally. Our market is global and we have a significant opportunity to expand internationally. In 2021, less than 10% of our revenue was generated by customers outside of the United States.
•Extend and Strengthen Our Channel Partnerships and Integrations. We intend to cultivate and leverage channel partners to grow our market presence, enhance the virality of our solution and drive greater sales efficiency.
•Expand Our Offering Portfolio. We intend to leverage our technology to introduce further offerings that increase lawyer productivity across more and more areas of legal work over time.
•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Strategic Investments. We intend to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments that we believe can expand the functionality and value of our solution and bring talent to our company. 
Our Employees and Culture
We believe that great achievements come from aiming great people at big problems, and that our employees, who we call “Discovians,” are the principal driver of our success. We strive to attract, retain, develop and promote humble, curious and empathetic Discovians across all areas of our business. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that values input from every corner of our business and creating an environment where all people feel welcome and connected regardless of their background. Our culture is guided by the principles we set forth in our MAGIC core values: Meaningful impact, All-in, Grit and grace, Innovation and Craft. These principles shape our culture and guide the way we work, support each other and our communities and serve our customers. We believe that our culture and commitment to giving back to our community are critical to advancing our mission of using technology to strengthen the rule of law. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion is a cornerstone of our strategy in this regard: we are committed to making DISCO a place where all people feel welcome and connected regardless of their background. Our aim is to build a company where great people can do the work of their lives and where every Discovian can see the impact that their work has on advancing our mission of using technology to strengthen the rule of law. We believe one of the greatest contributors to satisfaction at work is working with people who are good at their jobs and who are also good human beings. We have focused on building a culture that encourages bold experimentation and innovation and that is rigorous about measuring the results of our innovation so that we can direct investment toward ideas that work and away from ideas that do not. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity and other incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors. As of December 31, 2021, we had 470 full-time employees.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solution through a direct sales force which is organized based on the stages of our sales motion. Our sales organization includes sales development representatives, field sales, inside sales, solution architects and our customer success team. Our sales development representatives are responsible for finding and initiating contact with prospective customers, booking initial meetings with our sales team and demonstrating our applications. Our field and inside sales teams are responsible for converting interested prospects into DISCO customers and then expanding our relationship with existing customers by increasing their usage of our applications and cross-selling additional applications. Our solution architects provide deep expertise in our technology and are responsible for providing current and prospective clients with technical and workflow sales consulting. Once a customer is signed, our customer success team is responsible for onboarding our customers and driving user adoption in each customer organization. Our customer success professionals maintain ongoing relationships with users at our customers and partner with our sales team to secure referrals and capture upsell opportunities.
In addition to our direct sales force, we also sell through legal services providers who buy our applications and resell them to their own customers, often in combination with professional services. The customers of our customers who are legal services providers are generally legal departments and law firms. Some of our law firm customers additionally buy our 
applications for the purpose of reselling them to their clients, who are legal departments, often in combination with professional services and legal services.
One particular area of focus of our sales team is the conversion of users into customers. Our typical entry into an organization is through lawyers at corporate legal departments and law firms. These or other customers also use our applications to collaborate with other legal industry participants who may or may not be our customers. For example, a legal department may add users who work at law firms that are not yet our customers. We aim to proactively secure referrals to other prospective customers as well as converting users of our solution who are not yet customers.
Our marketing activities are focused on building our brand reputation, increasing awareness of our solution among potential customers, converting users into customers and otherwise driving customer demand. We reach potential customers and generate leads for our sales team through a combination of customer prospecting, content marketing, social media, digital marketing, public relations, event marketing and sponsorships. We also incorporate lead generation directly into our product experience, with buttons that enable our customers to easily increase their usage, add new applications and engage our experts for additional support. Additionally, we believe we have an attractive opportunity to develop a more robust digital sales channel that can further facilitate efficient, self-service adoption by our customers.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and delivery of our cloud-native solution and platform. We believe that our substantial and continued investment in research and development, including hiring top engineering talent, in conjunction with our focus on having lawyers and legal professionals involved in every aspect of the product development process is critical to expanding our leadership position and developing applications that seem magical to our users. Additionally, our product development process and roadmap are informed by the continuous feedback we receive from Discovians who use our software as part of our DISCO Review offering and in our support and professional services organization.
Our Competition
Our market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Almost all potential customers have existing solutions for ediscovery and legal document review in place, which typically consists of a mix of on-premise point solutions and human professional services. To win new customers, we must displace these incumbent solutions.
We believe our competitors fall into several categories:
•Legal services providers. Competitors in this category include large dedicated legal services providers such as Consilio LLC, Epiq Systems, Inc. and KLDiscovery Inc., the legal services divisions of large professional services firms such as Deloitte & Touche LLP, Ernst and Young LLP, KPMG LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and a large number of smaller regional and local legal services providers. Certain law firms also provide ediscovery solutions and legal document review services to their clients that may compete with our solutions for discrete matters.
•Legacy on-premise software. Competitors in this category include Nuix Limited, Open Text Corporation, Relativity ODA LLC, or Relativity, RELX PLC and Thomson Reuters Corporation, as well as many other smaller software companies.
•Cloud software. Competitors in this category include Everlaw, Inc., Logik Systems, Inc. (d.b.a. Logikcull), Relativity through its RelativityOne product offering and Reveal Data Corporation as well as many other smaller software companies.
In addition, we expect to expand our solution to address additional areas of the legal function and we will likely face further competition from existing companies in such areas.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•level of user satisfaction;
•ease of deployment, implementation and use;
•scalability, reliability, security and performance;
•breadth of offering;
•solution features and capabilities;
•accuracy, quality and speed of review;
•ability to connect multiple stakeholders in a cloud-based solution;
•quality and use of AI;
•comprehensiveness, quality and availability of support and professional services;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•cost and predictability of costs.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customers, substantially greater financial and technical resources and larger sales and marketing budgets than we do.
Intellectual Property
We rely on certain intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights with respect to employees, contractors, customers and partners. 
We have certain registrations (and applications for registration) for intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2021, we held three U.S. granted patents and 11 pending U.S. patent applications. Our three issued U.S. patents are scheduled to expire on June 28, 2037. As of December 31, 2021, we held one registered U.S. trademark. As of December 31, 2021, we held seven domain names in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. The existence of a pending application is not an assurance that it will issue or lead to a registration.
Government Regulation
Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive and evolving U.S. federal, state and foreign laws, rules and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the organizations and other authorities governing the legal profession in the jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate. In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and the collection, storage, processing, transfer and other use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, unencumbered internet access to our solution, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. See the section titled “Risk Factors - Risks related to Litigation, Regulatory Compliance and Governmental Matters - We operate in a highly regulated industry and either are or may be subject to a wide range of federal, state and local, as well as foreign, laws, rules and regulations and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may force us to change our operations or harm our business.”
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located in Austin, Texas, where we lease approximately 49,000 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires in October 2022. This office is leased, and we do not own any real property. We may lease or purchase additional space as needed to accommodate our needs.
