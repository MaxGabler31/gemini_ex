 Item 1. Business
General General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (sometimes referred to as we, us, our, the Company, or GM Financial), the wholly-owned captive finance subsidiary of General Motors Company (GM), is a global provider of automobile finance solutions. On October 31, 2017, we completed the sale of certain of our European subsidiaries and branches (collectively, the European Operations) to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. The results of operations of the European Operations are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,

GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.

2017 and 2016. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our disposal of these operations. Unless otherwise indicated, information contained herein relates to our continuing operations. 
We offer substantially similar products and services throughout many different regions, subject to local regulations and market conditions. We evaluate our business in two operating segments: North America (the North America Segment) and International (the International Segment). Our global footprint covers approximately 90% of GM’s worldwide market. Except as otherwise specified, amounts presented within the tables are stated in millions.
North America Segment Our North America Segment includes operations in the U.S. and Canada. We have been operating in the automobile finance business in the U.S. since September 1992. Our retail automobile finance programs include full credit spectrum lending and leasing offered through GM-franchised dealers under the GM Financial brand. We also offer a sub-prime lending product through non-GM-franchised and select independent dealers under the AmeriCredit brand. Our sub-prime lending program is designed to serve customers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions. Therefore, we generally charge higher rates than those charged by banks and credit unions and expect to sustain a higher level of credit losses than on prime lending. Our commercial lending programs are offered to our GM-franchised dealer customers and their affiliates.
International Segment Our International Segment includes operations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, as well as our equity investments in joint ventures in China. Certain of our international operations were originally a part of General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the former captive finance subsidiary of GM. Due to this longstanding relationship, the international operations have substantial business related to GM and its dealer network. The retail lending and leasing programs in our International Segment focus on financing new GM vehicles and select used vehicles. We also offer finance- and/or vehicle-related insurance and other products.
Retail Finance In our retail finance business the term "loan" refers to retail installment contracts we purchase from automobile dealers or other vehicle financing products. We also purchase lease agreements for new GM vehicles.
Marketing As an indirect auto finance provider, we focus our marketing activities on automobile dealers. We primarily pursue franchised dealerships; however, we also conduct business with a limited number of independent dealerships. We generally finance new GM vehicles, moderately-priced new vehicles from other manufacturers, and later-model, low-mileage used vehicles. 
We maintain non-exclusive relationships with the dealers and actively monitor our dealer relationships with the objective of maximizing the volume of retail financing applications received from dealerships with whom we do business that meet our underwriting standards and profitability objectives. Due to the non-exclusive nature of our relationships with dealers, the dealers retain discretion to determine whether to obtain financing from us or from another source for a customer seeking to make a vehicle purchase. 
Subvention Programs GM offers subvention programs, under which GM provides us cash payments in order for us to be able to provide for lower customer payments on loan and lease agreements originated through GM's dealership network, making credit more affordable to customers financing or leasing vehicles manufactured by GM. GM also supports our loan origination volume by offering other incentives to borrowers who finance their vehicles with us. 
Origination Data Our business strategy is to help GM sell vehicles while earning an appropriate risk-adjusted return. This includes increasing new GM automobile sales by offering a full spectrum of competitive financing programs. Total retail loan and lease origination levels were as follows:

 | Years ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
New GM vehicles | $ | 44,124 | | | $ | 40,326 | | $ | 35,044
Other vehicles | 4,650 | | | 5,015 | | | 4,645
Total | $ | 48,774 | | | $ | 45,341 | | $ | 39,689

Underwriting We utilize proprietary credit scoring systems to support our credit approval process. The credit scoring systems were developed through statistical analysis of customer demographics, credit bureau attributes and portfolio databases and are tailored to each country where we conduct business. Credit scoring is used to differentiate credit applications and to statistically rank-order credit risk in terms of expected default rates, which enables us to evaluate credit applications for approval, contract pricing and structure. 
In addition to our proprietary credit scoring systems, we utilize other underwriting guidelines. These underwriting guidelines are comprised of numerous evaluation criteria, including, but not limited to: (i) identification and assessment of the applicant's willingness and capacity to repay the loan or lease, including consideration of credit history and performance on past and existing

obligations; (ii) credit bureau data; (iii) collateral identification and valuation; (iv) payment structure and debt ratios; (v) insurance information; (vi) employment, income and residency verifications, as considered appropriate; and (vii) in certain cases, the creditworthiness of a co-obligor. These underwriting guidelines and the minimum credit risk profiles of applicants we will approve, as rank-ordered by our credit scorecards, are subject to change from time to time based on economic, competitive and capital market conditions as well as our overall origination strategies.
Servicing Our business strategy includes increasing the loyalty and retention of GM customers through our customer service activities. Our servicing activities include collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer inquiries, initiating contact with customers who are delinquent, maintaining our security interest in financed vehicles, arranging for the repossession of financed vehicles, liquidation of collateral and pursuit of deficiency balances when appropriate. 
Operating Leases Our operating leases are closed-end leases; therefore, we assume the residual risk on the leased vehicle. The lessee may purchase the leased vehicle at the maturity of the lease by paying the purchase price stated in the lease agreement, which equals the contract residual value determined at origination of the lease, plus any fees and all other amounts owed under the lease. If the lessee decides not to purchase the leased vehicle, the lessee must return it to a dealer by the lease's scheduled lease maturity date. Extensions may be granted to the lessee for up to six months. If the lessee extends the maturity date on their lease agreement, the lessee is responsible for additional monthly payments until the leased vehicle is returned or purchased.
We seek to maximize net sales proceeds on returned leased vehicles. Net sales proceeds equal gross proceeds less fees and costs for reconditioning and transporting the leased vehicles. We sell returned leased vehicles through either our exclusive online channel or our wholesale auction partners.
Commercial Finance Commercial lending products include floorplan financing, also known as wholesale or inventory financing, which is lending to finance vehicle inventory, as well as dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, and to finance dealership real estate. Other commercial products include financing for parts and accessories, dealer fleets and storage centers.
Floorplan Financing We support the financing of new and used vehicle inventory primarily for our GM-franchised dealerships and their affiliates before sale or lease to the retail customer. Financing is provided through lines of credit extended to individual dealerships. In general, each floorplan line is secured by all financed vehicles and by other dealership assets and, when available, the continuing personal guarantee of the dealership's owners. Under certain circumstances, such as repossession of dealership inventory, GM and other manufacturers may be obligated by applicable law, or under agreements with us, to reassign or to repurchase new vehicle inventory within certain mileage and model year parameters, further minimizing our risk. The amount we advance to a dealership for new vehicles purchased through the manufacturer is equal to 100% of the wholesale invoice price of new vehicles, which includes destination and other miscellaneous charges, and a price rebate from the manufacturer to the dealer in varying amounts stated as a percentage of the invoice price. We advance the loan proceeds directly to the manufacturer. To support a dealership's used vehicle inventory needs, we advance funds to the dealership or auction to purchase used vehicles for inventory based on the appropriate wholesale book value for the region in which the dealer is located.
Floorplan lending is typically structured to yield interest at a floating rate indexed to an appropriate benchmark rate. The rate for a particular dealership is based on, among other things, the dealership's creditworthiness, the amount of the credit line, the dealer's risk rating and whether or not the dealership is in default. Interest on floorplan loans is generally payable monthly. GM offers floorplan interest subvention, under which GM makes payments to us to cover certain periods of interest on certain floorplan loans. Upon the sale or lease of a financed vehicle, the dealer must repay the advance on the vehicle according to the repayment terms. These repayment terms may vary based on the dealer's risk rating. As a result, funds advanced may be repaid in a short time period, depending on the length of time the dealer holds the vehicle until its sale. 
We periodically inspect and verify the location of the financed vehicles that are available for sale. The timing of the verifications varies and no advance notice is given to the dealer. Among other things, verifications are intended to determine dealer compliance with its credit agreement as to repayment terms and to determine the status of our collateral.
As part of our floorplan lending agreement, we offer a cash management program. Under the program, subject to certain conditions, a dealer may choose to reduce the amount of interest on their floorplan line by making principal payments to us in advance. This program allows for the dealer to manage their liquidity position and reduce their cost of funds, while maintaining the repayment terms on the advances made associated with new vehicles. 
Dealer Loans We also make loans to finance parts and accessories as well as improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital and to purchase and finance dealership real estate. These loans are typically secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on dealership land and buildings, security interests in other dealership assets and often the continuing personal guarantees from the owners of the dealerships and/or the real estate, as applicable. Dealer loans are structured to yield interest at fixed or floating rates, which are indexed to an appropriate benchmark rate. Interest on dealer loans is generally payable monthly.

Underwriting Each dealership is assigned a risk rating based on various factors, including, but not limited to, capital sufficiency, operating performance, financial outlook and credit and payment history, if available. The risk rating affects loan pricing and guides the management of the account. We monitor the level of borrowing under each dealership's account daily. When a dealer's outstanding balance exceeds the availability on any given credit line with that dealership, we may reallocate balances across existing lines, temporarily suspend the granting of additional credit, increase the dealer's credit line or take other actions following an evaluation and analysis of the dealer's financial condition and the cause of the excess or overline. Under the terms of the credit agreement with the dealership, we may call the floorplan loans due and payable and receive payment typically within 60 days of the call.
Servicing Commercial lending servicing activities include dealership customer service, account maintenance, credit line monitoring and adjustment, exception processing and insurance monitoring. Our commercial lending servicing operations are centralized in each country.
Sources of Financing We primarily finance our loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of our secured and unsecured credit facilities, through public and private securitization transactions and through the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets. Generally, we seek to fund our operations through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk, although we may issue debt globally in order to diversify funding sources, especially to support U.S. financing needs. As such, the mix of funding sources varies from country to country based on the characteristics of our earning assets and the relative development of the capital markets in each country. We actively monitor the capital markets and seek to optimize our mix of funding sources to minimize our cost of funds. 
Secured Credit Facilities Some loans and leases are funded using secured credit facilities with participating banks providing financing either directly or through institutionally-managed conduits. Under these funding agreements, we transfer financial assets to special purpose finance subsidiaries. These subsidiaries, in turn, issue notes to the bank participants or agents, collateralized by such financial assets. The bank participants or agents provide funding under the notes to the subsidiaries pursuant to an advance formula, and the subsidiaries forward the funds to us in consideration for the transfer of financial assets. While these subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements, these subsidiaries are separate legal entities and the assets held by these subsidiaries are legally owned by them and are not available to our creditors or creditors of our other subsidiaries. Advances under these secured credit facilities bear interest at commercial paper, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, The Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate or prime rates plus a credit spread and specified fees, depending upon the source of funds provided by the bank participants or agents. In certain markets in the International Segment, we also finance loans through the sale of receivables to banks under a full recourse arrangement.
Unsecured Credit Facilities We utilize both committed and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities as an additional source of funding. The financial institutions providing the uncommitted facilities are not obligated to advance funds under them. GM also provides us with financial resources through a $1.0 billion unsecured intercompany revolving credit facility (the Junior Subordinated Revolving Credit Facility) and exclusive access to no less than a $2.0 billion facility (GM Revolving 364-Day Credit Facility).
Securitizations We also fund loans and leases through public and private securitization transactions. Proceeds from securitizations are used primarily to fund initial cash credit enhancement requirements in the securitization, pay down borrowings under our credit facilities, and support further originations.
In our securitizations, we transfer loans or lease-related assets to securitization trusts (Trusts), which issue one or more classes of asset-backed securities. The asset-backed securities are in turn sold to investors. When we transfer securitized assets to a Trust, we make certain representations and warranties regarding the securitized assets. These representations and warranties pertain to specific aspects of the securitized assets, including the origination of the securitized assets, the obligors of the securitized assets, the accuracy and legality of the records, schedules containing information regarding the securitized assets, the financed vehicles securing the securitized assets, the security interests in the securitized assets, specific characteristics of the securitized assets, and certain matters regarding our servicing of the securitized assets, but do not pertain to the underlying performance of the securitized assets. Upon the breach of one of these representations or warranties (subject to any applicable cure period) that materially and adversely affects the noteholders' interest in any securitized assets, we are obligated to repurchase the securitized assets from the Trust. Historically, repurchases due to a breach of a representation or warranty have been insignificant.
We utilize senior-subordinated securitization structures which involve the public and private sale of subordinated asset-backed securities to provide credit enhancement for the senior, or highest rated, asset-backed securities. The level of credit enhancement in future senior-subordinated securitizations will depend, in part, on the net interest margin, collateral characteristics and credit performance trends of the assets transferred, as well as our credit trends and overall auto finance industry credit trends. Credit enhancement levels may also be impacted by our financial condition, the economic environment and our ability to sell lower-rated subordinated bonds at rates we consider acceptable.

GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.

The credit enhancement requirements in our securitization transactions may include restricted cash accounts that are generally established with an initial deposit and may subsequently be funded through excess cash flows from the securitized assets. An additional form of credit enhancement is provided in the form of overcollateralization, whereby the value of the securitized assets transferred to the Trusts is greater than the amount due on asset-backed securities issued by the Trusts. In the International Segment, our securitization transactions may contain portfolio performance ratios or loss-based advance rate calculations which could increase the credit enhancement levels. In the North America Segment, our securitization transactions typically do not contain these performance ratios. 
Unsecured Debt We also access the capital markets through the issuance of unsecured notes and commercial paper.
Trade Names We and GM have obtained federal trademark protection for the AmeriCredit, GM Financial and GMAC names and the logos that incorporate those names. Certain other names, logos and phrases we use in our business operations have also been trademarked. The trademarks that GM and we hold are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.
Regulation Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing by governmental authorities under various national, state and local laws and regulations.
North America Segment In the U.S., we are subject to extensive federal regulation, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Additionally, we are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires us to maintain the privacy of certain consumer data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters, and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which has limitations on the interest rate charged to customers who have subsequently entered military service, and provides other protections such as early lease termination and restrictions on repossession. 
The primary federal agency responsible for ensuring compliance with these consumer protection laws is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB has broad rule-making, examination and enforcement authority over non-bank automobile finance companies like us. We are subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB as a “larger participant” in the automobile finance market.
In most states and other jurisdictions in which we operate, consumer credit regulatory agencies regulate and enforce laws relating to sales finance companies and consumer lenders or lessors like us. These laws and regulations generally provide for licensing as a sales finance company or consumer lender or lessor, limitations on the amount, duration and charges, including interest rates, requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and other documentation, and restrictions on collection practices and creditors' rights. In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to periodic examination by regulatory authorities.
In Canada, we are subject to both federal and provincial laws and regulations, including the Interest Act, the Consumer Protection Acts and Cost of Credit Disclosure regulations. Additionally, we are subject to certain provincial Consumer Reporting Acts and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, as well as provincial counterparts, which regulates how we can collect, use, and/or disclose consumers' personal information.  
International Segment In certain countries in the International Segment, we operate in local markets as either banks or regulated finance companies and are subject to legal and regulatory restrictions which vary country to country and may change from time to time. The regulatory restrictions, among other things, may require that the regulated entities meet certain minimum capital requirements, may restrict dividend distributions and ownership of certain assets, and may require certain disclosures to prospective purchasers and lessees and restrict certain practices related to the servicing of consumer accounts.  
Competition The automobile finance market is highly fragmented and is served by a variety of financial entities, including the captive finance affiliates of other major automotive manufacturers, banks, thrifts, credit unions, leasing companies and independent finance companies. Many of these competitors have substantial financial resources, highly competitive funding costs and significant scale and efficiency. Capital inflows from investors to support the growth of new entrants in the automobile finance market, as well as growth initiatives from more established market participants, has resulted in generally increasing competitive conditions. While we have a competitive advantage when GM-sponsored subvention or other support programs are offered exclusively through us to targeted GM dealers and their customers, when no subvention or other support programs are offered our competitors can often provide financing on terms more favorable to customers or dealers than we may offer. Many of these competitors also have long standing relationships with automobile dealerships and may offer the dealerships or their customers other products and services, which we may not currently provide.
