ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Liberty Property Trust (the "Trust") is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust (a "REIT"). Substantially all of the Trust's assets are owned directly or indirectly, and substantially all of the Trust's operations are conducted directly or indirectly, by its subsidiary, Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership" and, together with the Trust and their consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company").
The Company completed its initial public offering in 1994 to continue and expand the commercial real estate business of Rouse & Associates, a Pennsylvania general partnership, and certain affiliated entities (collectively, the "Predecessor"), which was founded in 1972. 
As of December 31, 2018 the Company owned the following "Properties in Operation" (square feet in thousands):
 
 | Number of Operating Industrial Properties | Number of Operating Office Properties | | Total Number of Properties | Total Square Feet
"Wholly Owned Properties in Operation" | 480 | | 22 | | 502 | 91,248 
"JV Properties in Operation" (at 100%) | 48 | | 18 | | 66 | 14,853 
"Properties in Operation" | 528 | | 40 | | 568 | 106,101

As of December 31, 2018 the Company owned the following "Properties under Development" and "Properties held for Redevelopment/Value-Added" (square feet upon completion in thousands):

 | Number of Properties | Total Square Feet | 
"Wholly Owned Properties under Development" | 29 | | 8,195 | 
"JV Properties under Development" (at 100%) | 2 | | 134 | (1)
"Properties under Development" | 31 | | 8,329 | 
"Wholly Owned Properties held for Redevelopment/Value-Added" | 7 | | 868 | 
"JV Properties held for Redevelopment/Value-Added" (at 100%) | 1 | | 48 | 
"Properties held for Redevelopment/Value-Added" | 8 | | 916 | 
(1) Including a 217-room hotel, which is excluded from square footage total. | | 

The Company also owned 1,283 acres of developable land and through unconsolidated joint ventures 339 acres of developable land substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use.
The Properties in Operation, collectively with the Properties under Development and Properties held for Redevelopment/Value-Added are referred to as, the "Properties".
As previously reported, and as further summarized below in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, the Company undertook several significant transactions in recent years consistent with its strategy to divest its remaining office Properties (other than its headquarters) and focus its efforts and capital solely on its industrial platform, which favors industrial properties and markets with strong demographic and economic fundamentals. In furtherance of this strategy, the Company has substantially divested of its suburban office Properties, and expects to divest its remaining metro-office Properties over the next few years. The Company plans to reinvest the proceeds of these divestments in acquisitions in targeted industrial markets and new development.
The Company provides leasing, property management, development and other tenant-related services for the Properties. The industrial Properties consist of a variety of warehouse, distribution, service, assembly, light manufacturing and research and development facilities. They include both single-tenant and multi-tenant facilities, with most designed flexibly to accommodate various types of tenants, space requirements and industrial uses.

The Trust is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, owning 97.7% of the common equity of the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2018. The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (the "Common Units"), other than those owned by the Trust, are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis (subject to anti-dilution protections) for the Trust's common shares of beneficial interest, $0.001 par value per share (the "Common Shares"). As of December 31, 2018, the Common Units held by the limited partners were exchangeable for 3.5 million Common Shares. The ownership of the holders of Common Units is reflected on the Trust's financial statements as “noncontrolling interest- operating partnership” as a component of total equity.

External Growth Strategies
The Company seeks to enhance its long-term profitability through the development, acquisition and disposition of properties either directly or through joint ventures. The Company also considers acquisitions of real estate operating companies.
Wholly Owned Properties
Development
The Company's development investment strategy focuses primarily on the development of high-quality industrial properties within its existing markets. When the Company's marketing efforts identify opportunities, the Company will consider pursuing such opportunities outside of the Company's established markets. The Company and its Predecessor have developed over 90 million square feet of commercial real estate during the past 46 years. The Company's development activities generally fall into two categories: build-to-suit projects and projects built for inventory (projects that are less than 75% pre-leased prior to commencement of construction). The Company develops build-to-suit projects for existing and new tenants. The Company also builds projects for inventory where the Company has identified sufficient demand at market rental rates to justify such construction. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company brought into service 16 wholly owned inventory projects totaling 4.7 million square feet and representing an aggregate Total Investment of $434.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, these completed development properties were 81.1% leased. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 29 Wholly Owned Properties under Development, which are expected to comprise, upon completion, 8.2 million square feet and are expected to represent a Total Investment of $735.0 million.

The scheduled deliveries of the 8.2 million square feet of Wholly Owned Properties under Development are as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

“Total Investment” for a Property Under Development is defined as the sum of the land costs and the costs of land improvements, building and building improvements, lease transaction costs, and where appropriate, other development costs and carrying costs.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 1,283 acres of land held for development, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use. Substantially all of the land is located adjacent to or within existing industrial or business parks with site improvements, such as public sewers, water and utilities, available for service. The Company estimates that its land holdings would support, as and when developed, approximately 15.2 million square feet. The Company's investment in land held for development as of December 31, 2018 was $296.2 million.
Through a development agreement with Kent County Council, the Company develops commercial buildings at Kings Hill, a 650-acre mixed use development site in the County of Kent, England. The Company is also the development and project manager for the installation of infrastructure on the site and receives a portion of the proceeds from the sale of serviced residential land development parcels to house builders. The Kings Hill project originally had planning consent and available land for approximately 1.35 million square feet gross of commercial space of which approximately 1.0 million square feet gross has been built as of December 31, 2018. During 2015, the Company obtained outline planning consent to re-zone some of the remaining commercial development land for a further 635 homes at Kings Hill, taking the total consent to 3,486 homes of which 2,884 had been sold as of December 31, 2018.
