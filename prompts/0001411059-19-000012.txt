ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Company invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (“KBS Capital Advisors”), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate investments. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 
On September 27, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to offer a maximum of 280,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 200,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 80,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on December 31, 2010. We sold 182,681,633 shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of $1.8 billion. We terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014. We sold 30,903,504 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $298.2 million. Also as of December 31, 2018, we had redeemed 27,140,343 of the shares sold in our offering for $251.7 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned eight office properties and an office campus consisting of five office buildings. 
On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed a special committee (the “Special Committee”) composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the Special Committee with this process. Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore provided various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives. Although the Special Committee engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.
The Special Committee determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale while it continues to explore strategic alternatives for us. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell additional assets and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. In the event of such a determination, the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval. While we anticipate that our exploration of strategic alternatives and marketing of some of our remaining assets for sale will result in additional stockholder liquidity, there is no assurance that this will be the case, nor can we give assurance that it will provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.
Our charter requires that we seek stockholder approval of our liquidation if our shares of common stock are not listed on a national securities exchange by March 31, 2018, unless a majority of our independent directors determines that liquidation is not then in the best interest of our stockholders. On March 12, 2019, the conflicts committee unanimously determined to postpone approval of our liquidation while the Special Committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us. Our charter requires that the conflicts committee revisit the issue of liquidation at least annually.
Our focus in 2019 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders; negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; complete capital projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, to attract quality buyers; and finalize our assessment of strategic alternatives.

Objectives and Strategies
Our primary investment objectives are: 

• | to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions; and


• | to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions.

We have sought and will seek to achieve these objectives by managing our portfolio of real estate investments, which we acquired using a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering and debt financing. 
Real Estate Portfolio
Real Estate Investments
We made investments in core properties, which are generally lower risk, existing properties with at least 80% occupancy and minimal near-term lease rollover. We diversified our portfolio by investment size, investment type, investment risk and geographic region. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of real estate properties was composed of eight office properties and an office campus consisting of five office buildings encompassing 4.6 million rentable square feet. 
We originally intended to hold our core properties for four to seven years. However, economic and market conditions have influenced and may continue to influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time, and, as discussed above, the Special Committee is currently exploring the availability of strategic alternatives for us. 
KBS Capital Advisors periodically performs a hold-sell analysis on each asset in our portfolio in order to determine a reasonable time to sell the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders. Periodic reviews of each asset focus on the remaining available value enhancement opportunities for the asset, the demand for the asset in the marketplace, market conditions and our overall portfolio objectives to determine if the sale of the asset, whether via an individual sale or as part of a portfolio sale or merger, would generate a favorable return to our stockholders.

The following charts illustrate the geographic diversification of our real estate investments based on total leased square feet and total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018: 
_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2018, adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term.
We have a stable tenant base and we have tried to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of real estate properties was 76% occupied. Three tenants leasing space in our portfolio of real estate properties represented more than 10% of our total annualized base rent. See Item 2, “Properties — Concentration of Credit Risks.”

Our top ten tenants leasing space in our portfolio of real estate properties represented approximately 53.5% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018. The chart below illustrates the diversity of tenant industries in our portfolio of real estate properties based on total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018: 
_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2018, adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term.
(2) “Other Professional Services” includes professional services from several industries that are each individually less than 6% of total. 
(3) “Other” includes any industry less than 2% of total.
As of December 31, 2018, our highest tenant industry concentrations (greater than 10% of annualized base rent) of our real estate portfolio were as follows: 

Industry | Number of Tenants | Annualized Base Rent (1)(in thousands) | | Percentage ofAnnualized Base Rent
Finance | 32 | $ | 26,807 | | | 25.3 | %
Legal Services | 32 | 14,711 | | | 13.9 | % 
Mining, Oil & Gas Extraction | 3 | 13,711 | | | 12.9 | % 
Educational Services | 1 | 11,728 | | | 11.1 | % 
 | | $ | 66,957 | | | 63.2 | %

No other tenant industries accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent.
The total cost of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was $1.4 billion.

Financing Objectives
We financed the majority of our real estate investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 3.8%. 
We borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates; as of December 31, 2018, we had $41.9 million and $375.0 million of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rate of our fixed debt was 3.5% and the interest rate of our variable debt was 3.8%. The interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2018, using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2018, where applicable. 
The following is a schedule of maturities, including principal amortization payments, for all of our notes payable outstanding as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): 

2019 | $ | 1,304 
2020 | 415,564 | 
 | $ | 416,868

We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, if applicable, or pay off or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.
We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) of all of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. We did not exceed this limitation on borrowings during any quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 33% of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the management of the daily operations of our real estate investment portfolio; the disposition of real estate investments; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.
Competitive Market Factors
We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. 
We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell, assuming we are able to sell such properties, which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders.
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively.

Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The cost of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired. Some of our properties are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Industry Segments
We invested in core real estate properties and real estate-related investments with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income-producing investments. Our real estate properties exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics to each other. As of December 31, 2018, we aggregated our investments in real estate properties into one reportable business segment.
Employees
We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us. 
Principal Executive Office
Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Newport Center Drive, Suite 700, Newport Beach, CA 92660. Our telephone number, general facsimile number and website address are (949) 417-6500, (949) 417-6501 and www.kbsreitii.com, respectively.
