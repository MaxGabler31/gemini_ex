Item 1.    Business
AZZ Inc. (“AZZ”, the “Company”, “our” or “we”) was established in 1956 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. We are a global provider of galvanizing services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services to the power generation, transmission, distribution, refining and industrial markets. We have two distinct operating segments: the Energy Segment and Galvanizing Segment. AZZ Galvanizing is a leading provider of metal finishing solutions for corrosion protection, including hot dip galvanizing to the North American steel fabrication industry. AZZ Energy is dedicated to delivering safe and reliable transmission of power from generation sources to end customers, and automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation to critical infrastructure in the energy markets worldwide.
Energy Segment
AZZ's Energy Segment is a leading provider of specialized products and services designed to support industrial, nuclear and electrical applications. Our product offerings include custom switchgear, electrical enclosures, medium and high voltage bus ducts, explosion proof and hazardous duty lighting, nuclear safety-related equipment and tubular products. In addition to our product offerings, AZZ's Energy Segment focuses on extension of life cycle for the power generation, refining and industrial infrastructure, through automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation. The markets for our Energy Segment are highly competitive and consist of large multi-national companies, along with numerous small independent companies. Competition is based primarily on product quality, range of product line, price and service. While some of our competitors are much larger than us, our Energy Segment offers some of the most technologically advanced solutions and engineering resources developed from a legacy of proven, reliable product options, allowing AZZ Energy to be ideally positioned to meet the most challenging application-specific demands.
Copper, aluminum, steel and nickel based alloys are the primary raw materials used by this segment. We do not foresee any availability issues for these materials. We do not contractually commit to minimum volumes and increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to the customer’s contracts, which the customers may not accept. In addition, we seek to get firm pricing contracts from our vendors on these materials at the time we receive orders from our customers in order to minimize risk. 
We sell Energy Segment products through manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, agents and our internal sales force. We are not dependent on any single customer for this segment, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or net income.

On March 1, 2016, we completed an acquisition of the equity securities of Power Electronics, Inc. (“PEI”), a Millington, Maryland-based manufacturer and integrator of electrical enclosure systems. The acquisition of PEI will enhance our capacity to serve existing and new customers in a diverse set of industries along the Eastern seaboard of the United States.
For additional information regarding the Energy Segment's backlog and operating results, see Results of Operations within Item 7. For additional financial information by segment, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Galvanizing Segment
The Galvanizing Segment provides hot dip galvanizing to the steel fabrication industry through facilities located throughout the United States and Canada. Hot dip galvanizing is a metallurgical process in which molten zinc is applied to steel. The zinc alloying renders corrosion protection to fabricated steel for extended periods of up to 50 years. As of February 28, 2017, we operated forty-one galvanizing plants, which are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia in the United States and Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, Canada.
Galvanizing is a highly competitive business, and we compete with other galvanizing companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers, and alternate forms of corrosion protection such as material selection (stainless steel or aluminum) or barrier protections such as powder coating, paint, and weathering steel. Our galvanizing markets are generally limited to areas within relatively close proximity to our galvanizing plants due to freight cost.
Zinc, the principal raw material used in the galvanizing process, is currently readily available, but is subject to volatile pricing. We manage our exposure to commodity pricing of zinc by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers that include fixed costs contracts to guard against escalating commodity prices. We also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. We may or may not continue to use these or other strategies to manage risk in the future.
We typically serve fabricators or manufacturers that provide services to the electrical and telecommunications, bridge and highway, petrochemical and general industrial markets, and numerous original equipment manufacturers. We do not depend on any single customer for a significant amount of our sales, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or net income.
On February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Alpha Galvanizing Inc. (“Alpha Galvanizing”), an Atkinson, Nebraska-based business unit of Olson Industries, Inc. Alpha Galvanizing has served steel fabrication customers that manufacture electrical utility poles, agricultural machinery and industrial manufacturing components since 1996. Alpha Galvanizing was acquired to expand the footprint of AZZ Galvanizing and to support AZZ’s locations in Minnesota and Denver, Colorado, as well as serve customers in the upper Midwest region.
On June 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of US Galvanizing, LLC, a provider of steel corrosion coating services and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trinity Industries, Inc. (“US Galvanizing”). The acquisition of the US Galvanizing assets included six galvanizing facilities located in Hurst, Texas; Kennedale, Texas; Big Spring, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Morgan City, Louisiana; and Kosciusko, Mississippi. Additionally, the transaction included Texas Welded Wire, a secondary business integrated within US Galvanizing's Hurst, Texas facility. US Galvanizing was acquired to expand AZZ Galvanizing’s Southern operations.
On June 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Zalk Steel & Supply Co. (“Zalk Steel”), a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based galvanizing company. Zalk Steel was acquired to expand AZZ Galvanizing's existing geographic footprint in the upper Midwest region of the United States.
