OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
 
The Company was formed in the state of Nevada on August 26, 2010 under the name "Zippy Bags, Inc." to provide retail sales of snowboard carrying bags to the general public.
 
After the takeover by new management on June 17, 2014, the Company, through its 100% indirectly owned subsidiary, Wonderful Gate Strategy Company Limited, became principally engaged in the service of introducing sub-junkets and information technology infrastructure to land-based casinos. For sub-junkets introduction service and IT infrastructure introduction service performed, we charge 0.2% and 0.05%, respectively, of total bets played by players introduced by sub-junkets from the three casinos located in Cambodia.
 
On October 30, 2014, the Company filed a certificate of amendment (the "Amendment") to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to "Glorywin Entertainment Group, Inc." in order to better reflect the direction and business of the Company. The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of March 31.
 
We have established a website (www.glorywinentertainment.com) which set forth general information for the Company.
 
Based on our current operating plan, we expect that we will be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses for the next twelve months. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital.

Player acquisition is a key factor for organic growth in the online gaming industry. Players are primarily acquired from affiliates for a fixed fee or percentage of earnings based on negotiated predetermined criteria. Affiliates are websites or individuals that attract players through various means such as player news/interest websites, email campaigns or other relationships. The key is that payment to affiliates takes place only when negotiated criteria are met. The criteria may be player minimum deposit, level of play, or revenue earned. The critical element is that unlike most marketing campaigns, the revenues returned by marketing are generally predictable.
 
The key elements of player retention are the creation of exciting opportunities to maintain player interest and increase play frequency. Similar to land-based casino's compensation programs, the tools used for this purpose include prizes, "free money," opportunities to play against famous (or infamous) players, and tournament qualifications.
 
On January 19, 2015, the Company entered into a conditional agreement with the Company's major shareholder, Taipan Pearl Sdn Bhd to acquire 100% interest in GWIN Company Limited ("GWIN"), operating Chetaeu De Bavet Club Co ("Chetaeu") a land based casino in Kingdom of Cambodia. Under the terms of the conditional purchase agreement, the Company is entitle to 100% interest of the company. In consideration for the purchase, GWIN made a Refundable Deposit of USD2,000,000 ("Deposit") and will take full operation of the land-based casino for a total of 12 months. Upon the operations achieving at least positive revenue within that 12 months period, the transaction is considered completed with Deposit being the Consideration Purchase Price.
 
On February 18, 2015, the Company entered into a binding sub agreement worth $2 million with GWIN. Pursuant to the binding sub agreement, the Company would finance the construction amount and Banker's Capital for operations of GWIN. GWIN has extensive experience in promoting gaming business in Asia, as well as implementing fraud and Risk Control, payment processing and compliance with particular respect to gaming. It is envisaged that the parties will work together in a joint venture to raise capital and contribute expertise with the intention of generating revenues, profits and returning value to shareholders.
 
The Company is currently finalizing due diligence on this transaction and incorporated as part of the due diligence will be an assurance that GWIN does not facilitate gaming in any illegal jurisdictions and are fully compliant  with all laws pertaining to their current operation.
 
Support and Services
 
Online support is provided to the Company and sub-junkets by Casino's contracted independent IT company in Vietnam. The IT Company functions also as an independent third party, to confirm on month end sales and commission for each individual party.
Competition
 
The market for the Company's businesses has relatively low competition in the region of Southeast Asia, being in contract with licensed and regulated land-based casinos. Internationally, primary competition would be expected from offshore gaming companies. With few exceptions, significant listed game companies (many of which are listed on the stock exchanges) operate using their own software. We believe that we retain the ability to utilize the most profitable platform available and are not restricted to a single platform.
