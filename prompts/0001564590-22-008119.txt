Our Mission and Brands 
 Our mission is simple—to improve life’s journey for the wellbeing of humankind, and the earth on which we live. This is no empty promise. It’s the mantra that we live by every day. For in the end, we are what we do. It takes a village to build a great company, but no matter how big we get, the human touch is evident in everything we do and that will never change.
 We are building a family of brands that encompass that mission. While each company has its own products and approach, we are united by our shared core values: integrity, fairness, quality, inclusion, sustainability and hard work along with an unwavering desire to do what’s right.
 Village Farms Fresh, our produce brand, has pioneered Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) in North America and helped feed a hungry planet with sustainable greenhouse growing for over three decades. We produce and distribute fresh, premium-quality produce with consistency 365 days a year from more than eight million square feet of CEA greenhouses in British Columbia (“B.C.”) and Texas, as well as from our partner greenhouses in B.C., Ontario, and Mexico.
 Our Canadian cannabis brand includes Pure Sunfarms Corp. (“Pure Sunfarms” or “PSF”) and Rose LifeScience Inc. (“Rose LifeScience or Rose”). Pure Sunfarms is one of the single largest and most respected cannabis growers in the world and one of the best-selling flower brands in Canada. Rose is a leading vertically integrated, branded cannabis producer, supplier and commercialization expert in the Province of Quebec.
 Balanced Health Botanicals, LLC (“Balanced Health” or “BHB”) comprises our U.S. cannabis brand. Balanced Health owns and operates one of the leading brands in the hemp-derived cannabidiol (“CBD”) and other cannabinoids market, produces high quality health and wellness products and distributes primarily through its top-ranked e-commerce platform, CBDistilleryTM. 
 Village Farms Clean Energy (“VFCE”), our clean energy brand, currently converts landfill gas into clean energy sources, creating heat and electricity for our Vancouver greenhouses while also selling electricity to British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (“BC Hydro”). VFCE is in the process of transitioning this operation to a renewable natural gas facility (“Delta RNG Project”) in conjunction with Mas Energy, LLC (“Mas Energy”) which is expected to provide food-grade CO2 to our greenhouse growing operations in Delta, British Columbia (“B.C.”).
 Our Commitment and Values 
 Our core operation principle is to deliver fairness and satisfaction in its customer promise.  We strive to operate the business for optimal success by endeavoring to be:
 - a responsible producer of high-quality products 
 - a reliable, trusted partner to customers 
 - a provider of excellence in customer service and logistics 
 - a business with a solid balance sheet 
 - enhancing shareholder value through continual execution and growth 
 - a trusted steward of the environment 
 - a workplace where all employees can grow and prosper 
 - an employer for people who want to make a difference in the world. 
 For over thirty years, we have pioneered Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) in North America and helped feed an increasing population with sustainable, greenhouse growing.  In 2017, we expanded our focus from produce, leveraging our considerable knowledge, to the flourishing cannabis and health and wellness markets. We envisioned and created Pure Sunfarms and Village Fields Hemp USA, LLC (“VF Hemp or VFH”) to artfully blend traditional greenhouse expertise with hands-on knowledge of legacy growing practices in cannabis and hemp. We are always innovating and never standing still. We only invest in and partner with companies that share our values and respect for people and the environment. In 2021, we acquired 100% of Balanced Health and 70% of Rose LifeScience; we increased our investment in Altum International Pty Ltd; and we entered into an option agreement with Leli Holland B.V. in order to expand our market offerings, provide additional avenues to distribute our products and expand our global footprint.

We are extremely proud of many things that we achieved over the past three-plus decades, but none more than our highly responsible approach to the environment. Between our sustainably sourced ingredients and growing methods, to our use of clean energy and other innovative technologies, we are proud to bring sustenance and wellbeing to our consumers in a way that is ethical and responsible to the planet.
 Our cutting-edge greenhouses use less water, land, and chemicals than traditional outdoor farming, and we aim to introduce new technologies to be greener in the future. The earth’s finite water supply is one of its most precious resources and Village Farms’ hydroponic growing sterilizes and recirculates the same water four times and 100% of the water reaches the plants. Utilizing our state-of-the-art CEA facilities, our proficient growing methods deliver vastly more yield per acre compared to outdoor growing, without depleting the soil. We use beneficial insects to control pests and promote healthy plant growth and administer organic pesticides, so our GMO-free crops grow in a nourishing environment free of harmful chemicals. In our cannabis greenhouses, we collect, filter and utilize rainwater for our plants, use renewable hydroelectricity as the main power source, provide innovative energy screens to help capture the sun’s warmth and prevent heat loss, and employ blackout curtains to reduce light pollution, all in an effort to minimize our impact to the local community and ecosystem.
 Business Overview
 Village Farms International, Inc. (“VFF”), (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Village Farms”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) converted from an income trust to a publicly-traded company on December 31, 2009 and in connection with the conversion, the Company changed its name to Village Farms International, Inc. The Company’s subsidiaries operated vegetable producing greenhouses since 1989 and began production in Texas in 1996. On October 18, 2006, the merger between Village Farms and Hot House Growers resulted in one of the largest producers, marketers and distributors of greenhouse grown products in North America. VFF pioneered Controlled Environment Agriculture in North America, and over the years we transformed the organization, adapting to meet industry changes and customer preferences, in order to persevere and remain one of the largest and longest-operating vertically integrated greenhouse growers in North America. 
 We produce and distribute fresh, premium-quality produce with consistency 365 days a year from more than eight million square feet of CEA greenhouses in B.C. and Texas, as well as from our partner greenhouses in B.C., Ontario, and Mexico. The Company primarily markets and distributes under its Village Farms® brand name and proprietary produce trademarks to retail supermarkets and dedicated fresh food distribution companies throughout the United States and Canada. 
 In our Canadian cannabis operations, we wholly own British Columbia-based Pure Sunfarms. Pure Sunfarms is one of the single largest cannabis growing operations in the world, one of the lowest-cost greenhouse producers and one of the best-selling flower brands in Canada. Pure Sunfarms leverages our 30 years of experience as a vertically integrated greenhouse grower for the rapidly developing cannabis opportunity in Canada with commercial distribution in six Canadian provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec and Saskatchewan. Our long-term objective for Pure Sunfarms is to be the leading low-cost, high-quality cannabis producer in Canada. 
 On November 15, 2021, Village Farms acquired 70% ownership of privately-held, Quebec-based Rose LifeScience, as described in additional detail in “Recent Developments and Updates” below. Rose is a leading vertically integrated, branded cannabis producer, supplier and commercialization expert in the Province of Quebec and has become the Quebec operational unit of Village Farms’ Canadian cannabis segment.
 On August 16, 2021, the Company acquired 100% interest in privately held Colorado-based Balanced Health, which now comprises the operational segment of our U.S. cannabis segment. Balanced Health owns and operates one of the leading brands in the hemp-derived CBD and other cannabinoid market in the United States, providing Village Farms with immediate entry into the U.S. CBD market in a consumer products category adjacent to the high-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) cannabis market, as well as the broader consumer packaged goods wellness arena. BHB has established a diverse portfolio of CBD and other cannabinoid products, including ingestible, edible and topical applications that are distributed through brick-and-mortar retail channels as well as its top-ranked e-commerce platform, CBDistilleryTM (www.theCBDistillery.com).
 The Company entered the U.S. hemp business in the spring of 2019 after the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill. We established a joint venture with a 65% interest in VF Hemp for multi-state outdoor hemp cultivation and cannabidiol extraction, also within Village Farms’ U.S. cannabis segment. Currently, VF Hemp is not cultivating hemp as we await Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clarity on the use of CBD.
 The Company, through its subsidiary VFCE, owns and operates a power plant from landfill gas that generates electricity and provides thermal heat to one of the Company’s adjacent B.C. greenhouse facilities and sells electricity to BC Hydro. On November 10, 2020, we announced that we will be transitioning this operation to a renewable natural gas facility in conjunction with Mas Energy which we expect will enhance our financial return as well as provide food-grade CO2, which can be used in both our cannabis and produce growing operations in Delta, B.C. 
 Internationally, we evaluate, and target select, nascent, legal cannabis opportunities with significant long-term potential. This has resulted in a minority investment in Australia-based Altum International Pty Ltd (“Altum”), and Village Farms also entered into an option agreement on September 28, 2021 to receive the irrevocable right to acquire ownership interest in Netherlands-based Leli Holland B.V.

Our Canadian Cannabis Segment
 Village Farms’ Canadian cannabis segment includes Pure Sunfarms and Rose LifeScience.
 Pure Sunfarms 
 In June 2017, the Company formed a Canadian joint venture, Pure Sunfarms, with Emerald Health Therapeutics, Inc. (“Emerald”) to commence Canadian cannabis operations in anticipation of the adult use cannabis market becoming legal in October 2017. The Company contributed one of its Delta, B.C. greenhouses (“Delta 3”) to the joint venture in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture. Emerald contributed C$20 million, which was paid in installments, in exchange for the other 50% ownership interest in the joint venture. Village Farms also contributed its experienced grower management and Delta 3 workforce to the joint venture and Emerald contributed its existing cultivation license and cannabis expertise. 
 On November 2, 2020, the Company acquired 36,958,500 Common Shares in the capital of Pure Sunfarms owned by Emerald, which increased the Company’s ownership of Pure Sunfarms to 100%. The shares, representing 42.6% of the ownership at the time, were acquired for a total purchase price of C$79.9 million (US$60.0 million), satisfied through a C$60.0 million (US$45.0 million) cash payment and a C$19.9 million (US$15.0 million) secured promissory note payable to Emerald due on May 2, 2021. The promissory note was paid in full to Emerald on February 8, 2021.
 Business of Pure Sunfarms
During the course of 2017, the joint venture between Village Farms and Emerald applied for a cultivation license for the Delta 3 facility. In March 2018, the joint venture received its initial cultivation license for a portion of the Delta 3 facility and expanded its cultivation space via amendments to its cultivation license throughout 2018, culminating with the complete cultivation license for the entire 25-acre facility (1.1 million square feet) in March 2019. During 2018, the joint venture also hired a chief executive officer and adopted a name for the joint venture, Pure Sunfarms Corp. Pure Sunfarms commenced cultivation in the spring of 2018, after receiving its initial cultivation license.
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act came into effect, regulating both the medical and recreational cannabis markets in Canada and providing provincial, territorial, and municipal governments the authority to regulate the distribution and sale of recreational cannabis. For the first nine months of 2019, Pure Sunfarms was a wholesale supplier to other licensed producers. In September 2019, Pure Sunfarms received its provincial sales license and commenced sales to the Ontario Cannabis Store (“OCS”) and British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch (“BCLDB”). In October 2019, Health Canada approved the second phase of recreational cannabis products including ingestible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals, referred to as Cannabis 2.0 products. 
 During 2020, Pure Sunfarms commenced sales to three additional provinces, Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority (“SLGA”), Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (“AGLC”) and Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries Corporation (“MLLC”), allowing availability of Pure Sunfarms’ products to five of Canada’s provinces. Pure Sunfarms continues to advance discussions with other provincial distributors for supply agreements to further expand its presence in the Canadian cannabis market. In May 2020, Pure Sunfarms received its cannabis cultivation license from Health Canada for the Delta 2 facility, providing an additional 1.1 million square feet of production capacity, enhancing its ability to grow, package and sell cannabis and cannabis extracts. Pure Sunfarms also received amended licensing from Health Canada in the fall of 2020, permitting in-house extraction operations and the sale of cannabis derivative products directly to provincial boards and authorized retailers. On June 30, 2021, Health Canada amended the Delta 2 facility license received in May 2020, permitting Pure Sunfarms to cultivate cannabis in the completed west half of the facility. In the west half of the facility, Pure Sunfarms has planted seven flower rooms and began harvesting in November 2021. Management is currently evaluating the timing of the expansion and completion of the east half of the facility in concert with supply and market demands.
 Pure Sunfarms has continued expansion of its direct to provincial sales in 2021 and 2020 and is now the top selling flower brand in Ontario based on weekly point of sales data. In addition, Pure Sunfarms launched new dried cannabis products such as pre-rolled flower and commenced sales of cannabis derivative products, including pre-filled vape cartridges, edibles and bottled cannabis oils. Pure Sunfarms’ sales were approximately 74% in branded sales and 26% in non-branded sales in 2021, as compared to 54% of revenue from branded flower and pre-roll sales, with an additional 5% from branded cannabis oil and vape pens, which Pure Sunfarms launched in September 2020, and 41% of revenue from non-branded sales in 2020. We believe that Pure Sunfarms is the leading low-cost high-quality producer in the Canadian market and its low-cost structure, primarily driven by economies of scale and large-scale greenhouse experience, is sustainable and provides a competitive industry advantage. Pure Sunfarms’ cost structure should allow a continued increase of incremental market share as we go to market at a lower price for most of our products than other licensed producers can maintain. 
 Village Farms acquired Rose LifeScience in November 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Pure Sunfarms, via our relationship with Rose LifeScience, began generating sales in Quebec. Pure Sunfarms and Rose are developing a business strategy that leverages the strengths of both companies, while providing a means to distribute Pure Sunfarms’ products to Quebec’s consumers.

Due to the Health Canada limitations on marketing, branding, and packaging rules, it is difficult to distinguish our products which places more emphasis on our ability to manage the price, potency and quality. Pure Sunfarms’ British Columbia grown flower and extracts continue to distinguish themselves from the competition due to the agricultural expertise of our growers and brand management, which we believe ensures the highest quality cannabis at the right price.
 The retail channel remains very competitive and continues to experience an oversupply situation as the licensed growers are producing more cannabis than the current legal recreational market is purchasing. This situation is a function of too many federally licensed cannabis producers (“License Holder” or “LPs”). In response, many LPs have either curtailed or halted their cannabis production to right size the supply to consumer demand. We anticipate continued industry consolidation and attrition as LPs face margin compression, high operating costs and seek potential synergistic benefits from consolidation with an aim to generate positive earnings and cash flows from operations. Furthermore, the cannabis industry is not immune to COVID-19 impacts which has adversely affected key markets in Canada, particularly in Ontario, as the provincial government has imposed access restrictions at points throughout the pandemic. As the industry matures, we believe that Pure Sunfarms will be well-positioned as one of the best-selling brands in Canada, while we continue to evaluate and seek to secure partnerships to realize future opportunities to expand our sales, products and footprint in Canada and internationally. 
 Rose LifeScience
                 Village Farms acquired 70% ownership of privately-held Rose on November 15, 2021. Rose is the Quebec operational unit of Village Farms’ Canadian cannabis business segment, with its headquarters in Huntingdon, Quebec. Rose is a leading third-party cannabis products commercialization expert in the Province of Quebec, acting as the exclusive, direct-to-retail sales, marketing and distribution entity for some of the best-known brands in Canada as well as Quebec-based micro and craft growers. With decades of regulated-market experience, Rose partners with cannabis companies to assist in commercializing their products, distributing the products throughout Quebec and ensuring a strong presence in the marketplace. Rose champions Quebec producers by working directly with micro-producers to advance homegrown, craft products in the province and easing the burden of commercial complexities facing smaller, local businesses. Rose also works with CAREY 3PL, their preferred carrier, to provide full-scale direct-to-store logistics and distribution services to meet the ever-changing needs of their customers.
 Rose cultivates and processes cannabis at their Huntingdon-based 55,000 square-foot CEA facility. The indoor controlled growing facility was commissioned in 2020 and is licensed for use by Health Canada. Rose has been granted environmental rebates from the government of Quebec for its energy efficient design. The CEA is outfitted with special filtration on the facility exhausts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lessen odors and minimize the impact on the local community. In addition, Rose has a team of experienced cannabis growers developing innovative products and distinctive strains. 
 Rose LifeScience adds a highly experienced, successful, Quebec-based leadership team that is now reinforced by the industry knowledge, financial backing and human capital of Village Farms and Pure Sunfarms to grow and expand its footprint throughout Quebec as well as other provinces.
 Canadian Cannabis Industry Overview
 Legal History of Medical Cannabis in Canada
 Prior to October 17, 2018, the production, distribution, and use of cannabis for medical use was and has been legal in Canada since 2001, first under the federal Medical Marihuana Access Regulations, which established a legal regime for the licensing of cannabis producers and the sale of dried cannabis to registered patients pursuant to a medical document provided by a health care practitioner. The Medical Marihuana Access Regulations were later replaced with the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (“MMPR”), and then the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) as a result of a decision by the Federal Court of Canada (the “Federal Court”) in Allard v. Canada. The Federal Court held that requiring individuals to obtain cannabis only from federally licensed cannabis producers violated liberty and security rights protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Federal Court found that individuals who require cannabis for medical purposes did not have “reasonable access” under the MMPR regime. Accordingly, the ACMPR contemplated both access to medical cannabis through a License Holder or through personal production exemptions, thereby giving patients reasonable access to, and choice of, cannabis product. The ACMPR provided three possible alternatives for individuals to access cannabis for medical purposes: (i) they can continue to access quality-controlled cannabis by registering with federal License Holders; (ii) they can register with Health Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes (starting materials must be obtained from a License Holder); or (iii) they can designate someone else who is registered with Health Canada to produce cannabis on their behalf (starting materials must be obtained from a License Holder). 
Current Applicable Regulatory Regime
 On October 17, 2018, the federal Cannabis Act and accompanying Regulations, including the Cannabis Regulations, the new Industrial Hemp Regulations (“IHR”) (together with the Cannabis Regulations, collectively, the “Regulations”), came into force, legalizing the production, distribution, and sale of cannabis for adult non-medicinal (i.e. recreational) purposes, as well as incorporating the existing medical cannabis regulatory scheme under one complete framework.

On October 17, 2019, the Cannabis Regulations were amended to expand the legally permitted categories of cannabis products and support the production and sale of edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals. The amendments, among other things, outline the rules relating to packaging, labelling, and advertising, shelf-stability, cannabinoid concentration levels, restrictions on ingredients, and production and sanitation standards for edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topical products. December 16, 2019 was the earliest date that the new classes of cannabis products could be available for sale. Edible cannabis, as well as extracts and topicals, are all now available for sale in the legalized recreational market in Canada.
 Pursuant to the federal regulatory framework in Canada, each province and territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessories within the province or territory. All Canadian provinces and territories have implemented mechanisms for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes within those jurisdictions, and retail models vary between jurisdictions.
 The Cannabis Act maintains separate access to cannabis for medical purposes, including providing that import and export licenses and permits will only be issued in respect of cannabis for medical or scientific purposes or in respect of industrial hemp. Part 14 of the Cannabis Regulations sets out the regime for medical cannabis following legalization, which is substantively the same as the ACMPR with adjustments to create consistency with rules for non-medical use, improve patient access, and reduce the risk of abuse within the medical access system. Patients who have the authorization of their healthcare provider continue to have access to cannabis, either purchased directly from a federal License Holder authorized to sell for medical purposes, or by registering to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or designating someone to produce cannabis for them.
 Adult Use Cannabis
 The Company participates in the Canadian adult use market for cannabis in compliance with all applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations concerning the Canadian adult use cannabis market. The Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations provide a licensing scheme for the production, importation, exportation, testing, packaging, labelling, sending, delivery, transportation, sale, possession, and disposal of cannabis for non-medicinal use (i.e., adult recreational use). Transitional provisions of the Cannabis Act provide that every license issued under the ACMPR that is in force immediately before the day on which the Cannabis Act comes into force is deemed to be a license issued under the Cannabis Act, and that such license will continue in force until it is revoked or expires.
 Below are additional highlights of the Cannabis Act:
  
• | Places restrictions on the amount of cannabis that individuals can possess and distribute, and on public consumption and use, and prohibits the sale of cannabis unless authorized by the Cannabis Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Permits individuals who are 18 years of age or older to cultivate, propagate, and harvest up to and including four cannabis plants in their dwelling-house, propagated from a seed or plant material authorized by the Cannabis Act.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restricts (but does not strictly prohibit) the promotion and display of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabinoids to consumers, including restrictions on branding and a prohibition on false or misleading promotion and on sponsorships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Permits the informational promotion of cannabis by entities licensed to produce, sell, or distribute cannabis in specified circumstances to individuals 18 years and older.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Introduces packaging and labelling requirements for cannabis and cannabis accessories and prohibits the sale of cannabis or cannabis accessories that could be appealing to young persons.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides the designated minister with the power to recall any cannabis or class of cannabis on reasonable grounds that such a recall is necessary to protect public health or public safety.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishes a national cannabis tracking system to monitor the movement of cannabis from where it is grown, to where it is processed, to where it is sold.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides powers to inspectors for the purpose of administering and enforcing the Cannabis Act and a system for administrative monetary penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Licenses, Permits and Authorizations
 The Cannabis Regulations establish the following classes of licenses:
  
• | license for cultivation;
--+-------------------------


• | license for processing;
--+------------------------


• | license for analytical testing;
--+--------------------------------


• | license for sale;
--+------------------


• | license for research; and
--+--------------------------


• | a cannabis drug license.
--+-------------------------

 The Cannabis Regulations also create subclasses for cultivation licenses (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing licenses (standard processing and micro-processing). Different licenses and each sub-class therein, carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each license category and each 
 5


sub-class. Licenses that were issued under the ACMPR are deemed to be licenses issued under the Cannabis Act. Licenses issued under the Cannabis Act have associated expiry dates and are subject to renewal requirements.
 Security Clearances
 Certain individuals associated with cannabis licensees, including individuals occupying “key positions”, directors, officers, individuals who exercise, or are in a position to exercise, direct control over the corporate licensee, and other individuals identified by the Minister of Health (the “Minister”), must hold a valid security clearance issued by the Minister. Under the Cannabis Regulations, the Minister may refuse to grant security clearances to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption, or violent offences. This was largely the approach in place under the ACMPR and other related regulations governing the licensed production of cannabis for medical purposes. Individuals having a history of nonviolent, lower-risk criminal activity (for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants) are not precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry, however, grant of security clearance to such individuals is at the discretion of the Minister and such applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Cannabis Tracking System
 Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister is authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system. The purpose of this system is to track cannabis throughout the supply chain, to help prevent cannabis from being diverted to an illicit market or activity and to help prevent illicit cannabis from being a source of supply of cannabis in the legal market. Pursuant to the Ministry of Health’s Cannabis Tracking System Order (the “Order”), a holder of a federal license for cultivation, a license for processing or a license for sale for medical purposes that authorizes the possession of cannabis must report monthly to the Minister with specific information about their authorized activities with cannabis (e.g. cannabis inventory quantities), in the form and manner specified by the Minister. The Order also provides for monthly reporting by provincial bodies and provincially authorized private retailers of certain information in the form and manner specified by the Minister.
Cannabis Products
 The Cannabis Regulations set out the requirements for cannabis products that are permitted for sale at the retail level, including the limit on THC content, permitted ingredients, limit on pest control product residues, as well as microbial and chemical contaminants. As of October 17, 2019, the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations permit the sale of the following classes of products: dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, cannabis plant seeds, as well as cannabis edibles, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals.
Packaging and Labeling
 The Cannabis Regulations set out strict requirements pertaining to the packaging and labelling of cannabis products. These requirements are intended to promote informed consumer choice and safe consumption and allow for the safe handling and transportation of cannabis, while also reducing the appeal of cannabis to youth.
 The Cannabis Regulations require all cannabis products to be packaged in a manner that is tamper-proof and child resistant. Strict limitations are also imposed on the use of colors, graphics, and other special characteristics of packaging. For example, all-over package coverings must be clear, and the interior surface and exterior surface of any container in which a cannabis product is packaged must be one uniform color. Cannabis package labels must include specific information, such as (i) product source information, including brand name, the class of cannabis and the name, phone number and email of the licensed processor or cultivator, (ii) mandatory warnings, including rotating health warning messages on Health Canada’s list of standard health warnings; (iii) the Health Canada standardized cannabis symbol; and (iv) information specifying THC and CBD content.
 A cannabis product’s brand name may only be displayed once on the principal display panel or, if there are separate principal display panels for English and French, only once on each principal display panel. It can be in any font style and any size, so long as it is equal to or smaller than the health warning message. The font must not be in metallic or fluorescent color. In addition to the brand name, only one other brand element can be displayed. Such brand element must meet the same requirements noted above as the brand name, and if an image, it must be in a size equal to or smaller than the surface area of the standardized cannabis symbol.
 Health Products Containing Cannabis
 Health Canada is taking a scientific, evidenced-based approach for the oversight of health products with cannabis that may be approved with health claims, including prescription and non-prescription drugs, veterinary drugs, and medical devices. Under the current regulatory framework, health products are subject to the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and its regulations and may be additionally regulated by the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. For many of these products, pre-market approval from Health Canada is required.

Possible Changes to the Federal Regulatory Framework
 On December 12, 2020, Health Canada issued a notice of intent, consulting stakeholders on the expansion of non-medicinal cannabis research involving human participants. Health Canada proposed to amend the Cannabis Act, the Cannabis Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations so that non-medicinal cannabis research involving human participants is regulated exclusively under the cannabis legislation. Further, Health Canada also sought feedback on a host of other regulatory issues, including public possession, product labeling, micro-class and nursery licensing, and COVID-19 measures.
 The consultation closed on January 11, 2021. Pending results of the consultation, it is possible that Health Canada may introduce legislative updates in the future.
 Provincial and Territorial Regulatory Framework for Recreational Cannabis
 While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation of the commercial production of cannabis and related matters by the federal government, the Cannabis Act provides the provinces and territories of Canada with authority to adopt their own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessory products within the province or territory, permitting for example, provincial and territorial governments to set lower possession limits for individuals and higher age requirements. Currently, each of the Canadian provincial and territorial jurisdictions has established the minimum age for cannabis use to be 19 years old, except for Québec and Alberta, where the minimum age is 21 and 18, respectively.
 The provinces and territories are responsible for the establishment of a retail distribution system for adult use cannabis in their respective jurisdictions. All Canadian provinces and territories have implemented mechanisms for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes within those jurisdictions, and retail models vary between jurisdictions. Provincial/territorial bodies act as intermediaries between entities licensed federally under the Cannabis Act and consumers, such bodies acting in some jurisdictions as exclusive cannabis wholesalers and distributors, and in some instances such bodies acting as exclusive retailers. The laws continue to evolve, and differences in provincial and territorial regulatory frameworks could result in, among other things, increased compliance costs, and increased supply costs.
 Municipal and regional governments may choose to impose additional requirements and regulations on the sale of recreational cannabis, adding further uncertainty and risk to the company’s business. Municipal by-laws may restrict the number of recreational cannabis retail outlets that are permitted in a certain geographical area or restrict the geographical locations wherein such retail outlets may be opened.
 There is no assurance that the provincial, territorial, regional, and municipal regulatory frameworks and distribution models will remain unchanged, or that the Company will be able to navigate such changes in the regulatory frameworks and distribution models or conduct its intended business thereunder. See: “Risk Factors”.
 Ontario: Pursuant to the Cannabis Control Act, 2017 (Ontario), the distribution and retail sale of recreational cannabis is currently conducted through the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (“OCRC”), a subsidiary of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Recreational cannabis has been sold on-line through the OCRC-operated Ontario Cannabis Store (“OCS”) platform, as of October 17, 2018.
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis License Act, 2018 (Ontario) became law and other legislation, including the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation Act, 2017 and the Liquor Control Act were amended to create a private retail framework for the sale of recreational cannabis in Ontario. As of April 1, 2019, recreational cannabis has been available for sale by private retailers that operate brick-and-mortar stores licensed by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (“AGCO”).
 The recreational cannabis retail regulatory regime in Ontario has the following requirements and features:
  
• | Private retailers are required to obtain both a retail operator license and a retail store authorization. Retail store authorizations are only to be issued to persons holding a retail operator license. Separate retail store authorizations are to be required for each cannabis retail store, but a licensed retail operator may hold more than one retail store authorization and operate multiple stores. Private retailers are not permitted to sell cannabis online but may only sell cannabis in person at an authorized retail store.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The AGCO is the government entity responsible for issuing retail store authorizations for privately run recreational cannabis stores. Until December 13, 2019, a temporary cap of 25 retail store authorizations was imposed while cannabis supply stabilizes. On July 3, 2019, the Government of Ontario announced its plans for a second allocation of 50 additional cannabis retail store authorizations. The AGCO held a lottery draw for the allocation of 42 retail store authorizations. A separate process governed the allocation of eight retail store authorizations for those who wish to operate a store on a First Nations reserve. On March 2, 2020, the restrictions on the total number of store authorizations permitted in Ontario, and their regional distribution, was revoked. The AGCO now accepts applications for retail store authorizations from all interested applicants.

• | Federal License Holders (and their affiliates) are limited to operating one retail cannabis store in the province, which must be located at the site listed on such producer’s federal license. A broad definition of affiliate is included in the regulations. An affiliate relationship exists if a corporation beneficially owns or controls voting shares, or securities that may be converted to voting shares, constituting more than 25% of voting rights. If a person, or group acting together, holds 50% voting control for the election of directors or market share of the corporation, they are considered affiliates. Additionally, an affiliate relationship may be established through involvement in a trust, partnership, or joint venture, among others. The definition of affiliate may have the effect of restricting the ability of federal License Holders from effectively entering into the consumer retail market in Ontario.

Municipalities had until January 22, 2019 to pass such by-laws, and several municipalities have formally opted-out of the retail market. Municipalities that opted out can later lift the prohibition on retail cannabis stores by subsequent resolution, which cannot be reversed at a later date. Municipalities may not pass bylaws providing for a further system of licensing over the retail sale of cannabis.

 Manitoba: The Government of Manitoba has implemented a ‘‘hybrid model’’ for cannabis distribution, whereby supply is secured and tracked by the Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries Corp. (“MLLC”); however, licensed private retail stores are also permitted to sell recreational cannabis.
 Alberta: The Government of Alberta has implemented a cannabis framework providing for the purchase of cannabis products from private retailers that receive their products from a government-regulated distributor, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (“AGLC”), similar to the distribution system currently in place for alcohol in the province. Only licensed retail outlets are permitted to sell cannabis with online sales run by the AGLC. The Government of Alberta recently passed an amendment to the Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Act that will allow online sales of cannabis by licensed retail outlets once the amendment is proclaimed into force.
 New Brunswick: All recreational cannabis is managed and sold through a network of tightly controlled, stand-alone “Cannabis NB” stores managed by the Cannabis Management Corporation, a subsidiary of New Brunswick Liquor Corporation and is available for sale online through the Cannabis NB platform.
 Quebec: All recreational cannabis is managed and sold by Société québécoise du cannabis (the “SQDC”) outlets and is available for sale online, the entire process controlled by the SQDC.
 Newfoundland and Labrador: Recreational cannabis is sold through private stores, with the crown-owned liquor corporation, the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corp. (the “NLC”), issuing private retailer licenses and overseeing the distribution to private sellers who may sell to consumers. The NLC also controls the possession, sale, and delivery of cannabis, and sets prices. The NLC is also the online retailer, although licenses may later be issued to private interests.
 Yukon: Yukon had initially limited the distribution and sale of recreational cannabis to government outlets and government-run online stores but has since opened up its retail market to permit licensed private retailers in the territory. Cannabis retail licenses are issued by the Cannabis Licensing Board. Authorized retailers must purchase cannabis from the Yukon Liquor Corporation, acting as the wholesaler and distributor in the territory.
 Northwest Territories: The Northwest Territories Liquor and Cannabis Commission (the “NTLCC”) controls the importation and distribution of cannabis, whether through NTLCC-approved retail outlets or online retail run by the NTLCC. Communities in the Northwest Territories are able to hold a plebiscite to prohibit cannabis, similar to the options currently available to restrict alcohol. 
 British Columbia: Recreational cannabis is sold through both public and licensed privately operated stores, with the provincial Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch handling licensing of private stores and the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch (“BCLDB”) handling wholesale distribution.
 Saskatchewan: The Government of Saskatchewan implemented a framework in which both wholesale and retail recreational cannabis are conducted by the private sector and regulated by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority (“SLGA”). A number of retail permits have been issued to private stores. Beginning in April 2020, SLGA began accepting applications for cannabis retail permits in Saskatchewan communities with populations less than 2,500. In September 2020, SLGA began accepting permit applications for stores in all communities in the province. SLGA is currently accepting applications for wholesale cannabis permits as well as federally licensed producer registrations. Permitted wholesalers can sell to permitted retailers and other permitted wholesalers but not to the

general public. Wholesale operations must be physically located within Saskatchewan and product can only be sold and distributed within Saskatchewan. Further, only federally licensed producers registered with SLGA will be allowed to sell into the Saskatchewan market.
 Nova Scotia: The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation is responsible for the regulation of cannabis in the province, and recreational cannabis is only sold publicly through government-operated storefronts and online sales.
 Prince Edward Island: Similar to Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island requires cannabis to be sold publicly, through government stores and online, overseen by the Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation.
 Nunavut: Nunavut allows for the sale of cannabis through both public and private retail and online. In Nunavut, a person can submit an application with the Nunavut Liquor and Cannabis Commission for a license to operate a cannabis store, remote sales store, or cannabis lounge.
 Several of the provinces and territories have been actively working to secure supply agreements from existing federal License Holders. Pure Sunfarms has entered into supply agreements with the OCS, SLGA, BCLDB, AGLC, MLLC and is in discussions with several other provinces with respect to entering supply agreements. On November 15, 2021, Village Farms acquired Rose LifeScience, which is a producer, supplier and commercialization expert in the Province of Quebec.
 Industrial Hemp
 The new Industrial Hemp Regulations under the Cannabis Act replaced the previous IHR under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (“CDSA”) as of October 17, 2018. The regulatory scheme for industrial hemp production largely remains the same, however the IHR permits the sale of hemp plants to licensed cannabis producers, and licensing requirements under the new IHR are softened in accordance with the lower risk posed by industrial hemp. The IHR defines industrial hemp as a cannabis plant, or any part of that plant, in which the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) is 0.3 % or less in the flowering heads and leaves.
Our U.S. Cannabis Segment
 Village Farms’ U.S. cannabis segment includes Balanced Health and VF Hemp.
 Balanced Health
 On August 16, 2021, the Company acquired 100% interest in privately held Colorado-based Balanced Health. Balanced Health is one of the leading CBD and other cannabinoid brands and e-commerce platforms in the United States. BHB develops and sells high-quality cannabinoid-based health and wellness products, distributing their diverse portfolio of consumer products through retail storefronts and its top-ranked e-commerce platform, CBDistilleryTM. Through its strong, long-term partnerships, we believe that Balanced Health is uniquely positioned to ensure seamless sourcing, manufacture and sale of their affordable, high-quality family of cannabinoid brands to target the diverse health and wellness needs and preferences of their consumers. The strong management team of BHB adds a wealth of leadership and industry experience across healthcare, technology, consumer packaged goods and cannabis. 
 Balanced Health is intensely focused on high quality standards and sources non-GMO and pesticide free hemp directly from U.S. Hemp Licensed farms through partnerships and contractual relationships. BHB collaborates with hemp extraction partners using advanced proprietary methods and rigorous testing to ensure product quality and concentration guidelines. In its 8,000 square foot facility, Balanced Health provides on-site bottling, labeling and packaging that follow the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) guidelines. Balanced Health was awarded U.S. Hemp Authority Certification for its commitment to quality and safety of its products and also achieved Generally Recognized as Safe designation, an evaluation its products are recognized as safe for consumption for CBD Isolate (“ISO”), Full-Spectrum CBD (“FSO”) and Broad-Spectrum CBD (“BSO”). In the event that the FDA regulates CBD, and the overall Food, Drug and Mass Merchandise (“FDM”) channel accepts ingestible CBD products, we believe that Balanced Health is uniquely positioned to immediately capitalize on the opportunity.
 Balanced Health’s CBD and other cannabinoid product portfolio primarily includes oils, ingestibles and topicals to meet any consumer’s needs and consumption preferences. The majority of sales are within the United States. Balanced Health has a presence in over 4,000 retail locations across health and wellness, independent pharmacies, convenience stores and lifestyle shops. And, BHB also has an industry-leading Ecommerce platform with an extensive customer base and following. 
 VF Hemp
 The Company entered the U.S. Hemp business in the spring of 2019 after the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill. As Village Farms was not experienced in outdoor field growing, the Company created two U.S. based joint ventures – Village Fields Hemp, Inc., in which it owns 65% and Arkansas Valley Green and Gold Hemp (“AVGGH”), in which it owns 60%, with 5% owned by VFH. The remaining interests in both U.S. hemp joint ventures were partners who had experience in outdoor growing of hemp (VFH) and cannabis (AVGGH). The State of Texas approved the production, manufacture and retail sale of hemp crops and products in June 2019. We wrote off the investment in AVGGH in 2019 due to losing the biomass during a windstorm. Currently, VF Hemp is not cultivating hemp as we await FDA clarity on the use of CBD.

United States Cannabis Industry and Regulatory Overview
 Village Farms does not maintain any direct or indirect investment in cannabis or cannabis-related products in its U.S. operations, excluding Balanced Health’s CBD and other cannabinoid business and the VF Hemp joint venture. The Company targets its efforts on participating in federal and state permissible activities in the U.S. Village Farms does not engage nor intend to engage in direct or indirect business with any business that derives revenue, directly or indirectly, from the sale of cannabis or cannabis-related products in any jurisdiction where the production and sale of cannabis is unlawful under current applicable laws.
 The Company owns and operates four greenhouse facilities in west Texas consisting of nearly six million square feet of produce production area, where we produce and distribute tomatoes. The Company has proven experience converting its produce greenhouses to cannabis greenhouses, as evidenced by its Pure Sunfarms’ Delta 3 and Delta 2 greenhouses located in British Columbia, Canada. Village Farms is strategically positioned, utilizing decades of agricultural experience coupled with its Pure Sunfarms’ operational and product expertise, to convert its existing greenhouses when legally permitted to do so. 
 As of December 31, 2021, thirty-eight states plus Washington, D.C. passed medical marijuana laws and eighteen states plus Washington, D.C. passed recreational laws. Public support for the adult-use legalization of cannabis has increased significantly across the country. Several hundred thousand Americans now work full-time in the cannabis industry and tax revenues associated with the production and sale of cannabis are providing economic benefits in states that have passed legislation. 
 Unlike in Canada, which has uniform federal legislation governing the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, in the United States, cannabis is regulated at both the federal and state levels. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis in some states, cannabis with a delta-9 THC level of more than 0.3% by dry weight (“marijuana”) continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"), making it illegal under federal law in the United States to cultivate. distribute, or possess cannabis. This means that while state law in certain U.S. states may take a permissive approach to medical and/or recreational use of cannabis, the CSA may still be enforced by U.S. federal law enforcement officials against citizens and businesses of those states for activity that is legal under state law. As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the U.S. federal government regarding cannabis, investments in cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation.
 Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (the “Cole Memorandum”). The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a compliance standard for marijuana related businesses. The Cole Memorandum concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis. States where medical cannabis had been legalized were not characterized as a high priority. The Cole Memorandum was rescinded by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January 2018, however, the DOJ guidance on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding marijuana related businesses appears to be relatively unchanged. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law.
 On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law in the United States. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, defines industrial hemp, removes industrial hemp and cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp so long as the delta-9 THC concentration is less than 0.3% by dry weight, from the CSA and allows for industrial hemp production and sale in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has retained authority over the addition of CBD and other cannabinoids to products that fall within the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (''FDCA"). To date, the FDA deems that it is currently illegal to add CBD to a food or beverage, and the FDA does not deem CBD a dietary supplement as the agency cannot conclude that CBD is "generally recognized as safe" among qualified experts for its use in human or animal food. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve CBD as an additive to products under the FDCA.
 There are three major pieces of cannabis legislation currently in process, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (“MORE”) Act, the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (“STATES”) Act and the Secure and Fair Enforcement (“SAFE”) Banking Act. 
 The MORE Act passed the House of Representatives in December 2020, but the bill did not advance to the Senate. The MORE Act has been reintroduced to the House of Representatives on May 28, 2021 with some minor changes. The December 2020 vote marked the first time in over fifty years that a chamber of Congress addressed ending the federal criminalization of marijuana. If the revised MORE Act is passed by the House of Representatives, the next step for the MORE Act is introduction to the Senate. The MORE Act would deschedule and decriminalize cannabis at the federal level. The MORE Act would remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances, allow states to set their own marijuana policy and establishes a process to expunge convictions and conduct hearings related to prior federal cannabis offenses. The MORE Act also institutes a five percent federal sales tax on all cannabis products and creates a trust that utilizes the tax revenue to support various programs and services in communities impacted by the war on drugs.
 10


In addition, the MORE Act would impact Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, which forbids businesses engaged in the trafficking of a Schedule I or II controlled substance from deducting ordinary business expenses to reduce their taxable income. Currently, a cannabis-related business can only deduct cost of goods before taxation, resulting in significantly higher effective tax rates than a non-cannabis business. If cannabis were removed from the Schedule I designation, cannabis-related businesses would be able to deduct employee salaries, rent, marketing, advertising and other selling, general and administrative costs from their operating income.  
 The STATES Act was originally introduced to Congress in 2017 and was re-introduced in 2019. The STATES Act eliminates regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the CSA for certain marijuana-related activities that comply with state or tribal law. The STATES Act creates an exemption in the CSA to allow states to determine their own cannabis policies without fear of federal reprisal. The STATES Act does not legalize cannabis on a federal level but aims to protect individuals and companies acting in compliance with state and tribal law.
 The SAFE Banking Act passed the House of Representatives in September 2019 but has not passed the Senate. In September 2021, the House of Representatives included the SAFE Banking Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2022, but the SAFE Banking Act was removed from the Defense Spending Bill by a Senate conference committee in December of 2021. The SAFE Banking Act is designed to prohibit federal banking regulators from punishing financial institutions from providing services to legitimate cannabis companies, their owners, and employees. In particular, a federal banking regulator cannot terminate or limit deposit insurance, prohibit or penalize a financial institution from providing services to legitimate cannabis-related business or take any adverse or corrective action on a loan made to a legitimate cannabis-related business. 
 Under current federal law, it may be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes to take any proceeds from the sale of any Schedule I controlled substance. Financial institutions could potentially be prosecuted and convicted of money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act for providing services to cannabis businesses. In 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued guidance not to focus enforcement on financial institutions that serve cannabis-related business, as long as the business activities are legal in their state. Thus, most legitimate cannabis-related companies have established relationships with state banks and financial institutions. Also, since these legitimate cannabis firms do not have access to traditional bank financing, they primarily rely on private capital to address their financing needs.
 Since we do not conduct any cannabis-related business in the United States aside from our Balanced Health cannabinoid products and VF Hemp joint venture, the SAFE Banking Act would not alter the current financial services for the Company. However, the ability to access public capital for all legitimate cannabis-related companies could provide the industry with additional financing avenues not available today as well as reducing the overall cost of capital.
 In addition, several bills have been introduced in 2021 which further highlight the positive environment to pass federal legislation legalizing cannabis. The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act was introduced on July 14, 2021 by Senators Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and Ron Wyden. And the States Reform Act was introduced on November 15, 2021 by Representative Nancy Mace, the first time a cannabis bill was proposed by a Republican party member. Although the bills differ in many ways, both bills seek to deschedule marijuana from the Controlled Substance Act, impose federal excise tax provisions, provide justice reform for non-violent cannabis offenses, permit movement of cannabis products through interstate commerce, and transfer agency jurisdiction from the Drug Enforcement Administration. While federal legislation did not occur in 2021, states continue to introduce and pass their own legislation to mitigate federal constraints imposed on cannabis business within a state.
 Texas Cannabis Industry and Regulatory Overview
 The Texas Legislature meets every two years beginning on the second Tuesday in January and commencing for 140 calendar days. The 2021 session began on January 12, 2021 and ended on May 31, 2021. Texas advocates, lobbyists and some legislators attempted to take advantage of the current momentum behind marijuana policy reform in the U.S. and filed nearly three dozen bills for the 2021 session. The bills reflect similar policy reform presented at the national level, including criminal justice reform and decriminalization of marijuana possession, expanding compassionate use programs and repealing marijuana prohibition entirely by legalizing responsible adult use.
 While the 2021 legislative session was largely focused on addressing the catastrophic freeze and failures of the Texas energy supply, a modest expansion to the medical cannabis program, the Texas Compassionate Use Program (“TCUP”), did pass.  TCUP provides low-THC cannabis oil to registered patients who have a prescription from their physician. This legislation added post-traumatic stress disorder, any form of cancer, and any condition that is part of a medical cannabis research program to the list of conditions which qualify patients for TCUP.  The legislation also raised the overall THC by weight cap from 0.5% to 1.0%.  Since the law went into effect on September 1, 2021 through the period ending January 31, 2021, the patient count has risen by 120% from roughly 8,200 to just over 18,000 patients and the participating physician count has risen by 27% to just over 500. Consequently, advocates expect that Texas will open TCUP up to more license applications sometime in the near future.
 The legislature will not meet again until 2023.  Thus, any significant changes to Texas cannabis laws and policy will not occur until May 2023 or later.

Our Greenhouse Produce Segment
 The Company commenced its produce operations in 1989 and maintains produce operations under both its U.S. subsidiary, Village Farms L.P., and its Canadian subsidiary, Village Farms Canada Limited Partnership. The Company owns and operates four greenhouse facilities in west Texas totaling 130 acres and one produce greenhouse in Delta, B.C. totaling 60 acres. The Company also represents third party growers (based in Canada and Mexico) on a sales commission basis, which represents approximately 58% of the Company’s 2021 gross produce revenues.
 The Company grows tomatoes at its own facilities. Approximately 84% of its total 2021 produce sales were tomatoes, 10% peppers, 4% cucumbers and 2% mini-cukes, as compared to total 2020 produce sales comprised of 85% tomatoes, 10% peppers, 4% cucumbers and 1% mini-cukes. The Company sells produce predominantly to retailers in the United States and Canada. For both 2021 and 2020, roughly 84% of the Company’s sales were in the United States, respectively, with the top two customers comprising 22% of produce sales in 2021 and 27% in 2020. Retail direct sales were approximately 69% and 76% of total produce sales for 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the balance to wholesale customers who service small retailers or other markets such as food service.
 While the Company grows in greenhouses, as does its produce supply partners, produce production is lower in the winter months as compared to the summer months. As such, the produce business has seasonality to its produce sales. Historically, the Company has had higher sales in its second and third quarters and lower sales, due to lower volumes, in the first and fourth quarters.
 The produce business is competitive, and the Company’s primary competition consists of large commercial producers. There is an abundance of growers as discussed in the Greenhouse Vegetable Industry Overview, which has resulted in an oversupplied market resulting in our retail customers continually pressing for price reductions. Due to the perishable nature of the produce business, pricing is very sensitive to the daily demand versus supply in each produce category, with the Company’s primary category being tomatoes. We try to combat the commoditization of the tomato category by offering unique tomatoes such as the Heavenly Villagio Marzano® and Sinfully Sweet Campari® as a means of distinguishing Village Farms to our retail customers but the large tomato varieties such as tomatoes on the vine (“TOVs”) and beefsteak are still a predominant part of the Company’s produce business and industry sales. Our produce business has limited trademark or brand loyalty.
 Greenhouse Vegetable Industry Overview
 (A) The North American Industry
 The greenhouse vegetable industry in North America has experienced rapid growth over the past 20 years, particularly in the western regions of the United States, southwest British Columbia and southern Ontario in Canada, and concentrated areas in Mexico. Mexico is the largest producer of greenhouse tomatoes followed by Canada and the United States. 
 (B) Greenhouse Industry — United States
 The majority of greenhouse vegetable producers in the United States are located in the southwestern and western states, where the growing conditions are more ideal for winter growing operations and the possibility of year-round production. New greenhouse facilities have recently been completed and planned in the northern U.S. to be closer to major population centers. These facilities have lights to allow for production in the winter months. Producing in the winter months is advantageous as produce prices are generally higher, although with increasing Mexican production (which produce in the winter months), seasonal pricing fluctuations are gradually decreasing. The majority of greenhouse tomatoes produced in the United States are used for domestic consumption, and producers in the United States benefit from high yields, consistent product quality, year-round supply, and closer proximity to its customers. In order to meet domestic demand, the United States imports a significant portion of its supply of greenhouse tomatoes from Canada and Mexico.  
 In addition, many U.S. growers of labor-intensive crops rely on immigrant workers from countries such as Mexico. The demand for farm labor in the U.S. continues to grow while the labor supply remains constant or slightly decreasing, leading to rising wages and benefits. U.S. employers may utilize H-2A workers to assist in fulfilling their labor needs. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the lawful admission into the United States of temporary, nonimmigrant workers (H-2A workers) to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature. The H-2A worker has additional costs to the greenhouse grower as the H-2A program has set a Texas state-level minimum prevailing wage of $13.08 in 2021. Additionally, growers must pay for worker expenses, such as transportation costs and housing. 
 (C) Greenhouse Industry — Canada
 Among the North American greenhouse vegetable producers, Canada is the largest supplier from April to October. Several factors, including climatic advantages (cooler summer temperatures) and the proximity of greenhouse producers to consumer markets, contribute to Canada’s favorable positioning relative to the United States during that time period. The primary markets for greenhouse produce grown in British Columbia include the west and northwest regions of the United States, as well as western Canada, while the primary markets for Ontario produce include the east and central regions of the United States, as well as eastern Canada.
 12


The strengths of the Canadian greenhouse vegetable industry include its high yields and consistent product quality. The main weakness of the Canadian greenhouse industry relates to its lack of production during the historically higher priced winter months. However, because of the high volume of tomatoes produced in Canada during the April to October growing season, profits generated during this time period generally are sufficient to sustain producers through the full year.
 (D) Greenhouse Industry — Mexico
 Although Mexico was the last country to enter the greenhouse tomato industry in North America, it has more greenhouse tomato acreage than the United States and Canada combined. It should be noted there is no formal definition of a “greenhouse” and a significant portion of the greenhouse acreage in Mexico is very low-tech, shade field structures. The product from the shade facilities is in some instances marketed as greenhouse-grown, which until the recent update on the Suspension Agreement between the United States and Mexico, was not in violation of any regulations, but for the State of California, which has a strict definition of greenhouse-grown for produce sold within the state. Average yields and product quality in Mexico are comparatively low, as compared to U.S. and Canadian greenhouse operations. Currently, Mexican producers tend to grow a majority of their production during the fall, winter, and spring seasons as they have sufficient light levels to grow and cooler temperatures during these months, although the trend towards more sophisticated greenhouses is permitting a longer growing season as well as increased yields.
 Over the last several years, the greenhouse industry in Mexico has continued to make significant advances with respect to its growing expertise and ability to extend its growing season, which continues to put pressure on produce pricing. Mexican growers are continuing to invest in greenhouses and other technology to improve production and yields. As the greenhouse industry is a labor-intensive business, the labor costs are a significant portion of overhead. Mexico has a considerable wage advantage versus the U.S. due primarily to the lower cost of living in Mexico. The U.S. Federal minimum wage has remained constant since 2019 at US$7.25 per hour; the Texas prevailing hourly wage for H2-A workers is $13.08 in 2021 and $13.88 in 2022. Mexico’s minimum wage for 2021 was 141.70 Mexican pesos a day or approximately US$7.10 per day and increased to 172.87 Mexican pesos a day or approximately US$8.28 per day on January 1, 2022.
 Pricing
 Prices for vegetables fluctuate depending upon availability of supply and consumer demand. Greenhouse vegetable producers typically command a higher price for their products compared to field producers, as a result of the vegetables’ consistent quality, taste, appearance, and year-round availability. This higher price, combined with higher production yields for greenhouse produce, typically offset the higher costs associated with greenhouse production relative to field production. Production costs for greenhouse-grown produce are generally higher due to greater energy, labor, infrastructure, technological requirements, and more intense crop yields per acre. As the fresh produce market share of big box retailers increases, pricing is moving towards more contract pricing for six, nine or even twelve-month periods reducing some of the fluctuations with traditional seasonal pricing. However, contract pricing does not provide volume guarantees.

Human Capital
 We respect diversity and accordingly are an equal opportunity employer that does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions), gender identity or gender expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, military service and veteran status, physical or mental disability, protected medical condition as defined by applicable state or local law, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws and ordinances.  Our management team is dedicated to ensuring the fulfillment of this policy with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities, access to facilities and programs, and general treatment during employment. The Company is proud to bring together individuals from a wide breadth of industries, backgrounds, and experiences, and promotes a culture of belonging. Additionally, we respect the religious beliefs and practices of all employees and will endeavor to make a reasonable accommodation if those religious beliefs or practices conflict with an employee’s job unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. 
 Paid vacation time is available for all employees in accordance with the Company’s Paid Time Off (“PTO”) Policy. In addition to good working conditions and competitive pay, it is the Company’s policy to provide a combination of supplemental benefits to all eligible employees.  In keeping with this goal, each benefit program has been carefully devised.  The Company provides all full-time employees with life insurance and accidental death & dismemberment (“AD&D”) insurance beginning on their date of hire.  Currently, the Company pays the full premium for such coverage.  Eligible full-time U.S. employees may participate in the Company’s 401(k) savings plan beginning ninety days after the date of hire.  Currently, the Company matches a portion of eligible employee contributions.
 In Texas, Village Farms opted out of the state-run workers’ compensation insurance program. Village Farms is self-insured and utilizes private insurance to provide benefits to employees in the event of a work-related injury or occupational disease in lieu of workers’ compensation insurance. All employees outside of Texas are covered under our Workers’ Compensation policy, which also covers accidental injuries or illness which occur during working hours or conditions caused by work activities. Both our private insurance and workers’ compensation are paid by the Company. The private insurer provides for the payment of medical expenses and weekly compensation payments during the period of an employee's work-related injury or illness and Village Farms reimburses the private insurer in whole. In addition, Village Farms maintains stop gap coverage with their private insurance carrier to prevent the liability of a significant claim. The Company has a long-standing philosophy of taking pride in its practices to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of our employees. To ensure a safe and healthful workplace environment, the Company has established a program that serves to outline our commitment to this philosophy and the Company provides guidance to all employees on the standards for compliance. 
 In Canada, Village Farms and Pure Sunfarms offer competitive extended health care and dental benefits which include an additional health spending account, a sponsored group retirement savings plan with company matching and wellness days. As part of their wellness program, Pure Sunfarms hired a full-time occupational registered nurse to lead the wellness initiatives, guide the organization during the covid pandemic and cultivate best-in-class health, safety and wellness practices. Pure Sunfarms’ innovative wellness program offers opportunities to employees that include mental health wellness, yoga, mindful meditation and nutrition sessions virtually and on-site, along with one paid volunteer day per year to all full-time employees.
 In response to COVID-19, we implemented, and continue to improve, appropriate safety programs and protocols to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. We took proactive actions early on to protect the health of our employees and their families, including curtailing business travel and encouraging video conferencing whenever possible. We initiated protocols including the option to work from home when feasible, proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use and temperature screenings and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies. While we believe we have responded appropriately to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation evolves, we will continue to analyze additional mitigation measures that may be needed to preserve the health and safety of our workforce, our customers and the ongoing continuity of our business operations. Those measures might include modifying workspaces, continuing social distancing policies, implementing new personal protective equipment or health screening policies at our facilities, or such other industry best practices needed to continue to maintain a healthy and safe environment for our employees amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Social Responsibility
 Village Farms has stood by its core Good for the Earth principles since the Company’s inception over 30 years ago. Since its inception, Village Farms is guided by a Sustainable Agriculture Policy, which integrates three main goals, environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic equality. The Company’s greenhouse growing is the environmentally sustainable future of farming in its ability to preserve natural resources, such as reduced water usage while growing more on less land.  In Controlled Environment Agriculture, soil erosion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are largely neutralized.  In addition, Village Farms’ investments in the latest technological advancements, and its ability to produce higher yields per square meter, mean there is more GMO-free products grown with little impact to the environment. In addition, the Company’s clean energy facility converts methane gas from a nearby landfill to energy sources that are utilized in its greenhouses in Canada, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide heat and carbon dioxide for our crops.

The Company’s greenhouses rely on, and have successfully employed, non-chemical methods for pest control known as Integrated Pest Management, whereas beneficial insects largely alleviate the need for pesticides. Our greenhouses utilize biodegradable coconut fiber or rockwool, not soil, to support the plants in a hydroponic solution, so there is no soil erosion or loss of precious nutrients. Pure Sunfarms’ greenhouses installed blackout curtains to reduce energy consumption, mitigate light pollution and protect ecosystems to minimize the impact to the greater Vancouver area. At all greenhouse facilities, Village Farms sterilizes and recirculates water numerous times. In Texas, discharged water is used to irrigate an adjacent track of land where a local rancher is then able to graze his cattle year-round and in Delta, B.C., Pure Sunfarms collects rainwater throughout the year to minimize the use of external water sources while utilizing renewable hydroelectricity as its main power source. 
 Rose LifeScience’s indoor controlled growing facility in Quebec was granted environmental rebates from the local government for its energy efficient design. The facility is digitally responsive as the growing rooms are equipped with technology that interprets and responds to the needs of the growers and the plants. The energy-conscious building design helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the facility is outfitted with special filtration to reduce odors and minimize any impact to the local community.
 Balanced Health is intensely focused on product quality and conducts internal and third-party quality testing across the supply chain and at all stages of the cannabinoid creation process to confirm the purity and concentration of its products. All hemp utilized by BHB is required to be non-GMO, pesticide free and is tested for compliance. Balanced Health is one of thirteen companies awarded U.S. Hemp Authority Certification for its commitment to quality and safety of its products and has also achieved Generally Recognized as Safe designation, an evaluation that its products are recognized as safe for consumption for full-spectrum, broad-spectrum and isolate CBD. 
 The Company has memberships in core industry associations such as the United Fresh Produce Association and the Produce Marketing Association, where leaders explore strategies and provide solutions to expand fresh produce consumption and strive to feed a growing world population. Pure Sunfarms is the founder of Cannabis Cultivators of B.C. dedicated to advocating for the growth of a responsible cannabis industry and advancing a favorable social, economic and business environment for cannabis cultivation in B.C. Village Farms continues to contribute and distribute fresh produce to help feed those in need, as well as champion volunteer efforts in national food banks, such as Feeding America and Conscious Alliance. Donation efforts to food banks and food pantries are also localized in all the regions where company offices and facilities are located. On a community level, local involvement in organizations such as the Canadian Cancer Society, American Lung Association, Wounded Warrior Fund, NAACP education fund, Rotary clubs, hospitals, and community art outreach activities, are just some of the diverse charitable contributions the company supports.
