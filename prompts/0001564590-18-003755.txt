Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a global wellness company and the world’s leading commercial weight management program. We are focused on inspiring people to adopt healthy habits and helping people lead healthier, more active and more fulfilling lives. With over five decades of weight management experience, expertise and know-how, we have established Weight Watchers as one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight-conscious consumers. We educate our members and provide them with guidance and a supportive community to enable them to develop healthy habits for real life. Weight Watchers-branded services and products include meetings conducted by us and our franchisees, digital offerings provided through our websites, mobile sites and apps, consumer products sold at meetings and through our websites, licensed and endorsed products sold in retail channels and magazine subscriptions and other publications. Our primary sources of revenue are subscriptions for our commitment plans for Weight Watchers meetings and Online subscriptions. Our “meetings” business refers to providing access to combined meetings and digital offerings to our commitment plan subscribers (including Total Access subscribers), as well as access to meetings to our “pay-as-you-go” members and other meetings members. “Online” refers to Weight Watchers Online, Weight Watchers OnlinePlus, Personal Coaching and other digital subscription products.
 We believe that the power of our communities increases accountability and provides our members with inspiration, human connection, and support, which inspires them and enables them to continue building healthier and more fulfilling food, activity and lifestyle habits. Our brands enjoy high awareness and credibility among all types of consumers—women and men, consumers online and offline, the support-inclined and the self-help-inclined. We believe that our program conveys an image of healthy, livable, sustainable and effective weight management in a supportive environment. The efficacy of our commercial weight management programs has been clinically proven in numerous studies and trials. As the number of overweight and obese people worldwide grows, the demand for an effective, scalable and consumer-friendly weight management program increases. We believe our global presence and brand awareness uniquely position us in the global weight management market. We continue to explore different channels to access this market. 
 In the more than 50 years since our founding, we have built our business by helping millions of people around the world lose weight through a sensible, sustainable and livable approach to food, activity, behavior modification and group support. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we had a total of approximately 3.2 million subscribers. At that time, we had approximately 1.3 million meeting subscribers, who could attend approximately 31,000 Weight Watchers meetings each week around the world, which were run by approximately 8,600 leaders. We also believe we are the leading global provider of paid digital subscription weight management products. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately 2.0 million Online subscribers. Our strong brands, together with the effectiveness of our program, loyal customer base, unparalleled network of meetings and leaders, and strong digital offerings, enable us to attract new and returning customers.
 Business Organization and Global Operations 
 We have four reportable segments based on an integrated geographical structure as follows: North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe (CE) and Other. Each reportable segment provides similar services and products. Further information regarding our reportable segments and our geographic areas can be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Note 16 “Segment and Geographic Data” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information concerning some of the risks to which we are exposed resulting from our international operations and foreign currency exchange rates is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We operate in numerous countries around the world. Our “North America” reportable segment consists of our United States and Canada Company-owned operations; our “United Kingdom” reportable segment consists of our United Kingdom Company-owned operations; our “Continental Europe” reportable segment consists of our Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain (operations ceased in the first quarter of fiscal 2017), Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden Company-owned operations; and our “Other” reportable segment consists of our Australia, New Zealand, Mexico (operations anticipated to cease in the first quarter of fiscal 2018), and Brazil Company-owned operations, as well as revenues and costs from our franchises in the United States and certain other countries. Revenues from our North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and Other reportable segments contributed 69.7%, 7.6%, 18.3% and 4.4%, respectively, of our total revenues in fiscal 2017. Revenues from our North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and Other reportable segments contributed 68.6%, 8.7%, 18.1% and 4.6%, respectively, of our total revenues in fiscal 2016. Finally, revenues from our North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and Other reportable segments contributed 64.9%, 10.7%, 19.7% and 4.7%, respectively, of our total revenues in fiscal 2015. 
 Our Services and Products 
 Our Weight Management Program and Food Plan 
 In each of our major markets, we offer services and products that are based on our new weight management program, known as WW FreestyleTM in North America. The program encompasses a holistic approach for your body and mind to help our members lead a healthier, more active, more fulfilling life, and provides flexibility to make significant changes towards that life. It is comprised of a range of nutritional, activity, behavioral and lifestyle tools and approaches that can be personalized for maximum livability. Our program also gives members science-based techniques that help them keep a positive mindset. Our food plan, known as SmartPoints, was developed from a combination of advancements in scientific research and consumer insights, including from customers who experienced prior Weight Watchers plans. With the SmartPoints system, each food has a SmartPoints value determined by the food’s calories, saturated fat, sugar and protein content. Customers following the SmartPoints system can eat any food as long as the SmartPoints value of their total food consumption stays within their personalized SmartPoints “budget”. Since nutritious foods generally have lower SmartPoints values, this approach guides customers toward healthier eating patterns. The WW Freestyle program expands the types and number of zero Points foods, making the program more flexible and livable. Based on a personalized assessment included in the program, members and subscribers get daily and weekly SmartPoints targets. Our new program, which launched in December 2017, updated our existing weight management program known as Beyond the Scale in North America. Prior to the launch of Beyond the Scale and SmartPoints in December 2015, we offered a weight management plan known as PointsPlus in North America, or ProPoints in certain of our other geographies. 
 Our customers can participate in our program in two main ways: in-person group meetings and digitally. Within these two channels, we offer a variety of services and products to meet each customer’s preferences. Our leaders, when leading meetings and providing personal coaching, educate members and subscribers on our program and range of tools. In addition to providing support, our leaders also inspire members and subscribers to develop healthy habits using our methods. 
 Our Meetings Business 
 In our meetings business, we present our program in regular weekly meetings of 30 to 45 minutes in duration, conveniently scheduled throughout the day. Our group support system remains the cornerstone of our meetings. Members provide each other support by sharing their experiences with, and by providing encouragement and empathy to, other people experiencing similar weight management challenges. Leaders facilitate this support through interactive meetings that encourage learning through member-driven discussions and individual goal-setting. 
 The primary payment structure for our meetings business globally is through commitment plans. Under these plans, members generally receive unlimited access to meetings at a discounted monthly price plus free access to certain Online and mobile tools and 24/7 Expert Chat, where available. Pursuant to these plans, a fee is typically charged automatically to the member’s credit card or debit card on a monthly basis until the member elects to cancel. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately 1.3 million meeting subscribers to our commitment plans.

In fiscal 2017, revenues from our franchisees represented less than 1% of our total revenues. Franchisees typically pay us a fee equal to 10% of their meeting fee revenues. We have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with our franchisees over many years. In our early years, we used an aggressive franchising strategy to quickly establish a meeting infrastructure to pre-empt competition. Since then, we have acquired a large number of franchises. Our franchisees are responsible for operating classes in their franchise class territory using the program and marketing guidelines we have developed. We provide a central support system for the program and our brand. In many of our markets, franchisees purchase products from us at wholesale prices for resale directly to members. Franchisees are obligated to adhere strictly to our program content guidelines, with the freedom to control pricing, class locations, operational structure and local promotions. Franchisees provide local operational expertise, advertising and public relations. Most franchise agreements are perpetual and can be terminated only upon a material breach or bankruptcy of the franchisee. 
 Our Online Business 
 In our Online business, we offer various digital subscription products, including Weight Watchers OnlinePlus and a weight management companion for Weight Watchers meetings members who want to digitally manage the day-to-day aspects of their weight management plan. These products provide interactive and personalized resources that allow users to follow our weight management program via our web-based and mobile app products. 
 Our Online subscription products are based on the Weight Watchers approach to weight management and provide additional tools to our meetings members, as applicable. They help subscribers adopt a healthier and more active lifestyle and positive mindset, and adopt healthy habits, with a view toward long-term behavior modification—a key aspect of the Weight Watchers approach toward sustainable weight loss. These products provide subscribers with web and mobile app content, functionality and resources and interactive mobile and web-based weight management plans. We believe our personalized and interactive Online subscription products give subscribers an engaging weight management experience. Our online community, which can be accessed via the web and the Connect feature in our mobile app, gives our subscribers a way to stay virtually connected, and support and motivate each other. 
 We believe that mobile weight management tools and resources are an important market opportunity for us. Our mobile phone (iPhone® and Android™) and iPad® apps provide commitment plan purchasers and Online subscribers with access to a suite of weight-loss tools, such as recipe and tracking tools, as well as other helpful content and the ability to scan the barcodes of food products for their SmartPoints values. We are continuing to upgrade the design, usability and features of, as well as improve the capabilities of, our digital products, including integrating with popular activity-tracking devices and wireless weight scales. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately 2.0 million Online subscribers. 
 Our Consumer Product Sales 
 We sell a range of consumer products, including bars, snacks, cookbooks, food and restaurant guides with SmartPoints values and Weight Watchers magazines, and certain third-party products. These products complement our weight management program and help our customers in their weight management efforts. We have focused on selling products that drive recurring purchases. Our products are designed to be high quality and offer benefits related to the Weight Watchers program.
 We sell our products through our meetings business, online and to our franchisees. Excluding sales to or by our franchisees, in fiscal 2017, sales of products in our meetings business and online represented approximately 13.2% of our revenues. We seek to optimize our product offerings by updating existing products, selectively introducing new products and sharing best practices across geographies. Additionally, non-members and non-subscribers can also purchase our products through our ecommerce platforms.

Licensing and Endorsements 
 We license the Weight Watchers trademarks and our other intellectual property in certain categories of food, beverages and other relevant consumer products and services. We also endorse carefully selected branded consumer products and services. By partnering with carefully selected companies in categories relevant and helpful to weight- and health-conscious consumers, we have a high margin licensing business that gives us access to these consumers and also increases the awareness of our brands. In connection with our acquisition from the H.J. Heinz Company, or Heinz, in September 1999, Heinz received a perpetual royalty-free license to continue using our brand in certain food categories. We believe that the strength of the Weight Watchers brands will create new long-term licensing and partnership opportunities for us.
Publishing 
 Weight Watchers magazines are published in most of our major markets. We also issue other publications, such as cookbooks and food and restaurant guides with SmartPoints values, which complement our weight management program. 
Health Solutions
 As healthcare costs continue to be a significant concern on the minds of employers and their employees, we believe that our broad range of services and products uniquely positions us to serve the market and help employers reduce their healthcare costs and improve the overall well-being of their employees. Our strategy is focused on leveraging our organizational capability to serve companies of every size and type by offering convenient and flexible weight-loss solutions that include workplace meetings, local community meetings and access to Weight Watchers Online. 
 We believe the healthcare market represents an important channel to reach new consumers. We continue to explore different approaches to this market. 
 Our Clinical Efficacy and Reputation in the Marketplace 
 Weight Watchers is one of the most clinically-studied commercial weight management programs, with dozens of peer-reviewed publications in the last 20 years. For example, in 2017, a randomized controlled trial conducted by research teams at the University of Cambridge, the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford and partially funded by us was published in The Lancet and found that adults with obesity referred to Weight Watchers for one year lost significantly more weight and were able to keep it off for longer compared to those who either received brief advice and self-help materials, or who were referred to a 12-week Weight Watchers program. It also found that those adults on both the 12- and 52-week Weight Watchers program had greater blood sugar control and greater reductions in body fat than those on the brief intervention program. In 2016, a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Indiana University School of Medicine and funded by us was published in the American Journal of Public Health and found that adults with prediabetes following the Weight Watchers for Prediabetes program lost significantly more weight and experienced better blood sugar control than those following a self-initiated diabetes prevention program using supplemental counseling materials. Similarly, in 2016, a randomized controlled trial conducted by The Medical University of South Carolina and funded by us was published in Obesity and found that adults with Type 2 diabetes who followed the Weight Watchers for Diabetes program lost significantly more weight and experienced better blood sugar control than those in a standard diabetes care program. 
 In 2017, a six-month clinical trial of the WW Freestyle program conducted by the University of North Carolina Weight Research Lab and funded by us found that participants on the program experienced an average weight loss of 7.9% after six months, and among those participants who reported trying to lose weight in the past, 82.2% of participants reported that the program is easier to do and 92.6% reported that it gives them more flexibility in their food choices compared to other times they have tried to lose weight in the past. Our efficacy and the value of our offerings are also well-acknowledged in the marketplace. For instance, in 2018, we again were recognized by U.S. News & World Report in the “2018 Best Diets” rankings, including ranking #1 for “Best Weight-Loss Diet” and “Best Commercial Diet Plan” and tying for #1 for “Best Fast Weight-Loss Diet.”

Marketing and Promotion 
 Our communications with consumers and other promotional efforts enhance our brand image and awareness, and motivate both former and potential new customers to join Weight Watchers meetings or purchase our Online products. In October 2015, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Oprah Winfrey, pursuant to which, among other things, Ms. Winfrey provides us with services in her discretion to promote the Company and our programs, products and services, including in advertisements and promotions, and making personal appearances on our behalf. For example, in fiscal 2018, as part of our collaboration with Ms. Winfrey, she is appearing in our advertising campaign in the United States. Further information on this agreement and our partnership with Ms. Winfrey can be found below under “—History—Winfrey Transaction.” 
 We advertise primarily in national media vehicles (television, digital, print, radio, etc.), which are selected based on their efficiency and effectiveness in reaching our target audience. We develop and maintain a high level of engagement with current and potential customers on various social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. While our traditional advertising schedule generally supports the three key marketing campaigns of the year, winter, spring and fall, we communicate with consumers in the digital space throughout the year. Also, we utilize brand ambassadors, spokespersons and social media influencers, including from time to time celebrities, as part of our advertising and marketing. 
 In addition to the above advertising channels, we take advantage of other channels for which we are uniquely positioned given our long history and network of Weight Watchers leaders, members and subscribers. The word of mouth generated by our current and former customers, combined with our strong brand and known effectiveness, enable us to attract new and returning customers. We also carry out many of our key public relations initiatives through the efforts of current and former Weight Watchers leaders, members and subscribers, including from time to time celebrities. 
 Additionally, Weight Watchers Magazine reinforces the value of our brand and serves as an important marketing tool to both current and potential customers. We also utilize mailing campaigns and the WeightWatchers.com website to attract new and returning customers and to engage current customers. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal due to the importance of the winter season to our overall recruitment environment. Our advertising schedule generally supports the three key recruitment-generating seasons of the year: winter, spring and fall, with winter having the highest concentration of advertising spending. 
Competition 
 We compete in the global weight management and wellness market. The weight management and wellness industries include commercial weight management programs; hardware and software-based mobile app and web-based weight management programs and approaches; surgical procedures; the pharmaceutical industry; self-help weight management regimens and other self-help weight management products, services and publications, such as books, magazines, websites and social media groups; dietary supplements and meal replacement products; healthy living services, products and publications; weight management services administered by doctors, nutritionists and dieticians; government agencies and non-profit groups that offer weight management services; fitness centers and national drug store chains. 
 Competition among commercial weight management programs is largely based on program recognition and reputation and the effectiveness, safety and price of the program. In the United States, we compete with several other companies in the commercial weight management industry, although we believe that their businesses are not comparable to ours. For example, many of these competitors’ businesses are based on the sale of pre-packaged meals and meal replacements. In conjunction with a flexible food plan that allows customers the freedom to choose what they eat, our program uses group support and interactive, member-driven discussions to encourage learning and behavior modification to help our customers move towards a healthier, more active, more fulfilling life and adopt healthy habits. There are no significant group education-based competitors in any of our major markets, except in the United Kingdom. 
 5


We believe that food manufacturers that produce meal replacement products are not comparable competition because these businesses’ meal replacement products do not engender behavior modification through education in conjunction with a flexible, healthy food plan. 
 We also compete with various self-help diets, products, services and publications, such as free mobile and other weight management apps. 
 Trademarks, Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 
 We own numerous domestic and international trademarks, patents and other proprietary rights that are valuable assets and are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the jurisdiction in which the patent is granted. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary from country to country depending upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and through domain name dispute resolution systems. 
History 
 Early Development 
 In 1961, Jean Nidetch, our founder, attended a New York City obesity clinic and took what she learned from her personal experience at the obesity clinic and began weight-loss meetings with a group of her overweight friends in the basement of a New York apartment building. Under Ms. Nidetch’s leadership, the group members supported each other in their weight-loss efforts, and word of the group’s success quickly spread. Ms. Nidetch and Al and Felice Lippert, who all successfully lost weight through these efforts, formally launched our business in 1963. Weight Watchers International, Inc. was incorporated as a Virginia corporation in 1974 and succeeded to the business started in New York in 1963. Heinz acquired us in 1978. 
Artal Ownership 
 In September 1999, Artal Luxembourg S.A., or Artal Luxembourg, acquired us from Heinz. Artal Luxembourg is an indirect subsidiary of Artal Group S.A., or Artal Group, which together with its parents and its subsidiaries is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Artal. Currently, Artal Luxembourg is the record holder of all our shares owned by Artal. 
 WeightWatchers.com Acquisition 
 In July 2005, we acquired control of our licensee and affiliate, WeightWatchers.com, Inc., by increasing our ownership interest from approximately 20% to approximately 53%. Subsequently, in December 2005, WeightWatchers.com, Inc. redeemed all shares owned by Artal in it, resulting in our current ownership of 100% of WeightWatchers.com, Inc.

Winfrey Transaction 
 On October 18, 2015, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Ms. Winfrey, or the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Winfrey granted us the right to use, subject to her approval, her name, image, likeness and endorsement for and in connection with the Company and its programs, products and services (including in advertising, promotion, materials and content), and we granted Ms. Winfrey the right to use our WEIGHT WATCHERS marks to collaborate with and promote the Company and its programs, products and services. The Strategic Collaboration Agreement has an initial term of five years, with additional successive one year renewal terms. During this period, Ms. Winfrey will consult with us and participate in developing, planning, executing and enhancing the Weight Watchers program and related initiatives, and provide us with services in her discretion to promote the Company and its programs, products and services, including in advertisements and promotions, and making personal appearances on our behalf. Ms. Winfrey will not grant anyone but the Company the right to use her name, image, likeness or endorsement for or in connection with any other weight loss or weight management programs during the term of the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, and she will not engage in any other weight loss or weight management business, program, products, or services during the term of the Strategic Collaboration Agreement and for one year thereafter. 
 On that same date, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Ms. Winfrey, or the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Ms. Winfrey an aggregate of 6,362,103 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $43,198,679. The purchased shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company. Under the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, Ms. Winfrey has certain demand registration rights and piggyback rights with respect to these purchased shares. The Winfrey Purchase Agreement also provides Ms. Winfrey with the right to be nominated as director of the Company for so long as she and certain permitted transferees own at least 3% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 
 In consideration of Ms. Winfrey entering into the Strategic Collaboration Agreement and the performance of her obligations thereunder, on October 18, 2015, we granted Ms. Winfrey a fully vested option to purchase 3,513,468 shares of our common stock, or the Winfrey Option, which remains outstanding in full. The term sheet for the Winfrey Option, which includes the terms and conditions appended thereto, relating to the grant of the Winfrey Option is referred to herein as the Winfrey Option Agreement. The Winfrey Option is exercisable at a price of $6.97 per share, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 18, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances, including if (i) the Strategic Collaboration Agreement expires as a result of Ms. Winfrey’s decision not to renew the term of such agreement and (ii) a change in control (as defined in the Winfrey Option Agreement) of the Company occurs. The shares issuable upon exercise of the Winfrey Option are subject to certain transfer restrictions and a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company. 
 In connection with Ms. Winfrey’s purchase of our common stock and the grant of the Winfrey Option described above, Artal Luxembourg entered into a Voting Agreement with Ms. Winfrey on October 18, 2015, or the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Winfrey agreed to vote all of her common stock or preferred stock of the Company and other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any common stock or preferred stock of the Company so as to elect as directors such nominees designated by Artal. The Voting Agreement terminates on the date that any of the following occurs: (i) Artal (and certain permitted transferees) and Ms. Winfrey (and certain permitted transferees) collectively own less than 50% of our issued and outstanding common stock, (ii) Ms. Winfrey then has the right to be nominated as a director and has met certain eligibility requirements under the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, but is not elected as a director of the Company, (iii) Ms. Winfrey (and certain permitted transferees) collectively own less than 1% of our issued and outstanding common stock, (iv) the voting and related arrangements in the Voting Agreement, in our reasonable determination, constitutes a “change of control” in any of our debt agreements or (v) the parties to the Voting Agreement terminate such agreement by written consent. 
 
As a result of entering into the Voting Agreement, Artal and Ms. Winfrey are acting as a “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we continue to qualify as a “controlled company” under the applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE.

The transactions contemplated by the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, Winfrey Purchase Agreement and Winfrey Option Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the Winfrey Transaction. 
 Regulation 
 A number of laws and regulations govern our advertising and marketing, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, licensees, franchisees, employees and other service providers and government authorities in the countries in which we operate. Certain federal, state and foreign agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulate and enforce such laws and regulations relating to advertising and marketing, promotions, packaging, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. We are subject to many distinct employment, labor, commercial, benefits and tax laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including regulations affecting our employment and wage and hour practices and our relations with our employees and service providers. Laws and regulations directly applicable to data protection and communications, operations or commerce over the Internet, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy and taxation, continue to evolve. Our operations are subject to these laws and regulations and we continue to monitor their development and our compliance. In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations in the United States and internationally. 
 During the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials, claims for program success and program costs. In 1997, we entered into a consent order with the FTC settling all contested issues raised in the complaint filed against us. The consent order required us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of services and products and expired by its terms in 2017. From time to time, we have been in discussions with the FTC regarding such matters.
 Employees and Service Providers 
 As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 18,000 employees, a majority of whom were part-time employees. In addition, in certain of our markets, our service providers are self-employed and are not included in this total. We consider our relations with our employees and service providers to be satisfactory.
