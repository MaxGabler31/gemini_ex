ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1998 under the name of GCI Lakes, Inc., which name was subsequently changed to Lakes Gaming, Inc. in August 1998, to Lakes Entertainment, Inc. in June 2002 and to Golden Entertainment, Inc. in July 2015. Our shares began trading publicly in January 1999. The mailing address of our headquarters is 6595 S. Jones Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118, and our telephone number at that location is (702) 893-7777.
Overview
We own and operate a diversified entertainment platform, consisting of a portfolio of gaming assets that focus on casino and distributed gaming operations (including gaming in our branded taverns). Our portfolio includes ten casino properties located in Nevada and Maryland. Our distributed gaming operations involve the installation, maintenance and operation of slot machines and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores in Nevada and Montana, as well as the operation of branded taverns targeting local patrons located primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area.
Acquisitions
On January 14, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Edgewater Gaming, LLC and Colorado Belle Gaming, LLC (the “Laughlin Entities”) from Marnell Gaming, LLC (“Marnell”) for $156.2 million in cash (after giving effect to the post-closing adjustment provisions in the purchase agreement) and the issuance by us of 911,002 shares of our common stock to certain assignees of Marnell (the “Laughlin Acquisition”). The Laughlin Acquisition added two casino resort properties in Laughlin, 
Nevada to our casino portfolio: the Edgewater Hotel & Casino Resort (“Edgewater”) and the Colorado Belle Hotel & Casino Resort (“Colorado Belle”), whose operations are currently suspended due to COVID-19. The results of operations of the Laughlin Entities are included in our results subsequent to the acquisition date. 
Impact of COVID-19
The disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. It is unknown when the pandemic will be fully contained and how the uncertainties associated with the pandemic will continue to impact our operations and the willingness of customers to spend on travel and entertainment. Following emergency executive orders issued by the Governors of Nevada, Maryland and Montana in the week of March 16, 2020, all of our properties were temporarily closed to the public and distributed gaming operations at third-party locations were suspended. While we re-opened our casino properties and resumed our distributed gaming operations during the second and third quarters of 2020, the implementation of protocols intended to protect team members, gaming patrons and guests from potential COVID-19 exposure, including enhanced sanitization, public gathering limitations on casino, tavern and venue capacity, patron social distancing requirements, restrictions on permitted hours of operations, limitations on casino operations, which include disabling electronic gaming machines, and face mask requirements for patrons, has continued to limit our operations in 2021. While some of these restrictions were eased during 2021, our properties and distributed gaming operations may be subject to temporary, complete or partial closures in the future. Further, as a result of the impact of the pandemic, the operations of the Colorado Belle property remain suspended. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruptions on our business, we implemented various mitigating actions to preserve liquidity, including delaying material capital expenditures, reducing operating expenses and implementing a cost reduction program with respect to discretionary expenditures. Such measures remained in effect throughout 2021. To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance any future acquisition or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public or private credit and capital markets.
Operations
We conduct our business through four reportable segments: Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos, Maryland Casino Resort and Distributed Gaming. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our operations by reportable segment as of December 31, 2021. In light of COVID-19, certain amenities at our casino properties (including restaurants, bars, and other food and beverage outlets, and certain non-food and beverage areas such as table games, spas and pools) may remain closed or operate in a limited capacity.

(1) The operations of the Colorado Belle remain suspended. 
Nevada Casino Resorts
Our Nevada Casino Resorts segment is comprised of destination casino resort properties offering a variety of food and beverage outlets, entertainment venues and other amenities. The casino resort properties in this segment cater primarily to a regional drive-in customer base seeking a value-oriented vacation experience, with guests typically traveling from Southern California or Arizona. Our casino resort properties in Nevada have a significantly larger number of hotel rooms compared to the other casino properties in our portfolio. While hotel stays at these casino resorts are typically longer, the overall frequency of visitation from guests is lower when compared to our Nevada Locals Casinos. 
The STRAT: The STRAT is our premier casino resort property, located on Las Vegas Boulevard on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip. The STRAT comprises a casino, a hotel, a retail center and the iconic SkyPod, which includes indoor and outdoor observation decks, thrill rides and the SkyJump attraction. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming and sportsbook facilities in an 80,000 square foot casino, The STRAT offers nine restaurants, two rooftop pools, a fitness center, retail shops and entertainment facilities.
Laughlin casinos: We own and operate three casino resorts in Laughlin, Nevada, which is located approximately 90 miles from Las Vegas on the western bank of the Colorado River. Our Laughlin casinos are situated on 56 adjacent acres along the heart of the Laughlin Riverwalk and cater primarily to patrons traveling from Arizona and Southern California, and customers from Nevada seeking an alternative to the Las Vegas experience. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming and sportsbook facilities, the Aquarius has eight restaurants, the Edgewater offers five restaurants, and the Colorado Belle offered three restaurants. As noted above, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of the Colorado Belle remain suspended. The Edgewater also offers dedicated entertainment venues, including the Laughlin Event Center. The Laughlin Event Center, which is situated within walking distance from the Edgewater and in close proximity to our other Laughlin properties, is an outdoor arena that can seat up to 12,000 guests and hosts various entertainment programs throughout the year, such as concerts, festivals, bull riding, rodeo, off-road racing and extreme sports events. 
Nevada Locals Casinos
Our Nevada Locals Casinos segment is comprised of casino properties that cater to local customers who generally live within a five-mile radius. Our locals casino properties typically experience a higher frequency of customer visits compared to our casino resort properties in Nevada and Maryland, with many of our customers visiting our Nevada Locals Casinos on a weekly basis. The casino properties within this reportable segment have no or a limited number of hotel rooms and offer fewer food and beverage outlets or other amenities, with revenues primarily generated from slot machine play. 
Arizona Charlie’s casinos: Our Arizona Charlie’s Boulder and Arizona Charlie’s Decatur casino properties primarily serve local Las Vegas gaming patrons, and provide an alternative experience to the Las Vegas Strip. Arizona Charlie’s Boulder is located on Boulder Highway, in an established retail and residential neighborhood in the eastern metropolitan area of Las Vegas. The property is easily accessible from I-515, the primary east/west highway in Las Vegas. Arizona Charlie’s Decatur is located four miles west of the Las Vegas Strip in the heavily populated west Las Vegas area, and is easily accessible from US Route 95, a major highway in Las Vegas. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming, sportsbook and bingo facilities, Arizona Charlie’s Boulder offers five restaurants and an RV park with 221 RV hook-up sites and Arizona Charlie’s Decatur offers five restaurants.
Pahrump casinos: We own and operate three casino properties in Pahrump, Nevada, which is located approximately 60 miles from Las Vegas and is a gateway to Death Valley National Park. In addition to gaming, sportsbook and bingo facilities at our Pahrump casino properties, Pahrump Nugget offers 69 hotel rooms, a bowling center and a 5,200 square foot banquet and event center and Lakeside Casino & RV Park offers 159 RV hook-up sites.
Maryland Casino Resort
Our Maryland Casino Resort segment is comprised of our Rocky Gap casino resort, which is geographically disparate from our Nevada properties, operates in a separate regulatory jurisdiction and has only a limited number of hotel rooms compared to our Nevada Casino Resorts. Rocky Gap caters to a regional drive-in customer base traveling from mid-Atlantic areas (Maryland, Virginia, Washington DC, Pennsylvania, West Virginia) and offers a full range of amenities, including various food and beverage outlets, signature golf course, spa and pool.
Rocky Gap: Rocky Gap is situated on approximately 270 acres in the Rocky Gap State Park in Maryland, which we lease from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (the “Maryland DNR”) under a 40-year ground lease expiring in 2052 (plus a 20-year renewal option). In addition to hotel rooms and gaming, Rocky Gap offers three restaurants, a spa and the only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course in Maryland. Rocky Gap is a AAA Four Diamond Award® winning resort and includes an event and conference center.
Distributed Gaming
Our Distributed Gaming segment is comprised of the operation of slot machines and amusement devices in approximately 1,100 non-casino locations, such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores, across Nevada and Montana, with a limited number of slot machines in each location. We own and operate over 11,800 slot machines and amusement devices as part of our Distributed Gaming segment, with the majority of gaming devices offered at these locations being video poker machines. Distributed Gaming operations cater to local residents with high frequency visitation to these locations. We place our slot machines and amusement devices in locations where we believe they will receive maximum customer traffic. 
As part of our Distributed Gaming segment, we own and operate a limited number of branded tavern locations, where we control the food and beverage operations as well as the slot machines located within the tavern. Our branded taverns offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages, and are 
typically limited to 15 slot machines. Most of our taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area and cater to local patrons seeking more convenient entertainment establishments than traditional casino properties. Our tavern patrons are typically younger than traditional casino customers, which diversifies our customer demographic. Our tavern brands include PT’s Pub, PT’s Gold, PT’s Ranch, Sean Patrick’s, Sierra Gold and SG Bar. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated 66 branded taverns, which offered a total of over 1,000 onsite slot machines. We continue to look for opportunistic and accretive opportunities to pursue additional tavern openings and acquisitions. 
In August 2017, we became licensed as a video gaming terminal operator in Illinois and in October 2018, we received a conditional license to operate in Pennsylvania, providing for potential expansion into new jurisdictions.
Nevada law limits distributed gaming operations (also known as “restricted gaming” operations) to certain types of non-casino locations, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns and liquor stores, where gaming is incidental to the primary business being conducted at the location and games are generally limited to 15 or fewer slot machines and no other forms of gaming activity. The gaming area in these business locations is typically small, and in many instances, segregated from the primary business area, including the use of alcoves in grocery stores and drug stores and installation of slot machines into the physical bar (also known as “bar top” slot machines) in bars and taverns. Such segregation provides greater oversight and supervision of the slot machines. Under Montana law, distributed gaming operations are limited to business locations licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption only, with such locations generally restricted to offering a maximum of 20 slot machines.
In Nevada, we generally enter into two types of slot placement contracts as part of our distributed gaming business: space lease agreements and participation agreements. Under space lease agreements, we pay a fixed monthly rental fee for the right to install, maintain and operate our slot machines at a business location and we are the sole holder of the applicable gaming license that allows us to operate such slot machines. Under participation agreements, the business location retains a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our slot machines, and as a result both the business location and Golden are required to hold a state issued gaming license. In Montana, our slot and amusement device placement contracts are all participation agreements.
Sales and Marketing
We market our Nevada Casino Resorts through both local and regional advertising, with a focus on offering a more complete resort destination experience that may include rooms, entertainment, dining and attractions. We advertise through various media channels, including television, radio, outdoor, digital, social media and public relations.
Marketing for our Nevada Locals Casinos targets the local communities in which these properties operate with an emphasis on the gaming experience, casino promotions and dining. The advertising is geared towards a local audience and typically includes radio, outdoor, digital and social media with television used occasionally for promotional messaging and brand campaigns when appropriate.
Rocky Gap is located in western Maryland in close proximity to the affluent and heavily populated metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C., as well as two major interstate freeways. Rocky Gap serves as a premier destination for both local and out-of-market patrons. Our marketing efforts for Rocky Gap are primarily focused on attracting patrons through local and regional campaigns promoting both the amenities of Rocky Gap and the vast array of outdoor activities available in the Rocky Gap State Park.
Our Distributed Gaming customer base is comprised of the primarily local patrons that use our slot machines and amusement devices in contracted third-party locations and the primarily local patrons of our branded taverns. We seek to place our slot machines and amusement devices in strategic, high-traffic areas, including our branded taverns, and the majority of our marketing efforts are focused on maximizing profitability from a high-frequency, convenience-driven customer base.
Our sales and marketing efforts include our consolidated loyalty program, True Rewards®, designed to encourage repeat business at our properties, branded taverns and other participating distributed gaming locations, as discussed below.
True Rewards Loyalty Program
Our marketing efforts seek to capitalize on repeat visitation through the use of our True Rewards loyalty program. We offer our True Rewards loyalty program at all ten of our casino properties, as well as at all of our branded taverns and other participating distributed gaming locations. Members of our True Rewards loyalty program earn points based on gaming activity and food and beverage purchases at our casino properties, taverns and participating distributed gaming locations. Loyalty points are redeemable for complimentary slot play, promotional table game chips, food and beverages and grocery gift cards. All points earned in the loyalty program roll up into a single account balance which is redeemable at over 140 participating locations.
Our rewards technology is designed to track customer behavior indicators such as visitation, customer spend and customer engagement. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 637,000 active players in our marketing database, providing us with an avenue to drive customer engagement and cross-marketing opportunities across our casino and distributed gaming platform.
Intellectual Property
We pursue registration of our important trademarks and service marks in the states where we do business and with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered and/or have pending as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, among other trademarks and service marks, “Golden Entertainment” and “Golden Gaming,” as well as various names, brands and logos relating to our casino properties, customer loyalty programs and branded taverns. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in various jurisdictions in the United States in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects. We also hold a patent in the United States related to player tracking systems.
Competition
The casino and distributed gaming industries are highly competitive. Our casino business competes with numerous casinos and casino-hotels of varying quality and size in our markets. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
Furthermore, several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas, and Native American tribes may develop or expand gaming properties in markets located more closely to our customer base (particularly Native American casinos located in California and Arizona). The expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers, including legalized casino gaming in neighboring states and on Native American land, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
With respect to our distributed gaming operations, we face direct competition from others involved in the distributed gaming business, as well as substantial competition for customers from other operators of casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
In addition, we face ever-increasing competition from online gaming, including mobile gaming applications for smart phones and tablet computers, state-sponsored lotteries, card clubs, sports books, fantasy sports websites and other forms of legalized gaming. Various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition for our operations.
Regulation
Gaming Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. State and local government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers, key employees and business entity affiliates to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. These are privileged licenses or approvals which are not guaranteed by statute or regulation. State and local government authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain and maintain the gaming licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us and our business. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Our business is subject to extensive gaming regulation, which is costly to comply with, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Gaming authorities may, in their sole and absolute discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective states. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any gaming authority under these circumstances is typically required to be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. Our articles of incorporation require our shareholders to cooperate with gaming authorities in such investigations and permit us to redeem the securities held by any shareholder whose holding of shares of our capital stock may result, in the judgment of our Board of Directors, in our failure to obtain or our loss of any license or franchise from any governmental agency held by us to conduct any portion of our business. If any gaming authority determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of our privileged licenses or approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Our shareholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and, if a shareholder is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, that shareholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly. Our shareholders may also be required to provide information that is requested by gaming authorities and we have the right, under certain circumstances, to redeem a shareholder’s securities; we may be forced to use our cash or incur debt to fund redemption of our securities” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Our directors, officers and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various privileged licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find any of our directors, officers or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever our relationship with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.
Applicable gaming laws and regulations also restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt, and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.
The gaming industry also represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various federal, state and local legislators and other government officials have proposed and adopted changes in tax laws, or in the administration or interpretation of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Changes to gaming tax laws could increase our cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such change to the regulatory environment or the adoption of new federal, state or local government legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Other Regulation
Our business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. These laws and regulations are complex, and subject to change, and violations can lead to significant costs for corrective action and remediation, fines and penalties. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of 
property may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time that they occurred, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. As we acquire additional casino, resort and tavern properties, such as the casino properties we acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition, we may not know the full level of exposure that we may have undertaken despite appropriate due diligence. We endeavor to maintain compliance with environmental laws, but from time to time, current or historical operations on or adjacent to, our properties may have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. In that regard, we may incur costs for cleaning up contamination relating to historical uses of certain properties.
Many of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our branded taverns and casino properties to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authority for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages. In addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.
Seasonality
We believe that our businesses are affected by seasonal factors, including holidays, weather and travel conditions. Our casino properties and distributed gaming businesses in Nevada have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Rocky Gap typically experiences higher revenues during summer months and may be significantly adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our Nevada distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. Our Montana distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the winter due to the inclement weather in the state and less opportunity for outdoor activities, in addition to the impact from professional sports seasons during the fall. While other factors like unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.
Human Capital
We are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining a superior workforce. We have a long history and deep cultural commitment to service and authenticity. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,300 team members, which is a 6% decrease from December 31, 2020 when we had over 6,700 employees. The decrease in the number of our team members in 2021 was primarily driven by labor shortages. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 8,000 employees. We reduced headcount significantly during 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including the mandatory temporary property closures and suspension of our distributed gaming operations discussed above.
Mission and Values
In 2021, we continued to emphasize our organizational mission and values, as well as our “I CARE” guest service initiative. Our mission is to create authentic entertainment experiences where premium service is delivered at an exceptional value.
Our core mission is:
•To provide exceptional service to our guests
•To be accountable to each other
•To have integrity in all interactions
•To be urgent with purpose in our efforts
Our human capital initiatives reflect our commitment to aligning our workforce with our mission and values. 
Recruitment
In 2021, we offered employment to 5,584 candidates from a total pool of 31,785 applications, or 17.6% of total applications. As compared to 2020, we hired 3,541 more team members and received 9,785 more applications than in 2020. We recruit applicants by utilizing various recruitment platforms and sources in an effort to secure a diverse pool of applicants and ensure sustainability of our talent pipeline. We offer referral and retention incentives to remain competitive in a limited labor market. We also made wage adjustments throughout Golden to remain competitive with market conditions and to improve retention in line level positions.
In 2021, we established relationships with various local non-profit organizations to connect job seekers with employment opportunities within Golden and attended numerous career fairs throughout the year. Further, we enhanced job skills training initiatives so that those with a skills gap or no prior experience could receive training enabling them to perform job duties. 
Team Member Benefits
We engage with a nationally recognized compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our benefits program within the industry. As a diverse organization, we offer our team members several options for annual benefits enrollment, including enrollment by telephone, online or through an app, and we support multi-lingual options. Our comprehensive benefits program provides our team members with the flexibility to choose their preferred medical, dental and vision plans. In addition, we offer telemedicine, flexible spending and health savings accounts, life insurance and a retirement plan that provides an annual discretionary match. We also offer a variety of optional benefits to promote the health and security of our employees and their families, including disability insurance and expanded life insurance coverage, critical illness and accident insurance, legal, identity theft, auto and home insurance, and pet insurance. We view mental health services as a fundamental part of our benefits program and offer a comprehensive suite of related benefits, including online mental health counseling through our team member assistance program. Additionally, we offer extended benefits to employees with disabilities and chronic health conditions, including no cost Medicare and Medicaid assistance programs and prescription savings solutions for team members with chronic health conditions.
Training and Development
In 2021, we enhanced our learning management system, internally branded as “GEMS,” by adding 41 learning opportunities. New leader orientation and tavern leadership training has been facilitated through a monthly virtual classroom in the learning management system. Additionally, all safety and compliance training, except certain required hands-on certifications, has been added to the online curriculum. Certifications have been assigned to manage reoccurring safety and compliance requirements, including COVID-19 safety protocols. We also invested in equipment and resources to make online training more accessible to the team members, which resulted in the completion by team members of over 68,000 training courses in 2021.
Diversity and Gender Equity
As of December 31, 2021, the organizational makeup was 50.3% female and 49.7% male with approximately 39.0% of management roles held by women. Average rate of pay for female salaried employees falls within 10% of the overall average pay for male employees in the same category.
As of December 31, 2021, the ethnic distribution of the overall workforce was 53% Caucasian and 47% non-Caucasian (all other races). The breakdown for salaried team members was 69.8% Caucasian and 30.2% non-Caucasian (all other races) with 25.8% of management roles held by non-Caucasian team members.
Among the overall workforce, as of December 31, 2021, 67% were over the age of 40 and 33% were under the age of 40. Of those over the age of 40, 16% were over the age of 65. Individuals over the age of 40 represented 71% of the salaried workforce.
Employees and Collective Bargaining Agreements
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 1,600 of our employees were covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Other unions may seek to organize the workers of our casino properties from time to time. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including those represented by unions. 
At The STRAT, our employees are covered by three collective bargaining agreements. Our collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 501, AFL-CIO, as extended, expires on March 31, 2022. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Professional, Clerical and Miscellaneous Employees, Teamsters Local Union 986 
(Valet and Warehouse) expires on March 31, 2024. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 and Bartenders Union, Local 165 expires on May 31, 2023.
