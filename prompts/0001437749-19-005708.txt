BUSINESS
 
History
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Form 10-K to “Tapinator, Inc.,” “Tapinator,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Tapinator, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Tapinator is a Delaware company that was incorporated on December 9, 2013. On June 16, 2014, the Company executed a securities exchange agreement with the members of Tapinator LLC, a New York limited liability company, whereby the Company issued 36,700,000 shares of its common stock (representing 80% of its then common stock outstanding after giving effect to the transaction) to the members of Tapinator LLC in exchange for 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Tapinator LLC. The transaction resulted in a business combination and a change of control within its business purpose. Tapinator has focused exclusively on mobile games and applications since inception.
 
Overview
 
Tapinator develops and publishes category leading apps for mobile platforms, with a significant emphasis on mobile games. Tapinator’s library includes over 300 titles that, collectively, have achieved over 450 million mobile downloads, including notable properties such as Video Poker Classic, Crypto Trillionaire and Solitaire Dash. Tapinator generates revenues through the sale of branded advertisements and via consumer transactions, including in-app purchases and subscriptions. Founded in 2013, Tapinator is headquartered in New York, with product development and marketing teams located in North America, Europe and Asia. Consumers can find high-quality mobile applications from Tapinator wherever they see the “T” character logo.
Mobile Apps and Games Market
 
The proliferation of easy-to-use touch-based smartphones and tablets has created a market with unique characteristics and explosive growth for mobile apps and games in particular. Portability enables playing wherever and whenever the user has spare time, and many games are specifically tailored to provide short play sessions for such occasions. Compared to PC and console games, the mobile games market has low barriers to entry. Whereas many successful PC and console games have budgets for production and marketing in the tens of millions and often take years to develop, mobile games can be created in a matter of months. Currently, there are approximately 3.3 million mobile apps in Apple’s App Store, of which approximately 822,000 (approximately 25%) are gaming apps. In 2018 alone, there were approximately 97,000 new apps added to the store, of which approximately 21,000 were mobile games. (Source: http://www.pocketgamer.biz/metrics/app-store/)
 
Global consumer spending within mobile apps is expected to grow 92% to $156.5 billion in 2022 up from $81.7 billion in 2017 according to a May 2018 report from app analytics firm App Annie. Mobile games represented approximately 79% of the total spend in 2017 although this percentage is expected to decline to approximately 73% in 2022 as non-gaming apps increase their share of consumer spend in the app stores. According to March 2019 report by AppAnnie, in 2018, mobile gaming consumer spend exceeded the combined game spending total on home consoles, PC and Macs, and handheld consoles by 20 percent.

Within the global app economy, Tapinator currently participates in the sub-sectors of 1) consumer app store transactions and 2) mobile in-app advertising. According to a September 2018 report from research firm eMarketer, mobile will account for $76.2 billion of US media ad spending in 2018. That is more than TV ($69.9 billion)—and it's significantly more than print ($18.8 billion), radio ($14.4 billion) and out-of-home ($8.1 billion).  By the end of the forecasting period (2022), mobile ad spending is expected to more than double that of TV. The channel will make up $141.4 billion of US media ad spending, representing a four year growth rate of 86%, while TV will decline during this same period to $68.1 billion.
 
Revenue Model
 
The mobile gaming industry today relies primarily on a revenue model known as “free-to-play” (“F2P”) or “freemium,” which means that the games are free to download and play. Unlike traditional console based video games which are sold for a fixed retail price, the revenues from F2P mobile games are generated through a combination of in-game purchases (wherein the user purchases additional premium content, functionality or in-game currency with which they can improve or extend the game experience), and advertisements served within the game.
 
In order for the F2P revenue model to be successful, it requires that a game has a large base of non-paying users and an adequately sized subset of recurring paying users. As a result, the tracking and optimization of measures such as DAUs (Daily Active Users), ABPU (Average Bookings Per User), Player Retention Rates, and Player LTVs (Lifetime Values) are essential to the successful management of mobile games. Ongoing investments in marketing, product development, and live ops are therefore important to acquire, accumulate and maintain an audience of loyal, paying users.
 
Industry Value Chain
 
The components in the mobile gaming value chain from game development to player can be broken down into four distinct segments: developers, publishers, distributors and the owners of the IP. These functions are in some cases split up between different companies and in some cases some of the functions are performed by the same company.
Developers
 
Game developers are the creators of games, and it is often they who come up with the game concept, develop the history and characters behind the game, as well as technically write the code and develop the game. There are game development teams ranging from a few people to several hundred developers. There are both internal game development teams, where the publisher employs the game developers, as well as external game development teams who are independent of the publisher. It has also become increasingly common to outsource a growing number of content-creation functions to external studios. There are outsourcing studios that specialize in specific parts of the creative process, e.g. producing the artwork in a game. It is also quite common that the game development companies keep the core of production and creativity in the company and then outsource some of the more specific development to other companies with specific skills.
Publishers
 
The publisher’s role is to commercialize the game ideas and take overall responsibility for the product by partially or wholly funding its development, monitoring the development process, testing, adapting and controlling the quality and content of the game. Once the product is finalized, the publisher distributes and markets the game to distributors. Publishers can own the whole or parts of the development project, or alternatively, only act as publisher to a third party that owns the IP rights.
App Stores
 
Mobile games are primarily distributed via large application stores such as Google Play, Amazon and Apple App Store. According to App Annie, global app store downloads will grow from 178.1 billion in 2017 to 258.2 billion in 2022. Developers either approach application stores directly or via a publisher, if they are cooperating with one. The major distribution platforms offer a 70 per cent revenue share to developers for distributing their applications through their application stores.
 
IP Owners
 
Another important part in the gaming market’s value chain is the owner of the brand (the IP owner) upon which the game is based. The IP owner controls which game projects, based on their brand, are to be made. Who the IP owner is depends – it could either be a game development studio that has developed its own IP, a publisher which owns a portfolio of brands, or for example the copyright owner of a movie or book title on which a game is to be based.
 
Products
 
The Company currently develops two types of mobile apps and games. Tapinator’s Category Leading Apps (formerly known as Full-Featured Games) and Rapid-Launch Games.
 
Category Leading Apps
 
Tapinator’s Category Leading Apps (formerly known as Full-Featured Games) are unique products with high production values and high revenue potential, developed and published selectively based on both original and licensed IP. These titles require significant development investment and have, in the opinion of our management, the potential to become well-known and long-lasting, successful mobile franchises which can become market leaders within their respective categories. These apps are monetized primarily through consumer app store transactions and, to a lesser extent, through brand advertising. These apps are published primarily under the Tapinator brand.
 
We have had an excellent track record of successfully getting our Category Leading Apps featured at launch by the major app stores, including within Apple’s “New Games We Love” category. Beyond initial product launch, we acquire customers for these products via paid acquisition channels for those applications in which we achieve player lifetime values (“LTV”) that exceed cost per mobile install (“CPI”).

The following is a summary of our Category Leading Apps that we are actively investing in. Beyond the list below, we are actively engaged in new product development, but typically do not announce such initiatives until a specific product launch date has been set.
 

Figure 1: Category Leading Apps - Active Portfolio




Video Poker Classic 2.0 (scheduled for launch in March 2019): Video Poker Classic is one of the top three video poker games on iOS and is a leading video poker property on Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. On iOS, the title maintains over 22,000 reviews with an average score of 4.7 out of 5.0. One of the reasons for the title’s success is its consistency with a real-world casino experience. Our upcoming 2.0 version will add a video poker format that is very popular in real-world casinos – that of multi-hand gameplay. More specifically, we will be introducing Triple Play, Five Play, and Ten Play for all of our 39 game types. Video Poker Classic currently has the richest offering of any video poker title on mobile with regards to game types and functionality and this update will further raise the bar for the video poker category on mobile.
 
Solitaire Dash: Our horse-racing themed tri-peaks solitaire game received a significant update for its 2.0 version in June 2018 and, since then, we have produced significant updates to the game on a monthly basis . This has resulted in over 450 unique levels (new levels are launched each month), new power-ups that contribute to the monetization and engagement of the game, daily login rewards to maximize retention, and significant balancing/optimization to the game’s content. In short, we believe that Solitaire Dash is a best-in-class solitaire product based on its fundamental metrics. We previously announced a global distribution deal with Cheetah Mobile (NYSE: CMCM), a large China based mobile app publisher. Based on the metrics that we are currently seeing, we believe that user acquisition efforts should be able to scale in a profitable manner. We look forward to the results of expanded marketing efforts, as we continue to invest in the product development of Solitaire Dash. 

Crypto Trillionaire (launched globally on January 30, 2019): Crypto Trillionaire is our best-in-class idle tapper with a fun cryptocurrency theme (there is no use of actual cryptocurrency in the game). The title was featured by Apple as a “New Game We Love” upon launch and has generated almost 300,000 player downloads to date. It has reached the Top 100 Grossing charts for Strategy Games in the United States and is a top three search result for the term “crypto” in the App Store. Furthermore, it maintains an excellent review score of 4.7 out of 5.0 based on over 5,500 player reviews. In February, we released a significant update to the game with a multitude of new functionality including vehicles upgrades, unlockable skins, and new/premium characters. We have an aggressive update roadmap for Crypto Trillionaire that, we believe, will continue to improve the game’s core metrics including long-term retention. Currently, we have been able to achieve an LTV that is greater than CPI at certain levels of paid marketing. We believe that we will be able to scale paid user acquisition as LTV continues to increase with future product enhancements.
 
My Horoscope (in soft launch; scheduled for global launch in April 2019): My Horoscope is our new astrology application that monetizes through subscriptions and focuses on the areas of Horoscopes, Compatibility, Birth Charts, and Numerology. According to IBIS World, a publisher of business intelligence, supernatural and psychic services were a $2.0 billion market in 2018, and represent a market that has existed for centuries. Thirty four percent of American women read their daily horoscope at least once per month and 41% share their horoscope with friends, but the industry has yet to enter the digital age, relying on eighty seven thousand small business entrepreneurs who consult in person with limited marketing and digital offerings. The My Horoscope application features a clean, minimalistic design that appeals to both a younger and middle-aged demographic alike. The horoscope category in the app stores has proven that it is able to support top 250 grossing revenue products. We believe that My Horoscope is a unique addition to this evergreen category that we will be able to grow into a leading horoscope application.
 
Rapid-Launch Games
 
Tapinator’s Rapid-Launch Games are legacy titles that were developed and published in significant quantity beginning in 2013. These are titles that were built economically and rapidly based on a series of internally developed, expandable and reusable game engines. To date, these engines have been developed within the following game genres: parking, driving, stunts, animal sims, career sims, shooters and fighting. These games are monetized primarily through the sale of branded advertisements. Historically, our Rapid-Launch Games were characterized by low development and marketing cost and predictable portfolio returns. Since our formation, we have compiled a significant library of 300+ such games and, while the Company is not currently developing new Rapid-Launch Games, we believe our existing portfolio of these games will continue to produce a long-tail of revenues over the next several years. We do not currently use paid marketing to acquire new players for our Rapid-Launch games, but rather we achieve customer acquisition by relying extensively on app store optimization (“ASO”) and cross promotion within the sizeable network of 300+ Rapid-Launch Games that we currently operate. Tapinator’s Rapid-Launch Games are published primarily under the Company’s Tap2Play brand.
 
New Ventures
 
In January 2018, we announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Revolution Blockchain, to develop and publish distributed apps and games that leverage blockchain technology. Since then, we have launched two fully functioning products, Dark Winds and BitPainting. When we initiated this effort, we were enthused by the potential long-term opportunity but recognized that the blockchain gaming market was in its infancy. To that end, we previously communicated to our shareholders that we did not expect these efforts to contribute materially to our 2018 revenues. We are extremely proud of the high quality of both of these products and how they were brought to market both cost-effectively and on schedule. Despite the quality of these applications, we have been extremely disappointed by the lack of consumer adoption of both products. Based on our experience with these initial launches, we now recognize that the current addressable market for blockchain games is likely too small and too early to generate significant near-term value for our shareholders. Thus, we have chosen to suspend our investment in this area.

We will continue to selectively evaluate opportunities to invest in new ventures that we believe can both leverage Tapinator’s resources and can deliver significant long-term returns to our shareholders.
 
Strategy
 
In early 2017, we began a strategic shift to focus more of our investment and management resources into our Category Leading Apps business. We will continue with this strategy during 2019. We believe the potential size, quality and sustainability of revenues and earnings from the Category Leading Apps business is significantly greater than that of our legacy Rapid-Launch Games business. We completed this shift during the fourth quarter of 2018 and we are now primarily focused on developing and operating Category Leading Apps.
 
Our clear goal for our Category Leading Apps is to create a small number of franchise-type titles that have product lifespans of at least five to ten years, and where we can develop these titles into sustainable market leaders within their respective categories. In order to accomplish this, we understand that we need to achieve customer LTVs that exceeds customer acquisition cost, at scale. To date, the Company has been able to achieve this, at certain customer volumes, for three products: “Video Poker Classic,” “Crypto Trillionaire” and “Solitaire Dash.”
 
Competition
 
The mobile gaming industry is characterized by fierce competition, is growing rapidly, evolving constantly, and the possibility for innovative companies to succeed within it is significant. The mobile gaming industry is, in all respects, global and Tapinator has competitors around the world. More than 30 public companies around the world have significant portions of their business in mobile gaming content creation including:
-United States – Activision Blizzard, Zynga, Glu Mobile, Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts, Scientific Games
 -Japan - DeNa, Gree, Nexon, Sega, Sony, Nintendo and Gung-Ho
 -Korea - Gamevil, Kakao, NetMarble and Com2Us
 -Australia – Aristocrat Leisure
 -China - Tencent, Netease, Boyaa, Forgame, GameOne Holdings, OurPalm, IGG, ZQ Games, and DoubleU Games
 -Europe - Rovio, G5 Entertainment, Gameloft, Ubisoft, Modern Times Group, and Next Games
 
Major privately held mobile gaming companies also include companies such as Epic Games, Riot Games, Niantic, Jam City, GSN, Playtika and Scopely. Despite this seemingly large number of significant players in the market, there are also a large number of smaller developers with one or two games and the market remains very fragmented. We believe that, while it is still early for the mobile gaming industry, the market has begun to show signs of maturing and we believe that significant consolidation is likely to occur over the next five years. We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players with other mobile game developers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.
 
We compete more broadly for the leisure time and attention of our players with providers of other forms of Internet and mobile entertainment, including social networking, online casual entertainment and music. To the extent existing or potential players choose to read, watch or listen to online content or streaming video or radio, play interactive video games at home or on their computer or mobile devices rather than play social games, these content services pose a competitive threat.
 
Suppliers
 
Tapinator’s game studios are organized by game or genre and consist primarily of independent contractors. The Company’s development studios are currently located in the following locations:
-Hanover, Germany
 -Vancouver, Canada
 -Seattle, United States
 
Marketing

Historically, we have acquired most of our players through unpaid channels. We have been able to build a large community of players through cross promotion, editorial featuring, the viral and sharing features provided by social networks, and app store optimization strategies.  We are committed to connecting with our players and we leverage various forms of social media, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to communicate with them.
 
We also use traditional advertising activities, primarily mobile advertising spending on Facebook, Google and various video advertising networks. Customer acquisition through paid marketing channels is a core component of our Category Leading Apps strategy. Therefore, in late 2018, we began increasing our investment in paid user acquisition (UA), in terms of media spend, infrastructure and human resources to support this spend. We expect to continue to invest in this area during the foreseeable future as we ramp up our UA efforts to support our Category Leading Apps.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Tapinator owns trademarks for certain brands, namely the Company's own name ("Tapinator") and specific mobile games “Combo Quest,” "Video Poker VIP" and "Balance of the Shaolin." These trademarks are formally registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). The remainder of the Company's brands qualify as unregistered trademarks as these marks are used in commerce within the Company's games in the mobile app stores.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, and working with virtual currencies and storing information on the blockchain including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways), and anti-corruption. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players, and deliver products and services, and may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
 
Some of our games and features are based upon traditional casino games, such as slots and poker. We have structured and operate these games and features with gambling laws in mind and believe that these games and features do not constitute gambling. Our games are offered for entertainment purposes only and do not offer an opportunity to win real money.
 
Seasonality 
 
We generally experience increases in game downloads and resulting online game revenues in the fourth quarter and first quarter corresponding to increases in smartphone and tablet purchases during the holiday shopping season. Approximately 40% of our revenue was derived from the “advertising and other” category in 2018. Advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenues we derive from advertisements in our games.
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2019, we had 4 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees. Additionally, we use consultants as needed to perform various specialized services. The Company relies extensively on third party consultants and vendors for certain development and marketing activities. None of our employees are represented under a collective bargaining agreement.
