ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 
The Company was incorporated on January 30, 2008, in the State of Florida, as Maximum Consulting, Inc. and shortly thereafter changed its name to ZhongSen International Tea Company, with the principal business objective of providing sales and marketing consulting services to small to medium sized Chinese tea producing companies who wish to export and distribute high quality Chinese tea products worldwide. The Company commenced business activities in August 2008, when it entered into a related party Sales and Marketing Agreement with Yunnan ZhongSen Group, Ltd. However, due to lack of capital, the Company was unable to implement its business plan fully. On May 31, 2013, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition”) with Music of Your Life, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“MYL Nevada”). As a result of the Acquisition, MYL Nevada is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company operated as a syndicated radio network. The Company changed its name to Music of Your Life, Inc. effective July 26, 2013.
 
With the dramatic increase in music licensing fees and the decrease in traditional radio advertising formats, the Company found it difficult to achieve profitability with its Music of Your Life syndication radio service. In response to this, the Company began to explore partnering with products to be marketed through radio spots on the Company’s wide-reaching radio network. On August 16, 2018, the Company merged into The Marquie Group, Inc. (see below), a development stage health and beauty company for the exclusive right to market and sell the products under development.
 
Acquisition of The Marquie Group, Inc.
 
On August 16, 2018 the Company merged with The Marquie Group, Inc. (“TMG”) in exchange for the issuance of a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock to TMG’s stockholders. Following the merger, the Company had 102,277 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. On December 5, 2018, the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation providing for a change in the Company’s name from “Music of Your Life, Inc.” to “The Marquie Group, Inc.” On February 22, 2018 our FINRA symbol changed from “MYLI” to “TMGI.”
Operational Overview
 
The Marquie Group is a direct-to-consumer sales and marketing company with an exclusive pipeline of innovative health and beauty products. The Company markets these products through its wholly owned subsidiary Music of Your Life, a syndicated radio network heard nationwide on AM, FM and HD terrestrial radio stations, and simulcast over the internet. This is made possible by 30 and 60 second commercials airing every hour which are targeted toward the Music of Your Life listening audience. Broadcasting more than 40 years, Music of Your Life is the longest running music radio format in syndication.
Our Business Strategy
 
With the dramatic increase in music licensing fees and the decrease in traditional radio advertising formats, the Company found it difficult to achieve profitability with its Music of Your Life syndication radio service. In response to this, the Company began to explore partnering with a product line to be marketed through radio spots on the Company’s wide-reaching radio network. The merger with The Marquie Group provides access to a developing health and beauty line of products called “Whim” to market and sell directly to the consumer through a series of radio commercials and on the Company website at musicofyourlife.com. The Whim product line includes a regime of face care products and other beauty products as they become available.

Objectives
 
Our objective is to sell unique and well-branded products to the Music of Your Life listening audience through a series of local and nationwide radio commercials. To accomplish this objective, the Company will continue to explore relationships with product manufacturers for the rights to sell their products directly, circumventing the traditional advertising agency approach.
Market Advantage
 
Music of Your Life can be heard on AM, FM, and HD terrestrial radio stations across the United States and worldwide over the Internet. This well-established listener base gives the company a strong market advantage over the typical Internet radio service. Using cutting edge, low-cost technology for program delivery with the Barix system, the Company operates at lower overhead than its larger competitors.
Competition
 
Competition in the radio industry is fierce, however, the traditional style of delivering syndicated programming is limited to just a handful of offerings. Most of these competing services offer a wide range of programming with the potential to reach millions of listeners. However, these businesses rely upon advertising agencies for their commercials without the flexibility to partner directly with the companies offering goods and services. This can be a benefit to our competitors as these ad agencies usually produce profitable results. However, this is also a very expensive method for producing revenue. The Marquie Group approach is that of direct-to-consumer model which cuts the cost of commissions to a third party resulting in higher profits per sale and affords the company greater flexibility.
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2021, Marc Angell (Director and Chief Executive Officer) is the only non-employee officers and/or directors of the Company. The Company has no official employees. We currently have one part-time production person, an outside accountant, and an outside lawyer. Certain other executive positions have been identified, and we intend to fill these positions. Additional other support staff and other personnel will be hired when there is adequate capital available to do so.
 
We have undertaken preliminary investigations concerning candidates for the above positions and do not currently anticipate difficulty in filling such positions with qualified persons; however, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to hire qualified persons for such positions when needed. Additional positions to be filled may be identified from time to time by the Company. We expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys, and accountants as necessary.
 
The loss of our CEO Marc Angell would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. We intend to reduce this risk by obtaining key-man insurance if affordable insurance coverage may be obtained. We cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain such insurance or that the Company will be successful in recruiting needed personnel.
