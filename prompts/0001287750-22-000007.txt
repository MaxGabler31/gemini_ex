Item 1.    Business
GENERAL 
Ares Capital Corporation
Ares Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation (together with its subsidiaries, where applicable, “Ares Capital” or the “Company,” which may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our”), is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Investment Company Act.” We were founded on April 16, 2004, were initially funded on June 23, 2004 and completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on October 8, 2004. As of December 31, 2021, we were the largest publicly traded BDC by market capitalization in the United States with approximately $20.8 billion of total assets.
We are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC (“Ares Capital Management” or our “investment adviser”), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE:ARES) (“Ares Management” or “Ares”), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC (“Ares Operations” or our “administrator”), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in U.S. middle-market companies, where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are most attractive. However, we may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. We generally use the term “middle-market” to refer to companies with annual EBITDA between $10 million and $250 million. As used herein, EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.
We invest primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position), and second lien senior secured loans. In addition to senior secured loans, we also invest in subordinated debt (sometimes referred to as mezzanine debt), which in some cases includes an equity component, and preferred equity. First and second lien senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt of a given portfolio company. Subordinated debt and preferred equity are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. Our investments in corporate borrowers generally range between $30 million and $500 million each. However, the investment sizes may be more or less than these ranges and may vary based on, among other things, our capital availability, the composition of our portfolio and general micro- and macro-economic factors.
To a lesser extent, we also make common equity investments, which have generally been non-control equity investments of less than $20 million (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment). However, we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments.
The proportion of these types of investments will change over time given our views on, among other things, the economic and credit environment in which we are operating. In pursuit of our investment objective we generally seek to self-originate investments and lead the investment process.
The instruments in which we invest typically are not rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such instruments were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than “Baa3” by Moody’s Investors Service, lower than “BBB-” by Fitch Ratings or lower than “BBB-” by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services), which, under the guidelines established by these entities, is an indication of having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Bonds that are rated below investment grade are sometimes referred to as “high yield bonds” or “junk bonds.” We may invest without limit in debt or other securities of any rating, as well as debt or other securities that have not been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
We believe that our investment adviser, Ares Capital Management, is able to leverage the current investment platform, resources and existing relationships of Ares Management with financial sponsors, financial institutions, hedge funds and other investment firms to provide us with attractive investment opportunities. For purposes of this document, we refer to Ares Management and its affiliated companies (other than portfolio companies of its affiliated funds) as “Ares.” In addition to deal flow, the Ares investment platform assists our investment adviser in analyzing, structuring and monitoring investments. Ares has been in existence for over 20 years and its partners have an average of approximately 25 years of experience in leveraged

finance, private equity, distressed debt, commercial real estate finance, investment banking and capital markets. We have access to Ares’ investment professionals and administrative professionals, who provide assistance in accounting, finance, legal, compliance, operations, information technology and investor relations. As of December 31, 2021, Ares had over 750 investment professionals and over 1,350 administrative professionals.
While our primary focus is to generate current income and capital appreciation through investments in first and second lien senior secured loans and subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of eligible portfolio companies, we also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non‑qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered “eligible portfolio companies” (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.
Ares Management Corporation
Ares is a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager. As of December 31, 2021, Ares had over 2,100 employees in over 40 offices in more than 15 countries. Since its inception in 1997, Ares has adhered to a disciplined investment philosophy that focuses on delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns throughout market cycles. Ares believes each of its distinct but complementary investment groups in credit, private equity, real estate, secondary solutions and strategic initiatives is a market leader based on assets under management and investment performance. Ares was built upon the fundamental principle that each group benefits from being part of the greater whole.
Ares Capital Management LLC 
Ares Capital Management, our investment adviser, is served by an origination, investment and portfolio management team of approximately 145 U.S.-based investment professionals as of December 31, 2021 and led by certain partners of the Ares Credit Group: Kipp deVeer, Mitchell Goldstein and Michael Smith. Ares Capital Management leverages off of Ares’ investment platform and benefits from the significant capital markets, trading and research expertise of Ares’ investment professionals. Ares Capital Management’s investment committee has nine members primarily comprised of certain of the U.S.-based partners of the Ares Credit Group. 
MARKET OPPORTUNITY
We believe that current market conditions present attractive opportunities for us to invest in middle-market companies, specifically:
•We believe that many commercial and investment banks have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more new-issue market opportunities for us.
•We believe the disruption and volatility that occurs periodically in the credit markets reduces capital available to certain capital providers, causing a reduction in competition. Furthermore, in our view, the stable capital solutions provided by direct lenders is increasingly valuable and, as a result, widens the market opportunity for direct lending.
•We believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold our loans without having to syndicate or sell them is a competitive advantage.
•We believe that middle-market companies have faced difficulty in raising debt through the capital markets. This approach to financing may become more difficult to the extent institutional investors seek to invest in larger, more liquid offerings, leaving less competition and fewer financing alternatives for middle-market companies.  
•We believe there is a large pool of un-invested private equity capital for middle-market businesses. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources such as us.
4


•We believe the middle-market represents a significant portion of the overall economy, and exhibits healthy demand for capital. In addition, due to the fragmented nature of the middle-market and the lack of publicly available information, we believe direct lenders have an opportunity to originate and underwrite investments with more favorable terms, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, as well as better call protection and change of control provisions as compared to the large, broadly syndicated loan market.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 
We believe that we have the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies:
The Ares Platform
Ares operates integrated groups across credit, private equity, real estate, secondary solutions and strategic initiatives. We believe our affiliation with Ares provides a distinct competitive advantage through Ares’ originations, due diligence and marketing activities. In particular, we believe that the Ares platform provides us with an advantage through its deal flow generation and investment evaluation process. Ares’ asset management platform also provides additional market information, company knowledge and industry insight that benefit our investment and due diligence process. Ares’ professionals maintain extensive financial sponsor and intermediary relationships, which provide valuable insight and access to transactions and information.
Seasoned Investment Team
The investment professionals in the Ares Credit Group and members of our investment adviser’s investment committee have significant experience investing across market cycles. This experience provides us with a competitive advantage in identifying, originating, investing in and managing a portfolio of investments in middle-market companies.
Broad Origination Strategy
We focus on self-originating most of our investments by pursuing a broad array of investment opportunities in middle-market companies. We also leverage off of the extensive relationships of the broader Ares platform, including relationships with the portfolio companies in the IHAM Vehicles (as defined below), to identify investment opportunities. Additionally, our size and scale provide the opportunity to source attractive investments in some of our existing portfolio companies. Collectively, we believe these advantages allow for enhanced asset selectivity as we believe there is a significant relationship between proprietary deal origination and credit performance. We believe that this allows for asset selectivity and that there is a significant relationship between proprietary deal origination and credit performance. We believe that our focus on generating proprietary deal flow and lead investing also gives us greater control over capital structure, deal terms, pricing and documentation and enables us to actively manage our portfolio investments. Moreover, by leading the investment process, we are often able to secure controlling positions in credit tranches, thereby providing additional control in investment outcomes. We also have originated substantial proprietary deal flow from middle-market intermediaries, which often allows us to act as the sole or principal source of institutional capital to the borrower.
Scale and Flexible Transaction Structuring
We believe that being one of the largest BDCs makes us a more desirable and flexible capital provider, especially in competitive markets. We are flexible with the types of investments we make and the terms associated with those investments. We believe this approach and experience enables our investment adviser to identify attractive investment opportunities throughout economic cycles and across a company’s capital structure so we can make investments consistent with our stated investment objective and preserve principal while seeking appropriate risk adjusted returns. In addition, we have the flexibility to provide “one stop” financing with the ability to invest capital across the balance sheet and syndicate and hold larger investments than many of our competitors. We believe that the ability to underwrite, syndicate and hold larger investments benefits our stockholders by (a) potentially increasing net income and earnings through leadership of the investment process and making commitments in excess of our final investment, (b) increasing originated deal flow flexibility, (c) broadening market relationships and deal flow, (d) allowing us to optimize our portfolio composition and (e) allowing us to provide capital to a broader spectrum of middle-market companies, which we believe currently have limited access to capital from traditional lending sources. In addition, we believe that the ability to provide capital at every level of the balance sheet provides a strong value proposition to middle-market borrowers which supports meaningful deal sourcing and relative value analysis capabilities.

Experience with and Focus on Middle-Market Companies
Ares has historically focused on investments in middle-market companies and we benefit from this experience. In sourcing and analyzing deals, our investment adviser benefits from Ares’ extensive network of relationships focused on middle-market companies, including management teams, members of the investment banking community, private equity groups and other investment firms with whom Ares has had long-term relationships. We believe this network enables us to identify well-positioned prospective portfolio company investments. The Ares Credit Group works closely with Ares’ other investment professionals. As of December 31, 2021, Ares oversaw a portfolio of investments in over 3,100 companies, over 925 alternative credit investments and over 470 properties across over 60 industries, which provides access to an extensive network of relationships and insights into industry trends and the state of the capital markets. 
Disciplined Investment Philosophy
In making its investment decisions, our investment adviser has adopted Ares’ long-standing, consistent, credit-based investment approach that was developed over 20 years ago by its founders. Specifically, our investment adviser’s investment philosophy, portfolio construction and portfolio management involve an assessment of the overall macroeconomic environment and financial markets and company-specific research and analysis. Its investment approach emphasizes capital preservation, low volatility and minimization of downside risk. In addition to engaging in extensive due diligence from the perspective of a long-term investor, our investment adviser’s approach seeks to reduce risk in investments by focusing on:
•businesses with strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages;
•industries with positive long-term dynamics;
•businesses and industries with cash flows that are dependable and predictable;
•management teams with demonstrated track records and appropriate economic incentives;
•rates of return commensurate with the perceived risks;
•securities or investments that are structured with appropriate terms and covenants; and
•businesses backed by experienced private equity sponsors.
Extensive Industry Focus
We seek to concentrate our investing activities in industries with a history of predictable and dependable cash flows and in which the Ares investment professionals have had extensive investment experience. Ares investment professionals have developed long-term relationships with management teams and management consultants in over 60 industries, and have accumulated substantial information and identified potential trends within these industries. In turn, we benefit from these relationships, information and identification of potential trends in making investments.
OPERATING AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE
Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of Ares and its affiliates. Our investment adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the “Advisers Act.” Under our Second Amended and Restated Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with Ares Capital Management, referred to herein as our “investment advisory and management agreement,” we have agreed to pay our investment adviser base management fees based on our total assets, as defined under the Investment Company Act (other than cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) (“base management fees”), fees based on our net investment income (“income based fees”) and fees based on our net capital gains (“capital gains incentive fees”). See “Investment Advisory and Management Agreement.” Ares Operations provides us with certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate pursuant to an Amended and Restated Administration Agreement, referred to herein as our “administration agreement.” See “Administration Agreement.”
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, we are required to comply with certain substantive regulatory requirements. For example, we are not generally permitted to co-invest in any portfolio company in which a fund managed by 
6


Ares or any of its downstream affiliates (other than us and our downstream affiliates) is also co-investing. On January 18, 2017, we received an order from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that permits us and other BDCs and registered closed-end management investment companies managed by Ares to co-invest in portfolio companies with each other and with affiliated investment funds (the “Co-investment Exemptive Order”). Co-investments made under the Co-investment Exemptive Order are subject to compliance with certain conditions and other requirements, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. In addition, we are relying on a conditional exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 (the “Exemptive Relief”) that permits a BDC with an effective Co-investment Exemptive Order to allow an affiliated investment fund to participate in a follow-on investment in a portfolio company where such affiliated investment fund is not already invested. Although this relief expired on December 31, 2020, on January 5, 2021, the SEC stated that until March 31, 2022, it will not recommend enforcement action against any BDC with an existing co-investment order that relies on the Exemptive Relief. We may also otherwise co-invest with funds managed by Ares or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. There can be no guarantee that the Co- investment Exemptive Order will be further extended.
Also, while we may borrow funds to make investments, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant aspects. See “Regulation.” In particular, because we obtained the required approvals under Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, we must have at least 150% asset coverage calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act in order to incur debt or issue preferred stock (which we refer to collectively as “senior securities”) (i.e., we are able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
As of December 31, 2021, our asset coverage was 179%. 
In addition, as a consequence of our being a RIC under the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our asset growth is dependent on our ability to raise equity capital through the issuance of common stock. RICs generally must distribute substantially all of their investment company taxable income (as defined under the Code) to stockholders as dividends in order to preserve their status as a RIC and not to be subject to additional U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes. This requirement, in turn, generally prevents us from using our earnings to support our operations, including making new investments. 
INVESTMENTS
Ares Capital Corporation Portfolio
We have built an investment portfolio of primarily first and second lien senior secured loans, subordinated debt, preferred equity and, to a lesser extent, common equity investments in private middle-market companies. Our portfolio is well diversified by industry sector and its concentration to any single issuer is limited. 
Our debt investments in corporate borrowers generally range between $30 million and $500 million each. However, the sizes of our investments may be more or less than these ranges and may vary based on, among other things, our capital availability, the composition of our portfolio and general micro- and macro-economic factors.
Our common equity investments have generally been non-control equity investments of less than $20 million (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment). However, we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments. 
The proportion of these types of investments will change over time given our views on, among other things, the economic and credit environment in which we are operating. In pursuit of our investment objective we generally seek to self-originate investments and lead the investment process, which may result in us making commitments with respect to indebtedness or securities of a potential portfolio company in excess of our expected final hold size. In such situations, while we may initially agree to fund up to a certain dollar amount of an investment, we may subsequently syndicate or sell a portion of such amount (including, without limitation, to vehicles managed by our portfolio company, IHAM), such that we are left with a smaller investment than what was reflected in our original commitment. In addition to originating investments, we may also acquire investments in the secondary market (including purchases of a portfolio of investments).
We make senior secured loans primarily in the form of first lien loans (including “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position) and second lien loans. Our senior secured loans generally have terms of three to 10 years and our subordinated debt investments generally have a term of up to 10 years. However, we may invest in loans and securities with any maturity or duration. In connection with our senior secured loans, we 
7


generally receive a security interest in certain of the assets of the borrower and consequently such assets serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such senior secured loans. Senior secured loans are generally exposed to the least amount of credit risk because they typically hold a senior position with respect to scheduled interest and principal payments and security interests in assets of the borrower. In connection with our senior secured loans, we may be provided opportunities to invest in equity interests of the borrower, typically in the form of an equity co-investment. However, unlike subordinated debt, senior secured loans typically do not receive any stock, warrants to purchase stock or other yield enhancements. Senior secured loans may include both revolving lines of credit and term loans.
Structurally, subordinated debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to senior secured loans and is often unsecured. However, subordinated debt ranks senior to preferred and common equity in a borrower’s capital structure. Subordinated debt investments generally offer lenders fixed returns in the form of interest payments and will often provide lenders an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation of a borrower, if any, through an equity interest. This equity interest typically takes the form of preferred equity, an equity co-investment and/or warrants. The preferred equity, equity co-investment and warrants (if any) associated with a subordinated debt investment typically allow lenders to receive repayment of their debt principal on an agreed upon amortization schedule or at maturity while retaining their equity interest in the borrower. Equity issued in connection with subordinated debt also may include a “put” feature, which permits the holder to sell its equity interest back to the borrower at a price determined through an agreed formula. 
In making an equity investment, in addition to considering the factors discussed under “—Investment Selection” below, we also consider the anticipated timing of a liquidity event, such as a public offering, sale of the company or redemption of our equity securities.
While our primary focus is to generate current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments in eligible portfolio companies, we also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. See “—Regulation.” Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered “eligible portfolio companies” (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.
Senior Direct Lending Program 
We have established a joint venture with Varagon Capital Partners (“Varagon”) to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, primarily to U.S. middle-market companies. Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. and other partners. The joint venture is called the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (d/b/a the “Senior Direct Lending Program” or the “SDLP”). In July 2016, we and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $350 million. We may directly co‑invest with the SDLP to accommodate larger transactions. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required). 
We provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the “SDLP Certificates”), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of December 31, 2021, we and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates. The SDLP Certificates pay a coupon equal to London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a stated spread and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.
As of December 31, 2021, we and Varagon and its clients had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $6.2 billion in the aggregate, of which $1.4 billion is to be made available from us. We will continue to provide capital to the SDLP in the form of SDLP Certificates, and Varagon and its clients will provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP as discussed above. 

For more information on the SDLP, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio and Investment Activity—Senior Direct Lending Program” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P.
As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio company, Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P. (“IHAM”), an asset management services company and an SEC-registered investment adviser, managed 20 vehicles and served as the sub-manager/sub-servicer for one other vehicle (such vehicles are collectively referred to as the “IHAM Vehicles”). As of December 31, 2021, IHAM had assets under management of approximately $9.5 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the amortized cost and fair value of our investment in IHAM was $781 million and $936 million, respectively. In connection with IHAM’s registration as a registered investment adviser, on March 30, 2012, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to, subject to certain conditions, own directly or indirectly up to 100% of IHAM’s outstanding equity interests and make additional investments in IHAM. From time to time, IHAM or certain IHAM Vehicles may purchase investments from us or sell investments to us, in each case for a price equal to the fair market value of such investments determined at the time of such transactions.

We generally seek to invest in companies in the industries in which Ares’ investment professionals have direct expertise. The industries in the table listed below are where we have focused our investing activities; however, we may invest in other industries if we are presented with attractive opportunities.

(1)Includes our investment in the SDLP, which represented 4.9% and 7.2% of the total investment portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021, loans on non-accrual status represented 0.8% and 0.5% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, loans on non-accrual status represented 3.3% and 2.0% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively. 
Since our IPO on October 8, 2004 through December 31, 2021, our exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 14% (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately $36.6 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately $46.9 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 57% of these exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.
Additionally, since our IPO on October 8, 2004 through December 31, 2021, our realized gains have exceeded our realized losses by approximately $1.0 billion (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital Corporation (“Allied Capital”) in April 2010 (the “Allied Acquisition”) and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other assets). For the same time period, our average annualized net realized gain rate was approximately 1.0% (excluding a one-time gain on the Allied Acquisition and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other assets). Net realized gain/loss rates for a particular period are the amount of net realized gains/losses during such period divided by the average quarterly investments at amortized cost in such period.
Information included herein regarding internal rates of return, realized gains and losses and annualized net realized gain rates are historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured.
INVESTMENT SELECTION
Ares’ investment philosophy was developed over 20 years ago and has remained consistent and relevant throughout a number of economic cycles. We are managed using a similar investment philosophy used by the investment professionals of Ares in respect of its other investment funds.
This investment philosophy involves, among other things:
•an assessment of the overall macroeconomic environment and financial markets and how such assessment may impact industry and asset selection;
•company-specific research and analysis; and
•with respect to each individual company, an emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility and minimization of downside risk.
10


The foundation of Ares’ investment philosophy is intensive credit investment analysis, a portfolio management discipline based on both market technicals and fundamental value-oriented research, and diversification strategy. Ares also recognizes the importance of considering environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors in the investment-decision making process in accordance with its ESG policy. We follow a rigorous investment process based on:
•a comprehensive analysis of issuer creditworthiness, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the issuer’s business;
•an evaluation of management and its economic incentives;
•an analysis of business strategy and industry trends; and
•an in-depth examination of capital structure, financial results and projections.
We seek to identify those companies exhibiting superior fundamental risk-reward profiles and strong defensible business franchises while focusing on the relative value of the investment across the industry as well as for the specific company.
Intensive Due Diligence
The process through which an investment decision is made involves extensive research into the target company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If the senior investment professional responsible for the potential transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, we will engage in an intensive due diligence process. Approximately 40-50% of the investments initially reviewed by us proceed to this phase. Though each transaction will involve a somewhat different approach, the regular due diligence steps generally undertaken include:
•meeting with the target company’s management team to get a detailed review of the business, and to probe for potential weaknesses in business prospects;
•checking management’s backgrounds and references;
•performing a detailed review of historical financial performance, including performance through various economic cycles, and the quality of earnings;
•reviewing both short and long term projections of the business, and sensitizing them for both upside and downside risk;
•visiting headquarters and company operations and meeting with top and middle-level executives;
•contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and standard practices;
•conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the issuer to its main competitors on an operating, financial, market share and valuation basis;
•researching the industry for historic growth trends and future prospects as well as to identify future exit alternatives (including available Wall Street research, industry association literature and general news);
•assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth; and
•investigating legal risks and financial and accounting systems.
Selective Investment Process
After an investment has been identified and preliminary diligence has been completed, a credit research and analysis report is prepared. This report is reviewed by the senior investment professional in charge of the potential investment. If such senior and other investment professionals are in favor of the potential investment, then it is first presented to the investment committee on a preliminary basis.
11


After the investment committee approves continued work on the potential investment, a more extensive due diligence process is employed by the transaction team. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys, independent accountants, and other third party consultants and research firms prior to the closing of the investment, as appropriate on a case-by-case basis. Approximately 10-15% of all investments initially reviewed by us will be presented to the investment committee. Approval of an investment for funding requires the approval of the majority of the investment committee of our investment adviser, although unanimous consent is sought.
Issuance of Formal Commitment
Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management and/or sponsor of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, if any, to finalize the structure of the investment. Approximately 3-5% of the investments initially reviewed by us eventually result in the issuance of formal commitments and the closing of such transactions.
Investments
We invest in portfolio companies primarily in the form of first lien senior secured loans (including “unitranche” loans which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position), second lien senior secured loans, subordinated debt and preferred equity. The first and second lien senior secured loans generally have terms of three to 10 years. In connection with our first and second lien senior secured loans, we generally receive security interests in certain assets of our portfolio companies that could serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. First and second lien senior secured loans generally have floating interest rates, which may have interest rate floors, and also may provide for some amortization of principal and excess cash flow payments, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity.
We structure our subordinated debt investments primarily as unsecured subordinated loans that provide for relatively higher fixed interest rates. The subordinated debt investments generally have terms of up to 10 years. These loans typically have interest-only payments, with amortization of principal, if any, deferred to the later years of the subordinated debt investment. In some cases, we may enter into loans that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt or defer payments of interest (or at least cash interest) for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases our subordinated debt will be secured by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower.
In some cases, our debt and preferred equity investments may provide for a portion of the interest or dividends payable to be payment-in-kind (“PIK”). To the extent interest or dividends are PIK, they will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the loan or preferred equity by the amount of interest or dividend due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such loan or preferred equity and is generally collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal or redemption of the equity, as applicable.
In the case of our first and second lien senior secured loans, subordinated debt and preferred equity investments, we tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that aims to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to generally seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we will seek, where appropriate, to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
•targeting a total return on our investments (including from both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk;
•incorporating call protection and interest rate floors for floating rate loans into the investment structure; and
•negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights.
We generally require financial covenants and terms that require an issuer to reduce leverage, thereby enhancing credit quality. These methods include: (a) maintenance leverage covenants requiring a decreasing ratio of indebtedness to cash flow over time, (b) maintenance cash flow covenants requiring an increasing ratio of cash flow to the sum of interest expense and capital expenditures and (c) indebtedness incurrence prohibitions, limiting a company’s ability to take on additional 
12


indebtedness. In addition, by including limitations on asset sales and capital expenditures we may be able to prevent a borrower from changing the nature of its business or capitalization without our consent.
Our subordinated debt investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Warrants we receive with our debt investments may require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.
We believe that our focus on generating proprietary deal flow and lead investing gives us greater control over the capital structures and investment terms described above and enables us to actively manage our investments. Moreover, by leading the investment process, we are often able to secure controlling positions in loan tranches, thereby providing additional control in investment outcomes. 
To a lesser extent, we also make common equity investments, which have generally been non-control equity investments of less than $20 million (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment). However, we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments. 
ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES 
We believe that there may be opportunity for further consolidation in our industry. From time to time, we evaluate potential strategic opportunities, including acquisitions of: 
•asset portfolios;  
•other private and public finance companies, business development companies and asset managers; and  
•selected secondary market assets. 
We have been in, and from time to time may engage in, discussions with counterparties in respect of various potential strategic acquisition and investment transactions, including potential acquisitions of other finance companies, business development companies and asset managers. Some of these transactions could be material to our business and, if completed, could be difficult to integrate, result in increased leverage or dilution and/or subject us to unexpected liabilities. However, none of these discussions has progressed to the point at which the completion of any such transaction could be deemed to be probable or reasonably certain as of the date of this Annual Report. Completion of any such transaction would be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors, any required third party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our stockholders. We cannot predict how quickly the terms of any such transaction could be finalized, if at all. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such transaction would be completed. In connection with evaluating potential strategic acquisition and investment transactions, we may incur significant expenses for the evaluation and due diligence investigation of these potential transactions.
ON-GOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH AND MONITORING OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
We closely monitor each investment we make, maintain a regular dialogue with both the management team and other stakeholders and seek specifically tailored financial reporting. In addition, senior investment professionals may take board seats or obtain board observation rights in connection with our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2021, of our 387 portfolio companies, we were entitled to board seats or board observation rights on 22% of these companies and these companies represented approximately 33% of our portfolio at fair value.
In addition to covenants and other contractual rights and through board participation, when appropriate, we seek to enhance portfolio company performance post-investment by actively working with management on strategic and operating initiatives where there is an opportunity to do so. We often introduce managers of companies in which we have invested to other portfolio companies to capitalize on complementary business activities and best practices.
We believe that our focus on generating proprietary deal flow gives us greater control over capital structure and investment terms and lead investing enhances our ability to closely monitor each investment we make.

Our investment adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. The following is a description of each investment grade:

Investment grade | Description 
4 | Involves the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 
3 | Involves a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. 
2 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. For investments graded 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
1 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.

As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average grade of our portfolio at fair value was 3.1. For more information on our portfolio investment grades, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio and Investment Activity.”
MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE
As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Ares Operations may provide all or a portion of this assistance pursuant to our administration agreement, the costs of which will be reimbursed by us. We may receive fees for these services.
COMPETITION
Our primary competitors include public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, other BDCs and private equity funds, each of which we compete with for financing opportunities. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider more investments and establish more relationships than we do. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act imposes on us as a BDC. For more information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.”
We believe that the relationships of the members of our investment adviser’s investment committee and of the partners of Ares enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. We believe that Ares’ professionals’ deep and long-standing direct sponsor relationships and the resulting proprietary transaction opportunities that these relationships often present, provide valuable insight and access to transactions and information. We use the industry information of Ares’ investment professionals to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies.

STAFFING
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees or affiliates of our investment adviser, Ares Capital Management, and our administrator, Ares Operations, each of which is a subsidiary of Ares Management, pursuant to the terms of our investment advisory and management agreement and our administration agreement, respectively, each as described below. Each of our executive officers is an employee or affiliate of our investment adviser or our administrator. Our day-to-day investment activities are managed by our investment adviser. Most of the services necessary for the origination of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by Ares Capital Management. Ares Capital Management had approximately 145 U.S.-based investment professionals as of December 31, 2021 who focus on origination, transaction development, investment and the ongoing monitoring of our investments. See “Investment Advisory and Management Agreement” below. We reimburse both our investment adviser and our administrator for a certain portion of expenses incurred in connection with such staffing, as described in more detail below. Because we have no employees, Ares Capital does not have a formal employee relations policy.
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 
Management Services
Ares Capital Management serves as our investment adviser and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, our investment adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to, Ares Capital. Under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement, our investment adviser:
•determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
•identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);
•closes and monitors the investments we make;
•determines the investments and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell; and
•provides us with such other investment advisory and research and related services as we may from time to time reasonably require.
Ares Capital Management’s services to us under the investment advisory and management agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities. Similarly, our investment adviser or its affiliates may directly or indirectly manage funds or other investment vehicles with investment objectives similar to ours. Accordingly, we may compete with these Ares funds or other investment vehicles managed by our investment adviser and its affiliates for capital and investment opportunities. Ares Capital Management endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, and in any event consistent with any fiduciary duties owed to Ares Capital. Nevertheless, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds or other investment vehicles managed by our investment adviser or its affiliates. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could impact our investment returns.”
Base Management Fee
Pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement and subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, our investment adviser provides investment advisory and management services to us. For providing these services, our investment adviser receives fees from us consisting of a base management fee, an income based fee and a capital gains incentive fee.
Effective June 21, 2019, in connection with our board of directors’ approval of the modification of the asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities from 200% to 150%, the investment advisory and management agreement was amended to reduce our annual base management fee rate from 1.5% to 1.0% on all assets financed using leverage over 1.0x debt to equity. For all assets financed using leverage up to 1.0x debt to equity, the annual base management fee rate remains at 1.5%. The base management fee is based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but 
15


including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and is calculated by applying the applicable fee rate. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. 
Income Based Fee 
The income based fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the income based fee and capital gains incentive fee accrued under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities, accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Our investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the income based fees it received that were based on accrued interest that we never actually received. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could impact our investment returns” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may be obligated to pay our investment adviser certain fees even if we incur a loss.”
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation, unrealized capital depreciation or income tax expense related to realized gains and losses. Because of the structure of the income based fee, it is possible that we may pay such fees in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate for a quarter, we will pay the applicable income based fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses.
Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter. If market credit spreads rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which may increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for our investment adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an income based fee based on such net investment income. To the extent we have retained pre-incentive fee net investment income that has been used to calculate the income based fee, it is also included in the amount of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) used to calculate the base management fee.
We pay our investment adviser an income based fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
•No income based fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate;
•100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%) as the “catch-up” provision. The “catch-up” is meant to provide our investment adviser with 20% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeded 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and
•20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income based fee: 
Quarterly Income Based Fee Based on Net Investment Income

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)

These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter.

Capital Gains Incentive Fee
The capital gains incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or, upon termination of our investment advisory and management agreement, as of the termination date) and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (a) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (b) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from October 8, 2004, (the date we completed our IPO). Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments and foreign currencies, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and from other assets, as well as any income tax and other expenses related to cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses. If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no capital gains incentive fee for such year.
The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable capital gains incentive fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are required by GAAP to record an investment at its fair value as of the time of acquisition instead of at the actual amount paid for such investment by us (including, for example, as a result of the application of the asset acquisition method of accounting), then solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the “accreted or amortized cost basis” of an investment shall be an amount (the “Contractual Cost Basis”) equal to (1) (x) the actual amount paid by us for such investment plus (y) any amounts recorded in our financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the accretion of such investment plus (z) any other adjustments made to the cost basis included in our financial statements, including PIK interest or additional amounts funded (net of repayments) minus (2) any amounts recorded in our financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the amortization of such investment, whether such calculated Contractual Cost Basis is higher or lower than the fair value of such investment (as determined in accordance with GAAP) at the time of acquisition.
We defer cash payment of any income based fee and the capital gains incentive fee otherwise earned by our investment adviser if during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. Any deferred income based fees and capital gains incentive fees are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment is payable under our investment advisory and management agreement.
17


Payment of Our Expenses
The services of all investment professionals and staff of our investment adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by our investment adviser. Under the investment advisory and management agreement, we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, but not limited to, those relating to: organization; calculation of our net asset value (including, but not limited to, the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); expenses incurred by our investment adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments (including the cost of consultants hired to develop information technology systems designed to monitor our investments) and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; interest payable on indebtedness, if any, incurred to finance our investments (including payments to third party vendors for financial information services); cost of rating agencies; offerings of our common stock and other securities; investment advisory and management fees; administration fees; fees payable to third parties, including agents, attorneys, consultants or other advisers, relating to, or associated with, evaluating, negotiating with and making investments in portfolio companies, regardless of whether such transactions are ultimately consummated; transfer agent and custodial fees; registration fees; listing fees; taxes; independent directors’ fees and expenses; costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; to the extent we are covered by any joint insurance policies, our allocable portion of the insurance premiums for such policies; direct costs and expenses of administration, including auditor and legal costs; and all other expenses incurred by us or our administrator in connection with administering our business as described in more detail under “—Administration Agreement” below.
Duration, Termination and Amendment
At a meeting of our board of directors on May 26, 2021, our board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not “interested persons” of the Company as defined in the Investment Company Act, voted to approve the continuation of our investment advisory and management agreement, which extended the terms of the agreement until June 6, 2022. Such meeting was held via videoconference pursuant to the exemptive relief granted under SEC Release No. 33897, dated June 19, 2020. Our board of directors ratified the approval of the continuation of our investment advisory and management agreement during an in-person meeting on October 21, 2021. See “Regulation.”
Unless terminated earlier, our investment advisory and management agreement will renew for successive annual periods if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons” of the Company (as defined in the Investment Company Act). Our investment advisory and management agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act). The investment advisory and management agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
In voting to approve the investment advisory and management agreement, our independent directors consulted in executive session with their independent legal counsel regarding the approval of such agreement. In reaching a decision to approve the investment advisory and management agreement, our board of directors reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things:
(i)    the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Company by our investment adviser;
(ii)    the advisory fees paid by the Company under the investment advisory and management agreement as compared to the advisory fees paid by other funds and accounts managed by our investment adviser with similar investment strategies as well as the fees and expenses of comparable BDCs; 
(iii)    the long- and short-term investment performance of the Company and our investment adviser;
(iv)    the costs of the services provided by our investment adviser (including the base management fee, the income based fee and the capital gains incentive fee (including the applicable hurdle rates and conditions for the deferral of fee payments) and expense ratios) under the investment advisory and management agreement and comparative data based on publicly available information;
(v)    the potential for, and sharing of, economies of scale in investment management given the directly originated nature of the Company’s investment portfolio and resources dedicated by our investment adviser thereto;
18


(vi)    our investment adviser’s pro forma profitability with respect to managing the Company based on financial information provided by our investment adviser;
(vii)    additional benefits to be derived by our investment adviser and its affiliates as a result of our relationship with our investment adviser; and
(viii)    various other matters, including the alignment of interests of our stockholders.
In voting to approve the investment advisory and management agreement, our board of directors, including all of the directors who are not “interested persons,” of the Company, made the following conclusions:
•Nature, Extent and Quality of Services. Our board of directors considered the nature, extent and quality of the investment selection process employed by our investment adviser, including the flow of transaction opportunities resulting from Ares Capital Management’s investment professionals’ significant capital markets, trading and research expertise, the employment of Ares Capital Management’s investment philosophy, diligence procedures, credit recommendation process, investment structuring, and ongoing relationships with and monitoring of portfolio companies, in light of the investment objective of the Company. Our board of directors also considered our investment adviser’s personnel and their prior experience in connection with the types of investments made by us, including such personnel’s network of relationships with intermediaries focused on U.S. middle-market companies and other companies in which we may make investments. Our board of directors also considered the benefit and increasing costs of our investment adviser continuing to be able to recruit and retain top talent. In addition, our board of directors considered the other terms and conditions of the investment advisory and management agreement, including that the substantive terms of the investment advisory and management agreement (other than the fees payable thereunder, which our board of directors reviewed separately) are generally the same as those of comparable BDCs described in the available market data and that it would be difficult to obtain similar services of similar quality on a comparable basis from other third party service providers or through an internally managed structure. In addition, our board of directors considered the fact that we have the ability to terminate the investment advisory and management agreement without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to our investment adviser. Our board of directors further determined that our investment adviser is served by a dedicated origination, transaction development and investment team of investment professionals, and that these investment professionals have historically focused on investments in U.S. middle-market companies and other companies in which we may make investments, which experience and relationships coincide with our investment objective and generally equal or exceed those of the management teams or investment advisers of other comparable BDCs described in the available market data.
•Investment Performance. Our board of directors reviewed the long-term and short-term investment performance of the Company and our investment adviser, as well as comparative data based on publicly available information with respect to the long-term and short-term investment performance of other externally managed BDCs and their investment advisers. Our board of directors noted the longevity and consistency of the Company’s investment performance and determined that our investment adviser was delivering results consistent with the investment objective of the Company and that the Company’s investment performance was generally above average when compared to comparable BDCs, including based on one, three and five year time periods. Our board of directors further determined that in light of the performance history of the Company, our investment adviser’s extensive experience with our particular investment objectives and policies and our investment adviser’s commitment to the Company, our investment adviser was well-positioned to manage our investment performance, including through the volatile market conditions caused by the novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, with the approval of the investment advisory and management agreement.
•Costs of the Services Provided to the Company. Our board of directors considered (i) comparative data based on publicly available information with respect to services rendered and the advisory fees (including the base management fee, income based fee and capital gains incentive fee or similar fees (including applicable hurdle rates, other payment conditions and/or fee waivers)) of other BDCs with similar investment objectives, our operating expenses and expense ratios compared to other BDCs of similar size and with similar investment objectives and (ii) the administrative services that our administrator will provide to us at cost. Further, our board of directors considered comparative information with respect to the advisory fees paid by the Company as compared to the advisory fees paid by other funds and accounts managed by our investment adviser with similar investment strategies, and considered the rationale for the differences in fees, including, but not limited to, differences in investment objectives and investment strategies as well as the regulated nature of the Company. 
19


•Economies of Scale. Our board of directors considered information about the potential for our stockholders to experience economies of scale as we grow in size. 
In view of the wide variety of material factors that our board of directors considered in connection with its evaluation of the investment advisory and management agreement, it is not practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. Our board of directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of our board of directors. Rather, our board of directors based its approval on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted by, it. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
Based on the information reviewed and the factors discussed above, our directors (including those directors who are not “interested persons” of the Company) concluded that the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement, including the fee rates thereunder, are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the investment advisory and management agreement as being in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Conflicts of interest may arise if our investment adviser seeks to change the terms of our investment advisory and management agreement, including, for example, the amount of the base management fee, the income based fee, the capital gains incentive fee or other compensation terms. Material amendments to our investment advisory and management agreement must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and by a majority of our independent directors, and we may from time to time decide it is appropriate to seek the requisite approval to change the terms of the agreement.
Indemnification
The investment advisory and management agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our investment adviser, its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members and any other persons affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our investment adviser’s services under the investment advisory and management agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.

Our investment adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal executive offices of Ares Capital Management are located at 2000 Avenue of the Stars, 12th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90067.
ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT
We are also party to an administration agreement, referred to herein as the “administration agreement”, with our administrator, Ares Operations. Our board of directors approved the continuation of our administration agreement on May 26, 2021, which extended the term of the agreement until June 1, 2022. Pursuant to the administration agreement, Ares Operations furnishes us with office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at our office facilities. Under the administration agreement, Ares Operations also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Ares Operations assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, assists us in providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of Ares Operations’ overhead and other expenses (including travel expenses) incurred by Ares Operations in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of certain of our officers (including our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, general counsel, secretary, treasurer and assistant treasurer) and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
20


For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $15 million and $13 million, respectively, in administrative fees. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $4 million and $3 million, respectively, of the administrative fees were unpaid and included in “accounts payable and other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Indemnification
The administration agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Ares Operations, its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members and any other persons or entities affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Ares Operations’ services under the administration agreement or otherwise as our administrator.
LICENSE AGREEMENT
Ares Management LLC, the sole member of Ares Capital Management, has granted us a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to use the name “Ares” pursuant to a license agreement. Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the Ares name for so long as Ares Capital Management remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Ares” name.
LEVERAGE
We may from time to time borrow funds to make investments, a practice known as “leverage,” to attempt to increase returns to our stockholders. With certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as calculated in accordance with the Investment Company Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowing (i.e., we are able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us).
The amount of leverage that we employ at any particular time will depend on our investment adviser’s and our board of directors’ assessments of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As of February 2, 2022, we had $10.6 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under the various debt instruments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing with us.” For more information on our debt, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” as well as Note 5 and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
REGULATION 
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to certain transactions between BDCs and certain affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and certain affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. Among other things, we generally cannot co-invest in any portfolio company in which a fund managed by Ares or any of its downstream affiliates other than us and our downstream affiliates) is also co-investing. On January 18, 2017, we received the Co-investment Exemptive Order from the SEC that permits us and other business development companies and registered closed-end management investment companies managed by Ares to co-invest in portfolio companies with each other and with affiliated investment funds. Co-investments made under the Co-investment Exemptive Order are subject to compliance with certain conditions and other requirements contained in the Co-investment Exemptive Order, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. In addition, we are relying on the Exemptive Relief that permits a BDC with an effective Co-investment Exemptive Order to allow an affiliated investment fund to participate in a follow-on investment in a portfolio company where such affiliated investment fund is not already invested. Although this relief expired on December 31, 2020, on January 5, 2021, the SEC stated that, until March 31, 2022, it will not recommend enforcement action against any BDC with an existing co-investment order that relies on the Exemptive Relief. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Ares or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with existing 
21


regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. There can be no guarantee that the Co-investment Exemptive Order will be further extended.
The Investment Company Act contains certain restrictions on certain types of investments we may make. Specifically, we may only invest up to 30% of our portfolio in entities that are not considered “eligible portfolio companies” (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.
The Investment Company Act also requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, referred to herein as “independent directors.” In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless that change is approved by holders of at least a majority of our outstanding voting securities. Under the Investment Company Act, the vote of holders of at least a “majority of outstanding voting securities” means the vote of the holders of the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock present at a meeting or represented by proxy if holders of more than 50% of the shares of our common stock are present or represented by proxy or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
Under the Investment Company Act, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value per share of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. Pursuant to approval granted at a special meeting of stockholders held on August 13, 2021, we currently are permitted to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value, subject to certain limitations and determinations that must be made by our board of directors. Such stockholder approval expires on August 13, 2022.
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants or options to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financings or other investments. In connection with such an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances.
We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company (as defined in the Investment Company Act), invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate unless certain conditions are met. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses.
We are currently allowed to borrow amounts or issue debt securities or preferred stock, which we refer to collectively as “senior securities,” such that our asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, equals at least 150% immediately after such borrowing (i.e., we are able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us).
