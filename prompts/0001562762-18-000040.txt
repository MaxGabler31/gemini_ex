ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

  MercadoLibre, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries “us”, “we”, “our” or the “Company”) is one of the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America. Our platform is designed to provide users with a complete portfolio of services to facilitate commercial transactions. We are a market leader in e-commerce in each of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, based on number of unique visitors and page views. We also operate online commerce platforms in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala, Paraguay and Portugal.
 Through our platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust environment that fosters the development of a large e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 635 million people and one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. We believe that we offer technological and commercial solutions that address the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America.
 We offer our users an ecosystem of six integrated e-commerce services: the MercadoLibre Marketplace, the MercadoLibre Classifieds Service, the MercadoPago payments solution, the MercadoLibre advertising program, the MercadoShops online webstores solution and the MercadoEnvios shipping service.
 The MercadoLibre Marketplace, which we sometimes refer to as our marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce service. This service permits both businesses and individuals to list merchandise and conduct sales and purchases online in either a fixed-price or auction-based format. 
 To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution. MercadoPago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off our marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments online. Mercado Pago is currently available in: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay and Perú. MercadoPago allows merchants to facilitate checkout and payment processes on their websites and also enables users to simply transfer money to each other either through the website or using the MercadoPago App, available on iOS and Android. Additionally, we launched MercadoCredito, which is designed to extend loans to specific merchants and consumers. Our MercadoCredito solution allows us to deepen our engagement with our merchants, in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and consumers in Argentina, by offering them additional services and is currently available. 
 To further enhance our suite of e-commerce services, we launched the MercadoEnvios shipping program in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. Through MercadoEnvios, we arrange for third-party shipping providers to fulfill their sales. Sellers opting into the program are able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers at competitive prices. As of December 31, 2017 we also offer free shipping to buyers in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.
 Through MercadoLibre Classifieds Service, our online classified listing service, our users can also list and purchase motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services in all countries where we operate. Classifieds listings differ from Marketplace listings as they only charge optional placement fees and never final value fees. Our classifieds pages are also a major source of traffic to our website, benefitting both the Marketplace and non-marketplace businesses.
 To enhance the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed our MercadoLibre advertising program, to enable businesses to promote their products and services on the Internet. Through our advertising program, MercadoLibre’s sellers and large advertisers are able to display ads on our webpages and our associated vertical sites in the region.
 Additionally, through MercadoShops, our online store solution, users can set-up, manage and promote their own online store. These stores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the other marketplace, payment and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free store or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and value added services on their store.
 MercadoLibre also develops and sells enterprise software solutions to e-commerce business clients in Brazil.
 As further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, effective as of December 1, 2017, we determined that we no longer meet the accounting criteria for control of our subsidiaries in Venezuela as a result of Venezuela’s recent selective default determination, restrictive exchange controls, suspension of foreign exchange market and the worsening in Venezuela macroeconomic environment that have significantly impacted the Company’s ability to make key financial decisions with respect to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As a result, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of December 1, 2017, recorded an impairment of its investments in Venezuela, including net assets, intercompany balances and intangible assets and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting. As of December 1, 2017, the Company no longer includes the balances, results of operations and cash flows of the Venezuelan subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements.

History of MercadoLibre
 In March 1999, Marcos Galperin, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, wrote our business plan while working towards his master’s degree in business administration at Stanford Business School. Shortly thereafter, he began to assemble a team of professionals to implement it. We were incorporated in Delaware in October 1999.
 We commenced operations in Argentina in August 1999 and subsequently began operations in other countries as well. Since our inception, we have grown both organically and through selective acquisitions. The following table shows the timeline of different launches and events in each country:
 ﻿

  ﻿
 Our business is on the same technological platform in each of our operating countries. However, each country has its own standalone website on the MercadoLibre platform. For example, searches carried out on our Brazilian website show only results of listings uploaded to our Brazilian website and do not show listings from other MercadoLibre webpages.
 In 2001, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) became one of our stockholders and started working with us to better serve the Latin American e-commerce community. From 2001 to 2006, we had a strategic alliance with eBay. During this term, this agreement also provided us with access to certain know-how and experience, which accelerated aspects of our development. Since the termination of this agreement, there are no contractual restrictions preventing eBay from becoming one of our competitors. On October 13, 2016, eBay sold its shares in our company. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We operate in a highly competitive and evolving market, and therefore face potential reductions in the use of our service.”
 We completed our initial public offering in August 2007, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $49.6 million.
 We have grown in part through certain acquisitions since our inception, including of certain operations of DeRemate.com in 2005 and, more recently, Inmobiliaria Web, Business Vision S.A., KPL Soluções Ltda and Metros Cúbicos, S.A. de C.V. 
 In February 2016, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Monits S.A., a software development company located and organized under the laws of Buenos Aires, Argentina, for the purchase price of $3.1 million. The objective of this acquisition was to enhance our software development capabilities.
 In June 2016, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Axado, a company that develops logistic software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil, for the purchase price of $5.5 million. The objective of this acquisition was to enhance our software development capabilities on Transportation Management System and contribute to our shipping business performance.
 In December 2017, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of E-Commet Software Ltda., a Brazilian software development company, for the purchase price of $8.7 million. The objective of this acquisition was to enhance our software development capabailities.

Our strategy
 Our main focus is to serve people in Latin America by enabling wide access to retail and payments e-commerce services, providing compelling technology based solutions that democratize commerce and money, thus contributing to the development of a large and growing digital economy in a region with a population of over 635 million people and one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world.
 We serve our buyers by giving them access to a broad and affordable variety of products and services, a selection we believe to be larger than otherwise available to them via other online and offline sources serving our Latin American markets. We believe we serve our sellers by giving them access to a larger and more geographically diverse user base at a lower overall cost and investment than offline venues serving our Latin American markets. Additionally, we provide payment settlement services to facilitate such transactions, and advertising solutions to promote them. We also serve our users by making capital more accessible through different credit products, fostering entrepreneurship and social mobility, with the goal of creating significant value for our stakeholders.

More broadly, we strive to make inefficient markets more efficient through technology and in that process generate value for our stockholders. 
 To achieve these objectives, we intend to pursue the following strategies:

· | Continue to improve shopping experience for our users. We intend to continually enhance our e-commerce ecosystem in order to better serve individuals, brands, retailers and other businesses that want to buy or sell goods and services online in a convenient, simple and safe way. We are committed to continue investing to develop new tools and technologies that facilitate web and mobile commerce on our platform. Within our constant focus on innovation, a key component of user experience is the vertical solutions we offer across key categories. We will continue to focus on improving the functionality of our websites and apps, driving increased usage of our payments and shipping solutions to deliver a more efficient and safe shopping experience and providing our users with the help of a dedicated customer support department. We will continue to focus on increasing purchase frequency and transaction volumes from our existing users, including the development of our MercadoLider loyalty program for high-volume sellers, and our MercadoPuntos loyalty program for frequent buyers.

· | Continue to grow our business and maintain market leadership. We have focused and intend to continue to focus on growing our business and achieving as many scale related competitive advantages by focusing on top line growth and strengthening our position as a preferred commerce and payments platform in each of the markets in which we operate. We also intend to grow our business and maintain our leadership by taking advantage of the expanding potential user base that has resulted from the growth of Internet penetration rates in Latin America. We intend to achieve these goals through organic growth, by introducing our business in new countries and entering new category segments, by launching new transactional business lines, and through potential strategic acquisitions of key businesses and assets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand into additional transactional service offerings. Our strategic focus is to enable online transactions of multiple types of goods and services throughout Latin America. Consequently, we strive, and will continue to strive, to launch online transactional offerings in new product and service categories where we believe business opportunities exist. These new transactional offerings include, but are not limited to, efforts involving: (a) offering additional product categories in our marketplace, (b) expanding our presence in vehicle, real estate and services classifieds, (c) maximizing utilization of MercadoPago on our platform and expanding off-platform in online and offline transactions, (d) maximizing utilization of MercadoEnvios, (e) expanding our MercadoCrédito service, (f) offering enterprise software solutions to our online commerce business clients and (g) expanding our advertising offerings. We believe that a significant portion of our growth will be derived from these new or expanded product and service launches in the future.

· | Increase monetization of our transactions. We have focused and will continue to focus on improving the revenue generation capacity of our business by implementing initiatives designed to maximize the revenues we receive from transactions on our platform. Some of these initiatives include increasing our fee structure, selling advertising on our platform, offering other e-commerce services and expanding our fee-based features.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Take advantage of the natural synergies that exist between our services. We strive to leverage our different businesses to promote greater cross-usage, thereby creating a fully integrated ecosystem of e-commerce offerings. We promote the adoption of our MercadoPago payments solution on our marketplace as well as on our MercadoShops solution, offer our advertising solutions to users of our marketplace, payments and shops solutions, and encourage users of any of our services to experiment with the other solutions we offer.

MercadoLibre Marketplace
 The MercadoLibre Marketplace is an online commerce platform where buyers and sellers can engage in transactions for a wide range of goods and services. We believe that the MercadoLibre Marketplace allows sellers to reach a large consumer audience more cost-effectively than through traditional offline commerce channels or other online venues serving our Latin American markets. Our platform is a fully-automated, topically- arranged and user-friendly online commerce service which permits both businesses and individuals to list items and conduct their sales and purchases online. Any Internet user can browse through the various products and services that are listed on our website and register for free with MercadoLibre to list or purchase items and services. Additionally, sellers and advertisers can purchase, display and link advertising on our websites to promote their brands, businesses and products. The MercadoLibre Marketplace offers buyers a large selection of new and used items that we believe are often more expensive or otherwise hard to find through traditional offline sellers, such as brick-and-mortar retail establishments, offline classified advertisements, community bulletin boards, auction houses and flea markets.
 Our MercadoLibre Marketplace is on the same technological platform in each of our operating countries. However, each country has it own standalone website on the MercadoLibre platform. For example, searches carried out on our Brazilian site show only results of listings uploaded on our Brazilian site and do not show listings from other MercadoLibre webpages.
 During 2017, visitors to our website were able to browse over 114.2 million Marketplace listings daily, organized by country, in over 1,461 different product categories. We believe that we have achieved a critical mass of active buyers, sellers and product listings in most of the countries where we operate and that our business can be readily scaled to handle increases in our user base and transaction volume. At December 31, 2017, we had over 211.9 million confirmed registered MercadoLibre Marketplace users, up from 174.2 million and 144.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2017, in our Marketplace, we had 10.1 million unique sellers, 33.7 million unique buyers and 270.1 million Successful Items sold as compared to i) 7.6 million unique sellers, 27.7 million unique buyers and 181.2 million successful items sold during 2016 and ii) 6.2 million unique sellers, 23.6 million unique buyers and 128.4 million successful items sold during 2015. Finally, our Marketplace gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) was $11.7 billion in 2017, as compared to $8.0 billion in 2016 and $7.2 billion in 2015. See Item 6 of Part II, “Selected Financial Data-Other data” for details on the measures described in this paragraph.
 Additionally, during 2017, we launched a loyalty program called “Mercado Puntos” in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. This program allows buyers to accumulate points for each purchase made on our platform, and grants access to certain benefits as buyers advance through levels. Currently, the benefit consists of free shipping services for future purchases. 
 MercadoLibre Classifieds Service
 The MercadoLibre Classifieds Service enables users to list their offerings related to motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services outside the Marketplace platform. Classifieds listings differ from Marketplace listings, as they only charge optional placement fees, and never final value fees. Our classifieds pages are also a major source of traffic to our website, benefitting both Marketplace and non-Marketplace businesses.
 In 2017, MercadoLibre visitors were able to browse an average of 4.0 million classifieds listings daily, including 3.1 million in Real Estate, 0.8 million in motors, and 0.1 million in services per day. During 2017, we had a total of 4.7 million unique sellers and 28.9 million paid listings through the MercadoLibre Classifieds Service, as compared to i) 2.9 million unique sellers and 27.2 million paid listings during 2016 and ii) 2.4 million unique sellers and 15.2 million paid listings during 2015.
 MercadoPago Payments Service
 To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution. MercadoPago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments online. MercadoPago enables any MercadoLibre registered user to securely and easily send and receive payments online to pay for purchases made in the MercadoLibre Marketplace. MercadoPago is currently available to MercadoLibre users in each of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Perú and Uruguay.
 MercadoPago is also available in these countries for purchases of goods and services outside the MercadoLibre Marketplace, as an open online payment service. The off platform service is designed to meet the growing demand for Internet-based payments systems in Latin America. Users are able to transfer money to other users and to incorporate MercadoPago as a means of payment on their independent websites. MercadoPago allows merchants to facilitate checkout and payment processes on their websites and also enables users to simply transfer money to each other either through the website or using the MercadoPago App, available on iOS, Android and other mobile operating systems. MercadoPago allows merchants who are not registered with the MercadoLibre Marketplace to receive payments as long as they registered with MercadoPago. It also allows consumers to pay MercadoPago-registered merchants either by registering with MercadoPago or by providing their credit card information as a “guest user”.

Furthermore, MercadoPago offers registered online sellers the ability to integrate MercadoPago with their checkout flow, thereby streamlining the shopping and payment processes. We believe that the ease of use, safety and efficiency of MercadoPago will allow us to generate additional transactions in the future from web merchants that sell items outside the MercadoLibre Marketplace. We believe that there is a significant business opportunity to increase adoption of MercadoPago as a payment mechanism both on and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace for years to come.
 In July 2015, MercadoPago launched a mobile point of sale service in Brazil that allows merchants or individuals to process physical credit and debit cards, either by reading the chip and entering the personal identification number, or PIN, of the card or by swiping it, depending on the type of card. This service was also launched in Mexico and Argentina in 2016.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, our on-platform users spent $9,628 million using MercadoPago, which represented 81.9% of our gross merchandise volume for that year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our on-platform users spent $5,627 million using MercadoPago, which represented 69.9% of our gross merchandise volume for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our on-platform users spent approximately $3,765 million using MercadoPago, which represented 52.6% of our gross merchandise volume for that year.
 We seek to increase the adoption and penetration of MercadoPago among MercadoLibre Marketplace users. In the countries where MercadoPago was available, as of December 31, 2017, approximately 99.8% of the MercadoLibre Marketplace listings accepted MercadoPago for payments and 93.2% of our total GMV in these countries was processed through MercadoPago. Starting in Brazil in January 2010, in Argentina in March 2010, in Mexico in April 2011, in Venezuela in July 2012, in Colombia in November 2013, in Perú in June in 2016 and in Uruguay in November 2016, all paid listings on the MercadoLibre Marketplace (excluding free listings and classifieds) were required to offer MercadoPago.
 Finally, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we launched MercadoCredito in Argentina, which is designed to extend loans to specific merchants and consumers. During 2017, MercadoCredito also launched in Brazil and Mexico. Our MercadoCredito solution allows us to deepen our engagement with our merchants, in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and consumers in Argentina, by offering them additional services. As of December 31, 2017, we extended approximately $127.5 million in credit to merchants and consumers, of which $73.4 million were outstanding.
 MercadoEnvios Shipping Service
 MercadoEnvios is a shipping service for marketplace users, available in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. Through MercadoEnvios, we offer a cost-efficient integration with third-party logistic and shipping carriers to sellers on our platform. Sellers opting into the program are able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers at competitive prices.    MercadoLibre Advertising Service
 The MercadoLibre Advertising platform enables large retailers and various other consumer brands to promote their products and services on the Internet by providing branding and performance marketing services. Advertisers place text, display or banner advertisements in order to promote their brands and offerings on our webpages and our associated sites in the region. Advertisers can purchase improved search standing and/or specific categories, on a cost per click basis or per impression basis, where their advertisements could appear as a result of a bidding process with other relevant advertisements.    MercadoShops Webstores Service
 MercadoShops is a software-as-a-service, fully hosted online store solution. Through MercadoShops users can set-up, manage and promote  their own webstores. These webstores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the other marketplace, payment and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and added services on their webstores.
 Marketing
 Our marketing strategy is designed to grow our platform by promoting the Mercado Libre brand, attracting new users and generating more frequent trading by our existing users. To this end, we employ various means of advertising, including placement in leading online channels across Latin America, paid and organic positioning in leading search engines, email marketing, onsite marketing and presence in offline events. Our expenditures in marketing activities were $175.2 million during 2017, $72.0 million during 2016 and $58.5 million during 2015.
 Specifically, we rely mostly on online advertising to promote our brand and attract potential buyers and sellers to our websites. To summarize, we focus on the following key marketing initiatives:

· | Search: Mercado Libre advertises on the top search engines in each of our key markets. Our investment is focused on obtaining a position that allows our ads to maximize the number of views, and clicks from our intended target audience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Display: Mercado Libre is an active participant in the main display-ad networks across the region. These networks include, but are not limited to Google Display Network and Facebook. Our company uses the display networks to run branding, prospecting and retargeting strategies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Email and Push Notifications: We use our user base to target ad-hoc advertisements designed as a retargeting tool as well as to push key selling events throughout the year.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On-site: We use our own platform's real estate to promote key selling events as well as always-on actions designed to showcase certain categories and or selected items.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offline: When appropriate, we promote key selling events on radio and TV. In addition, we organize public relation events to promote our brand and reputation where we see opportunities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  During 2017, we continued to showcase our regional brand campaign “Never Stop Searching”. As part of these efforts, we continued to display our 8 best-performing video spots produced in 2016 that were designed for and released in digital media. We consider digital media as an important channel to reach millennials, our target market, and find it more cost-effective than TV. As a result of this branding strategy, we continue to see significant growth in direct traffic.
 In addition to our branding videos, we also ran video advertisements in Mexico, Colombia and Chile designed to improve awareness of some of the functional attributes of our product such as free shipping (for qualifying purchases), and our buyer protection program. This campaign ran mainly across digital media, but did air on TV and radio in some locations.
 Product development
 At December 31, 2017, we had 1,655 employees on our information technology and product development staff, an increase from 429 employees at December 31, 2016, due to new hires and as a consequence of improvements in our ecosystem products such as MercadoCredito, our loyalty pogram and MercadoEnvios, which increased our information technology and product development staff. We incurred product development expenses (including salaries) in the amount of $127.2 million in 2017, $98.5 million in 2016 and $76.4 million in 2015. We also incurred information technology capital expenditures, including software licenses, amounting to $51.4 million in 2017, $33.1 million in 2016 and $25.8 million in 2015.
 We continually work to improve both our MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago websites so that they better serve our users’ needs and function more efficiently. A significant portion of our information technology resources are allocated to these purposes. We strive to maintain the right balance between offering new features and enhancing the existing functionality and architecture of our software and hardware.
 The adequate management of the MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago software architecture and hardware requirements is as important as introducing additional and better features for our users. Because our business has grown relatively fast, we must ensure that our systems are capable of absorbing this incremental volume. Therefore, our engineers work to optimize our processes and equipment by designing more effective ways to run our platform.
 We develop most of our software technology in-house. Since our inception, we have had a development center in Buenos Aires where we concentrate the majority of our development efforts. In June 2007, we launched a second development center in the province of San Luis in Argentina. The center is a collaborative effort with the Technological University of La Punta. In this effort, the University offers us access to dedicated development facilities and a recruiting base for potential employees. In 2012, we opened our newest development center in Aguada Park, Montevideo, Uruguay, which is dedicated to software development activities. Since 2013, we also have a development center in the Province of Córdoba, Argentina. We also have other research and/or development centers in Brazil and Chile.
 From 2014 to 2017, we have acquired various software development companies in Argentina and Brazil that have enhanced our software development capabilities.
 While we have developed most of our software technology in-house, we have made acquisitions in the past to enhance our software development capabilities, and we outsource certain projects to outside developers. We believe that outsourcing the development of certain projects allows us to have a greater operating capacity and strengthens our internal know-how by incorporating new expertise to our business. In addition, our developers frequently interact with technology suppliers and attend technology-related events to familiarize themselves with the latest inventions and developments in the field.
 Since 2010, we have been continuously working on a deep technology overhaul to switch from a closed and monolithic system to an open and decoupled one. We are splitting MercadoLibre into many small “cells”. A cell is a functional unit with its own team, hardware, data and source code. Cells interact with each other using Application Programming Interfaces, or API´s. All the Front-Ends are also being rewritten on top of these APIs. This effort has consumed a large amount of capital, people and management’s focus, and we intend to keep investing in this area. In October 2012, we opened our platform to the developer community during a launch event in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We seek to further open our platform to developers in the other locations in which we operate, with the objective of continuing to enhance our ecosystem.

We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to our services. The market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing and disruptive technologies, evolving industry and regulatory standards, frequent new service and product announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. Accordingly, we believe the cornerstone of our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry and regulatory standards and to continually improve the performance, features, user experience and reliability of our services in response to competitive product and service offerings and evolving demands of the marketplace. 
 Seasonality
 Like most retail businesses, we experience the effects of seasonality in all our operating territories throughout the calendar year. Although much of our seasonality is due to the Christmas holiday season, the geographic diversity of our operations helps mitigate the seasonality attributed to summer vacation time (i.e. southern and northern hemispheres) and national holidays.
 Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the Christmas season (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for more detail). The first quarter of the year is generally our slowest period. The months of January, February and March correspond to summer vacation time in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Additionally, the Easter holiday falls in March or April, and Brazil celebrates Carnival for one week in February or March. This first quarter seasonality is partially mitigated by our operations in the countries located in the northern hemisphere, such as Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, the slowest months for which are the summer months of July, August and September.
 Competition
 The online commerce market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify even further in the future. Barriers-to-entry for large, established Internet companies are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at relatively low cost using commercially available software. While we are currently a market leader in a number of the markets in which we operate, we currently or potentially compete with a limited number of marketplace operators, such as Amazon and Rakuten in Brazil and Amazon in  México. We also compete with businesses that offer business-to-consumer online e-commerce services such as pure play Internet retailer Submarino (a website of B2W Inc.), Cnova, Aliexpress or others with a focus on specific vertical categories, such as Netshoes, which focuses on sports & apparel and Dafiti, which focuses on fashion.
 There are also a growing number of brick and mortar retailers that have launched online offerings such as Americanas (a website of B2W Inc), Casas Bahia, Walmart, Fravega, Garbarino and Falabella, and shopping comparison sites located throughout Latin America such as Buscape and Bondfaro. In the classified advertising market we compete with regional players such as OLX and Viva Street, and with local players such as Webmotors and Zap, which have strong positions in certain markets in which we operate.
 In addition, we face competition from a number of large online communities and services that have expertise in either developing e-commerce, facilitating online interaction, or both. Some of these competitors, such as Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft currently offer a variety of online services, and have the potential to introduce e-commerce to their large user populations. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in e-commerce, such as large newspaper or media companies, also compete in the online listing market in Latin America.
 In September 2001, we entered into a strategic alliance with eBay, which became one of our stockholders and started working with us to better serve the Latin American e-commerce community. As part of this strategic alliance, we acquired eBay’s Brazilian subsidiary at the time, iBazar, and eBay agreed not to compete with us in the region during the term of the agreement which ended on September 24, 2006. During this term, this agreement also provided us with access to certain know-how and experience, which accelerated aspects of our development. Since the termination of this agreement, there are no contractual restrictions preventing eBay from becoming one of our competitors. In October 2016, eBay sold all of its shares.
 MercadoPago competes with existing online and offline means of payment businesses, including, among others, banks and other providers of traditional means of payment, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits, international online payments services such as PayPal and Google Checkout, local online payment services such as PayU in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil and Mexico, Bcash, PagSeguro and MOIP in Brazil, and Conecta in Mexico, money remitters such as Western Union, the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin America, and offline funding alternatives such as cash deposit, money transfer services, person-to-person payment services and mobile card readers such as Todo Pago in Argentina, PagSeguro, Payleven SumUp and Izettle in Brazil and Clip, Sr. Pago, Billpocket and Izettle in Mexico. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than MercadoPago’s current rates.

Intellectual property
 We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors. We have also established non-disclosure agreements with our employees, strategic partners and some suppliers in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
 We pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in each country where we operate, in the United States and in certain other Latin American countries. Generally, we register the name “MercadoLibre,” “MercadoLivre,” “MercadoPago”, “MercadoEnvios”, “MercadoShops” and “MercadoCrédito” as well as our handshake logo, and other names and logos in each country where we operate. As part of our acquisition of certain subsidiaries of DeRemate.com Inc. (or “DeRemate”) and Classified Media Group, Inc. (or “CMG”), we acquired the trademarks of DeRemate and CMG, respectively, throughout the countries where they operated as well as certain other jurisdictions.
 We also own trademarks of Autoplaza.com.mx and Homershop.com.mx in Mexico. Additionally, we operate online classified advertisements platforms dedicated to the sale of real estate in Chile through the Portal Inmobiliario brand and in Mexico through the Metros Cúbicos brand. Additionally, during 2015, we acquired Metros Cúbicos (merged into MercadoLibre, S. de R.L. de C.V. since December 2016), company dedicated to the sale of real estate in Mexico, and KPL Soluções Ltda. (merged into Ebazar since August 2015), a company that develops ERP software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil, owners of Metros Cubicos and KPL trademarks, respectively. During 2016, we acquired Axado, a company that develops logistic software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil, owner of Axado trademark. Finally, in 2017 we acquired Ecommet Software Ltda., owner of the trademarks “Ecommet” and “Becommerce”, which is a company that develops e-commerce related software and provides consulting services related thereto in Brazil.
 We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the MercadoLibre brand, our licensees may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.
 Third party technologies
 We also rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties, such as Oracle Corp., SAP AG, Salesforce.com Inc., Microstrategy, Teradata, Juniper Networks, Amazon Web Services, Cisco Systems Inc., Arista Networks, Imperva, F5 Networks, Palo Alto Networks and Net App, the suppliers of key database technology, the operating system and specific hardware components for our services.
 Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights by allowing sellers to list certain items on MercadoLibre. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and “Item 1A. Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We could face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property and distribution rights of others and for information disseminated on the MercadoLibre Marketplace” below.

 The following table shows the number of our employees by country at December 31, 2017:

  We manage operations in the remaining countries in which we have operations remotely from our headquarters in Argentina.
 Our employees in Brazil are represented by an Information Technology Companies Labor Union in the State of São Paulo  (“Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Empresas e Cursos de Informática do Estado de São Paulo”)  and some of our employees in Argentina are represented by the Commercial Labor Union (“Sindicato de Empleados de Comercio”). Unions or local regulations in other countries could also require that employees be represented. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and we implement a variety of human resources practices, programs and policies that are designed to hire, develop, compensate and retain our employees.

We are very proud of our employees and believe that our team is one of the most important assets of our Company. We believe that our employees are among the most knowledgeable in the Latin American Internet industry, and they have developed a deep understanding of our business and e-commerce in general. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining outstanding individuals over the years. A significant portion of our personnel has been with us for several years, and we strive to obtain more talent by hiring individuals with an Internet-related background and experience. Similarly, our future success will depend on our ability to continue to attract, develop and retain capable professionals. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business— We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us.”
 Government regulation
 We are subject to a variety of laws, decrees and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in some of the countries where we operate related to e-commerce, electronic or mobile payments, data collection, data protection, privacy, information requirements for Internet providers, taxation (including value added taxes, (“VAT”) or sales tax collection obligations) obligations to provide information to certain authorities about transactions occurring on our platform or about our users, and other legislation which also applies to other companies conducting business in general. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation (including the imposition to provide certain information about transactions that occurred on our platform, or about our users), libel and defamation, obscenity, consumer protection, digital signatures and personal privacy apply to online businesses. Some of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of legal uncertainty, and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These regulations could cover a wide variety of issues, including, without limitation, online commerce, Internet service providers’ responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, electronic or mobile payments, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation (including VAT or sales tax collection obligations, obligation to provide certain information about transactions that occurred through our platform, or about our users), advertising, intellectual property rights, consumer protection and information security.
 We are also subject to regulations in Argentina that impose sales taxes and VAT collection obligations on the Company based on users’ sales through the platform. Other jurisdictions may issue new legislation in that regard. If users were to reduce or stop using our website or services as a result of these regulations, our business would be harmed.
 Since 2013, we are subject to obligations in Brazil imposed on certain payment processing functions carried out by non-financial institutions. During November 2014, we submitted our application to become an authorized payment institution in Brazil. As of the date of this report, we have not received such authorization, this is consistent with information provided by the Central Bank of Brazil indicating that the vast majority of applications submitted to date have not yet been processed. We are permitted to continue carrying out the payment processing functions subject to the authorization until such authorization is received or denied. Further, we have not received any indication that our application will not be authorized at some point.
 During 2014 and 2015, Colombia enacted regulations which established specific requirements to open accounts and provide certain payment services, as well as policies for cash and risk management. 
 Uruguay and Peru also enacted regulations that cover a wide variety of issues related to electronic payments or e-money, including, among other things, rules related to the requirement to obtain authorization from the relevant authority to operate, offer or provide certain payment services. 
 In September 2016, we obtained the registration of our Uruguayan subsidiary before the Central Bank of Uruguay as an entity entitled to provide services of payments and collections. Thus, on November 1, 2016 MercadoPago was launched in Uruguay.
 During 2017, Chile enacted regulations regarding the operation of prepaid cards which could affect MercadoPago’s operations, including authorization to operate, anti-money laundering obligations, capital and reserve fund requirements, among others.
 In 2017, Mexico’s anti-competition regulatory commission began to investigate potential monopolistic practices across the e-commerce industry in an effort to ensure compliance with the Mexican anti-competition statute. As a market leader in the e-commerce industry in Mexico, we are complying fully with any inquries from the commission. MercadoLibre has not been named or implicated individually in any way.
 In the rest of the countries in which we operate we believe that the agency-based structure that we currently use for MercadoPago allows us to operate this service without obtaining any governmental authorizations or licenses or being regulated as a financial institution in the countries where we offer MercadoPago. However, as we continue to develop MercadoPago and, particularly, our peer-to-peer lending business we may need to secure governmental authorizations or licenses or comply with regulations applicable to financial institutions, electronic or mobile payments and/or anti-money laundering in the countries where we offer this service. In this regard, since November 2016 the Argentine subsidiary of the Company is registered before the Argentine anti-money laundering authority (“Unidad de Información Financiera”) as an entity subject to certain reporting obligations pursuant to anti-money laundering local regulations.

There are laws and regulations that address foreign currency and exchange rates in every country in which we operate. In certain countries where we operate, we need governmental authorization to pay invoices to a foreign supplier or send money abroad due to foreign exchange restrictions. See “Item 1A. Risk factors—Risks related to doing business in Latin America—Local currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange controls” for more information.
 The Argentine Ministry of Economy approved our main Argentina subsidiary as beneficiary of the Argentine Regime to promote the software industry. Benefits of receiving this status include a relief of 60% of total income tax related to software development activities and a 70% relief in payroll taxes related to software development activities. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2-Summary of significant accounting policies-Income and asset taxes.”
 The Venezuelan Government issued a law in 2015 which established a maximum profit margin of 30% of the cost structure of goods or services sold by each participant in the commercialization chain. 
 In August 2016, we acquired 6,057 square meters and 50 parking spaces in an office building in process of construction located in Buenos Aires, for a total amount of $31.4 million. In connection with this acquisition, in February 2017, we obtained a preliminary approval that allows us to defer during a 2-year period payments of sales tax in the City of Buenos Aires up to the amounts disbursed for the building. These deferred payments will be extinguished (i.e. as tax reliefs) upon receiving definitive approval from the City of Buenos Aires government within that 2-year period.
