Overview of the Market
 
The cannabis market has a multi-billion dollar potential. The industry is in its infancy and is rapidly being propelled towards its potential by the state legalization and the rush by suppliers to meet the pent-up demand. Most suppliers are small unsophisticated but capable operators. The federal legal constraints provide an opportunity to those companies early to the market to gain a first mover advantage and to the successful ones, an opportunity to be a consolidator in the industry. How can a company establish itself as a prestigious national brand when federal laws prohibit the sale of these products? How can a legitimate company respect these laws and be the first mover in the retail and wholesale trade in this industry?
 
What is Diego’s Strategy, Phases One and Two?
 
Diego is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on high quality recurring revenues resulting from leasing real estate to licensed cannabis operators. Diego provides a competitive advantage to these operators by developing “Diego Pellicer” as the world’s first premium marijuana brand and by establishing the highest quality standards for its facilities and products.
 
The Company’s first phase strategy is to acquire and develop the most prominent and convenient real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed operators in the cannabis industry. Diego’s first phase revenues result from leasing real estate and selling non-cannabis related accessories to our tenants. The company has developed a brand name strategy, providing training, design services, branded accessories, systems and systems training, locational selection, and other advisory services to their tenants. We enter into branding agreements with our tenants. In addition, part of the vetting process in finding the proper tenant is selecting a tenant that shares the Company’s values and strictly complies with state laws, follows strict safety and testing requirements and provides consistent, high-quality products. If the tenants do not comply, they will not be allowed to use the brand.
 
The second phase of our strategy is to secure options to purchase the tenant’s operations when it becomes legal on a federal level to operate cannabis distribution operations. When mutually advantageous for Diego and the tenant, Diego will negotiate acquisition contracts with selected Diego operators/tenants. When it becomes federally legal to do so, Diego will execute the acquisition contracts, consolidate our selected tenants and become a nationally branded marijuana retailer and producer concurrent with the change of federal law.
 
Value Proposition
 
Value proposition 1: By providing branding, training, unique accessories, purchasing services, locational experience, standardized design, and experienced construction supervision, the tenant reduces his startup time, reduces cash drain, increases his efficiency, and builds his gross margin. Diego provides the capital for preopening lease costs and tenant improvements. This results in a turnkey retail location for the tenant. Thus, Diego’s real estate, consulting and accessory sales are positioned to deliver a premium return on our investment.
 
Value proposition 2: With each lease, Diego negotiates an acquisition contract with selected licensed tenants to acquire their operations. This contract will be executed at Diego’s option, and upon changes to federal law, introduces our second value proposition—ownership of operations in an industry that is projected to exceed $8 billion by 2018.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to build and market the brand utilizing all forms of media including traditional and digital media, social media, e-commerce, and strategic partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why We Believe this is a Winning Strategy
 
When the US and countries around the world legalize the commerce of marijuana on a national and international platform, Diego is positioning itself to be a dominate player in the marijuana marketplace. Diego will accomplish this by being a fully integrated marijuana retail operation and premium brand, capitalizing on the beautifully designed retail stores offering the finest quality products at competitive prices.
 
Most industries evolve through the same business cycle. Many small independent companies initially operate in fragmented markets in the early stages. Then there is a consolidation of the industry, with the consolidators thriving and the independent companies dwindling. The larger companies have access to cheaper capital, lower costs, better merchandising, brand name recognition, and more efficient operations. This what we offer out tenants when negotiating the lease: an agreement to acquire them when marijuana is legalized. This gives the tenant the ultimate opportunity to participate in the rapid consolidation that we believe will happen when marijuana is legalized. This consolidation will result in companies that have heretofore been unable to participate in the rapidly growing industry to be scrambling to enter the space. Diego and its tenants will already be established and consolidated. As an exit strategy, we want to position Diego to be a likely candidate for acquisition or a major player in the marketplace.
 
What we accomplished in 2017:
 
In 2017, Diego opened three Colorado facilities. With the Washington facility having opened in the latter part of 2016, Diego now had four facilities generating rent in 2017 for nearly the full year. The tenants in their first year of operation were quickly growing their sales and improving operational efficiency. Diego worked with these tenants, partially forbearing on their rent so as to allow these operators to strengthen their position and become capable of paying full rents. The properties generating rents in 2017 are as follows:
 
Table 1: Property Portfolio
 

Purpose | Size | City | State
---------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------+------
Retail (recreational and medical) | 3,300 sq. | Denver | CO 
Grow Warehouse | 18,600 sq. | Denver | CO 
Grow Warehouse | 14,800 sq. | Denver | CO 
Retail (recreational and medical) | 4,500 sq. | Seattle | WA 

 
Diego’s Washington tenant opened our first flagship store in Seattle in October 2016. The Colorado tenant opened the Diego Denver branded flagship store in February 2017. In addition, Diego’s two cultivation facilities in Denver, CO began production in late 2016.
 
Recurring lease revenues from signed agreements are amenable to forecast. Likewise, forecasting expenses of lease obligations for which Diego has signed contracts are also amenable to forecasting. As executed, by this summer Diego’s leases will be generating cash of over $120,000 monthly net of lease costs. After amortization of construction costs, gross income from leases will be over $100,000. In addition to this, there will be income from accessory sales.

Diego will continue this strategy in states where recreational or medical marijuana sales and cultivation is legal under state law. Our business model is recurring lease revenue and is entirely scalable. Our success will dependent upon continuing to raise capital for expansion, continual improvement of our business model, standardizing store design, controlling costs, and continuing to develop the brand.

What does our premium branding accomplish?
 
A very important aspect of our marketing plan is to build Diego Pellicer as a luxury brand. This not only enables us to establish a premium brand, but also to generate significant revenues from non- cannabis products.



The Company is establishing several levels of branding and will use these to appeal to the various segments of the marketplace depending upon the location, competition, legal constraints, and budget. Standard store templates are being developed, complimentary accessories selectively designed, and customer preferences and segments analyzed.
 
Our Seattle and Denver stores have been met with enthusiastic demand growing revenues quickly. This is proving the initial Diego concept.

The Industry: What is the Evidence of Rapid Growth?
 
Legalization of marijuana is a very recent movement. California was the first to legalize in 1996 when medical marijuana was approved. Even more recently, in 2012, recreational marijuana began to be legalized. The huge market is recreational marijuana. The following is the history:
Medical Marijuana Begins
 
1996: California legalized medical cannabis. (California Proposition 215)
 1996: First marijuana dispensary, Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana appears in Fairfax, California, USA.
 1998: Oregon, Alaska, and Washington legalized medical cannabis
 1999: Maine legalized medical cannabis
 2000: Hawaii, Nevada, and Colorado legalized medical cannabis. Hawaii became the first state to do so by state legislature. 2004: Montana and Vermont legalized medical cannabis.
 2007: New Mexico legalized medical cannabis.
 2008: Michigan legalized medical cannabis. Massachusetts decriminalized cannabis.
 2010: New Jersey and Arizona legalized medical cannabis. (Arizona’s proposition 203)
 2010: California decriminalizes possession to a civil infraction
 2012: Massachusetts legalized medical cannabis. (Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative)
 
Recreational Marijuana begins
 
2012: Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 years of age or older.
 2014: Minnesota and New York legalized medical
 2014: Utah legalizes CBD oil, becoming the first state to legalize a cannabis-based medicine without legalizing medical cannabis entirely.
 2014: Oklahoma legalizes trials of CBD oil.
 2014: Alaska and Oregon legalized recreational cannabis. Alaska’s law took effect on February 25, 2015. Oregon’s initiative began on July 1, 2015.
 2015: Georgia and Texas legalized CBD oil.
 2015: Louisiana legalized medical cannabis. 2015: Delaware decriminalized cannabis.
 2016: Ohio and Pennsylvania legalized medical cannabis via state legislature.
 2016: Illinois decriminalized cannabis.
 2016: California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts legalized recreational cannabis via ballot initiative.
 2016: Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas legalized medical cannabis via ballot initiative.

Support for medical and recreational marijuana use has increased significantly over the past 20 years. According to a recent CNN poll, greater than 50% of the US population supports marijuana legalization. Figure 1 illustrates a select set of CNN poll results.

The US state-sanctioned medical and recreational marijuana market generated a total revenue of $5.4 billion in 2015, boosted by an incredible growth in the recreational sector of sales, from $351M to $998M, an estimated increase of 184% over 2014. By comparison, the marijuana market is less than 3% of the US tobacco market, a $144 billion market that has no medicinal value, and less than 3% of the alcohol market, which valued at $113.5 billion in 2014 3.
 
Legalization resulted in rapid revenue growth in the U.S. Recreational is the big growth market. The marijuana secondary and tertiary markets have not yet been analyzed as sources of revenue; however, emerging secondary markets such as marijuana tourism could become a significant source of income for recreational legal states. As a point of comparison, Holland earns $48.55 billion per year in tourist dollars. Of the 10 million tourists, 5.5 million or 55% of tourists visit bars and marijuana cafes, generating a total of nearly $27 billion and 220,000 jobs. 4 This equals roughly 30% of all business revenue generated in Washington State in 2012.5
 
Marijuana has become a major issue in state elections as voters are seeking politicians that support legalization.6 As states legalize marijuana, and international markets develop, the emerging legalized marijuana industry will begin to rival that of tobacco and alcohol. Table 1 summarizes 2016 estimated revenues generated by marijuana retail sales based on a number of sources, including state marijuana program reports.

Where are the Greatest Market Opportunities?
 
Market distribution can be measured indirectly with registered medical consumers and dispensaries. As expected, California has the largest number of marijuana patients at more than 775,000, followed by Michigan at 344,000 and Colorado with 107,000. Washington is at 125,000 registered patients as listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 3. There are currently an estimated 1.5 million medical marijuana patients in the US.
Table 2: Registered Medical Marijuana Patients 20158



State | Registered Patients |

Arizona | $ | 87,733 
California | | 775,000

Washington | | 125,000 
Estimated Total Patients | $ | 1,508,594

Another indirect measure of market distribution is the number of medical marijuana dispensaries. Table 3 provides the distribution of dispensaries across the US.
 
Table 3: Registered Medical Marijuana Dispensaries 9
 

State | Registered Dispensaries | 
---------------------------------+-----------------------------+------
Alaska | | 0 
Arizona | | 98 
California | | 2,000
Colorado | | 516 
Connecticut | | 6 
DC | | 5 
Delaware | | 1 
Hawaii | | 0 
Illinois | | 28 
Maine | | 8 
Massachusetts | | 4 
Michigan | | 325 
Montana | | 60 
New Hampshire | | 4 
New Jersey | | 5 
New Mexico | | 29 
Nevada | | 12 
Oregon | | 400 
Rhode Island | | 3 
Vermont | | 4 
Washington | | 800 
Estimated Total Dispensaries | | 4,308

 
Although this is a good indicator of demand but it is limited as a predictor because of current legal constraints. In our estimation, the most important indicator of future demand for cannabis is the population in various states that have recently legalized recreational cannabis. This is Diego’s conclusion. We are therefore targeting California, Florida, and Nevada.

What Benchmarks could Diego be Measured Against?
 
Diego was one of the first to the market with a real estate holding and branding business model; however, other companies have since adopted similar strategies. Key differentiators between Diego and its competitors are superior branding, optimized build-out and turnkey grow and retail development, and, most importantly, pre-negotiated acquisition contracts. Table 4 provides a financial benchmark of other cannabis.

Status of Federal Law
 
While marijuana is legal under the laws of several U.S. States, at the present time the concept of “medical marijuana” and “retail marijuana” do not exist under U.S. federal law. The United States Federal Controlled Substance Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug. As defined under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision.
 
The United States Supreme Court has ruled in several cases that the federal government does not violate the federal constitution by regulating and criminalizing cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalizes its use for medicinal and recreational purposes.
 
In a memorandum dated August 29, 2013, addressed to “All United States Attorneys” from James M. Cole, Deputy Attorney General (“Cole Memo”), the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged that certain U.S. States had enacted laws relating to the use of marijuana and outlined the U.S. federal government’s enforcement priorities with respect to marijuana notwithstanding the fact that certain U.S. States have legalized or decriminalized the use, sale and manufacture of marijuana:
 

● | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from U.S. states where it is legal under state law in some form to other U.S. states; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventing U.S. state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Preventing marijuana possession or use on U.S. federal property.

Newsweek recently reported:
 
“Representative Jared Polis (D-Colo.) recently introduced a bill that would make marijuana federally legal and allow the plant to be regulated as alcohol is in the U.S. Under the new bill, called the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, the plant would be removed from its Schedule I listing on the Controlled Substances List and would be regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Adults 21 and up would be able to purchase and consume cannabis legally across the nation. Advertising rules similar to those regarding alcohol would also apply to marijuana under the bill.
 
The Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act is part of a package of three cannabis-related bills introduced Thursday by members of the Cannabis Caucus in the House of Representatives, of which Polis is a member along with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who also sponsored the measures.” 11
 
There is no guarantee that the current presidential administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low priority enforcement of U.S. federal laws that conflict with state laws. Additionally, the new U.S. federal government administration could change this policy and decide to enforce the U.S. federal laws vigorously. Any such change in the U.S. federal government’s enforcement of current U.S. federal laws could cause adverse financial impact to the Company’s business.
 
The Washington Post reported this after Jeff Session’s confirmation hearing for Attorney General on January 10, 2017:
 
“In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Sessions, President-elect Trump’s nominee for attorney general, declined to say whether he’d adhere to the more lenient marijuana enforcement guidelines adopted by the Obama administration’s Justice Department in states that have legalized medicinal or recreational marijuana use. “Would you use our federal resources to investigate and prosecute sick people who are using marijuana in accordance with their state laws, even though it might violate federal laws?” Senator Patrick Leahy (D.-Vermont) asked. “I won’t commit to never enforcing federal law, Senator Leahy,” Sessions replied. “I think some of [the Obama-era guidelines] are truly valuable in evaluating cases,” he added. “Using good judgment about how to handle these cases will be a responsibility of mine. I know it won’t be an easy decision, but I will try to do my duty in a fair and just way.” Under Obama, the Department of Justice largely adopted a hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement in states that legalized the drug for medical or recreational use, provided that certain criteria — like keeping the drug out of the hands of children — were met under state laws. That policy was outlined in a Justice Department document that came to be known as the Cole Memo, for former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole, who drafted the memo.
 
Drug policy experts have said that this tacit green light from the Obama administration was instrumental in Colorado and Washington’s decisions to fully follow through on recreational marijuana laws passed by voters in 2012. In November 2016, four more states including California voted to make the recreational use of marijuana legal, bringing the total to eight states plus the District. Medicinal marijuana has been legalized in 28 states.
 
In prior public statements, Sessions was harshly critical of the Justice Department’s approach on the issue. In an April 2016 Senate drug hearing, Sessions said, “I think one of [Obama’s] great failures, it’s obvious to me, is his lax treatment in comments on marijuana. It reverses 20 years almost of hostility to drugs that began really when Nancy Reagan started ‘Just Say No.’”

In February 2017, the Trump administration announced that there may be “greater enforcement” of federal laws regarding marijuana. In addition, on January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Ogden Memo and the Cole Memos. Any such enforcement actions could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
