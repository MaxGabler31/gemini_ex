Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
We are a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket non-discretionary replacement parts and test solutions and diagnostic equipment.
 
Consistent with our strategic vision statement to be “The Global Leader for Parts and Solutions that Move Our World Today and Tomorrow”, we have implemented a multi-pronged platform for growth in hard parts and test solutions and diagnostic equipment, which are discussed further in the sections below. We operate in the $130 billion market for non-discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement hard parts business in North America. Our current products in the hard parts business include a significant presence in the rotating electrical category (alternators and starters). In January 2019, we expanded our presence into the non-discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement parts for heavy-duty truck, industrial, marine and agricultural applications category with the acquisition of Dixie Electric, Ltd (“Dixie”), a privately held manufacturer and remanufacturer of alternators and starters, based in Ontario, Canada. This acquisition added an estimated $698 million market opportunity for heavy-duty rotating electrical to our existing rotating electrical business.
 
We have a scalable infrastructure, and our growth opportunities remain abundant. Our growth strategy relating to hard parts includes growing market share in all of our existing hard parts product lines with a significant focus on our expanding line of brake products.
 
Our premium non-discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement parts for light-duty applications are primarily sold to automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout North America, and to major automobile manufacturers for both their aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs (“OES”). The current population of light-duty vehicles in the U.S. is approximately 280 million, and the average age of these vehicles is approximately 12 years and is expected to continue to grow, in particular during recession years. The aged vehicle population provides favorable opportunities for sales of our products. Although miles driven can fluctuate for various reasons, including fuel prices, they have been generally increasing for several years prior to 2020. Demand for replacement parts generally increases with the age of vehicles and miles driven.
 
The automotive aftermarket is divided into two markets. The first is the do-it-yourself (“DIY”) market, which is generally serviced by the large retail chain outlets and on-line resellers. Consumers who purchase parts from the DIY market generally install parts into their vehicles themselves. In most cases, this is a less expensive alternative than having the repair performed by a professional installer. The second is the professional installer market, commonly known as the do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) market. Traditional warehouse distributors, dealer networks, and commercial divisions of retail chains service this market. Generally, the consumer in this market is a professional parts installer. Our products are distributed to both the DIY and DIFM markets. The distinction between these two markets has become less defined over the years, as retail outlets leverage their distribution strength and store locations to attract customers.
 
Our non-discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement parts for heavy-duty truck, industrial, marine, and agricultural applications, which have some overlap with the automotive aftermarket, are also sold via specialty distribution channels through OES, fleet, and auto electric outlets.
 
In addition to our hard parts business, our position within the test solutions and diagnostic equipment market is particularly promising. We are focused on expanding our test solutions and diagnostic equipment for performance, endurance, and production of multiple components in the electric power train – providing simulation, emulation, and production applications for the electrification of both automotive and aerospace industries, including electric vehicle charging systems. We have expanded our test solutions and diagnostic equipment applications for combustion engine vehicles, including bench top testers for alternators and starters, and offer test solutions and diagnostic equipment for the pre- and post-production of electric vehicles, as well as software emulation of power systems applications for the electrification of all forms of transportation, including automobiles, trucks and the emerging electrification of systems with the aerospace industry including electric vehicle charging systems.
 


 
The global automotive component and powertrain test solutions and diagnostic equipment market represents a multi-billion-dollar market, and solidly establishes our growth for today and the future, as electrification becomes increasingly important around the world.
 
Growth Strategies and Key Initiatives
 
As noted above, we have a multi-pronged growth strategy: first, we are focused on growing our aftermarket hard parts business in the North American marketplace; second, we are focused on growing our leadership position in test solutions and diagnostic equipment by providing innovative and intuitive solutions to our customers; and third, we are focused on growing our electric vehicle testing business servicing original equipment manufacturers for automotive and aerospace applications on a global basis.
 
To accomplish our strategic vision, we are focused on the following key initiatives:

Segment Reporting
 
Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for segment reporting, we have identified our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understand how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. We have determined through this review process that our business comprises three separate operating segments. All of the operating segments meet all the aggregation criteria, and are aggregated.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We sell our products to the largest automotive chains, including Advance (inclusive of Carquest, Autopart International, and Worldpac), AutoZone, Genuine Parts (NAPA), and O’Reilly with an aggregate of approximately 25,000 retail outlets. In addition, our products are sold to OES customers, professional installers, and a diverse group of automotive warehouse distributors. We also sell test solutions and diagnostic equipment via direct and indirect sales channels, technical conferences, and trade shows to some of the world’s leading automotive companies, and to the aerospace/aviation sector. We also offer testing services at our technical center located in Detroit, Michigan. During fiscal 2022, we sold approximately 99% of our products in North America, with approximately 1% of our products sold in Asian and European countries.
 
We publish printed and electronic catalogs with part numbers and applications for our hard parts products along with a detailed technical glossary and informational database. In addition, we publish printed and electronic product and service brochures and data sheets for our test solutions and diagnostic equipment and service offerings. We believe that we maintain one of the most extensive catalog and product identification systems available to the market.
 
We primarily ship our products from our facilities and various third-party warehouse distribution centers in North America, including our 410,000 square foot distribution center in Tijuana, Mexico.
 
Customers: Customer Concentration. While we continually seek to diversify our customer base, we currently derive, and have historically derived, a substantial portion of our sales from a small number of large customers. Sales to our three largest customers in the aggregate represented 85%, 87%, and 84%, and sales to our largest customer, AutoZone, represented 38%, 42%, and 38% of our net sales during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any meaningful reduction in the level of sales to any of these customers, deterioration of the financial condition of any of these customers or the loss of any of these customers could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
  


 
Customer Arrangements; Impact on Working Capital. We have various length agreements with our customers. Under these agreements, which in most cases have initial terms of at least four years, we are designated as the exclusive or primary supplier for specified categories of our products. Because of the very competitive nature of the market and the limited number of customers for these products, our customers have sought and obtained price concessions, significant marketing allowances and more favorable delivery and payment terms in consideration for our designation as a customer’s exclusive or primary supplier. These incentives differ from contract to contract and can include: (i) the purchase of Remanufactured Core inventory on customer shelves, (ii) the issuance of a specified amount of credits against receivables in accordance with a schedule set forth in the relevant contract, (iii) support for a particular customer’s research or marketing efforts provided on a scheduled basis, (iv) discounts granted in connection with each individual shipment of product, and (v) store expansion or product development support. These contracts typically require that we meet ongoing performance standards.
 
While these longer-term agreements strengthen our customer relationships, the increased demand for our products often requires that we increase our inventories and personnel. Customer demands that we purchase and maintain their Remanufactured Core inventory also requires the use of our working capital. The marketing and other allowances we typically grant our customers in connection with our new or expanded customer relationships adversely impact near-term revenues, profitability and associated cash flows from these arrangements. However, we believe the investment we make in these new or expanded customer relationships will improve our overall liquidity and cash flow from operations over time.
 
Competition
 
Our business is highly competitive. We compete with several large and medium-sized companies, including BBB Industries and Cardone Industries for hard parts, and AVL and Horiba for test solutions and diagnostic equipment, and a large number of smaller regional and specialty companies. We also compete with other overseas manufacturers, particularly those located in China who are increasing their operations and could become a significant competitive force in the future.
 
We believe that the reputations for quality, reliability, and customer service that a supplier provides are significant factors in our customers’ purchase decisions. We continuously strive to increase our competitive and technical advantages as the industry and technologies rapidly evolve. Our advanced power emulators are protected by U.S. patents that provide us a strong competitive barrier for a large segment of the market and allow us to be lower cost and more efficient.
 
We believe our ability to educate also helps to distinguish us from many of our competitors. We have created an online library of video courses, aimed at supporting our customers as they seek to train the next generation of technicians. We also offer live and web-based training courses via our education center within our Torrance, California headquarters. We believe our ability to provide quality replacement automotive parts, rapid and reliable delivery capabilities as well as promotional support also distinguishes us from many of our competitors. In addition, favorable pricing, our core exchange programs, and extended payment terms are also very important competitive factors in customers’ purchase decisions.
 
We seek to protect our proprietary processes and other information by relying on trade secret laws and non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees and other persons who have access to that information.
 
Operations
 
Production Process for Non-discretionary Replacement Parts. The majority of our products are remanufactured at our facilities in Mexico, Canada, and to a lesser extent in Malaysia. We continue to maintain production of certain remanufactured units that require specialized service and/or rapid turnaround in our Torrance, California facility. We also manufacture and assemble new products at our facilities in Malaysia and India. Our remanufacturing process begins with the receipt of Used Cores from our customers or core brokers. The Used Cores are evaluated for inventory control purposes and then sorted by part number. Each Used Core is completely disassembled into its fundamental components. The components are cleaned in an environmentally sound process that employs customized equipment and cleaning materials in accordance with the required specifications of the particular component. All components known to be subject to major wear and those components determined not to be reusable or repairable are replaced by new components. Non-salvageable components of the Used Core are sold as scrap.
  


 
After the cleaning process is complete, the salvageable components of the Used Core are inspected and tested as prescribed by our IATF 16949 and ISO 9001:2015 approved quality programs, which have been implemented throughout the production processes. IATF 16949 and ISO 9001:2015 are internationally recognized, world class, quality programs. Upon passage of all tests, which are monitored by designated quality control personnel, all the component parts are assembled in a work cell into a finished product. Inspection and testing are conducted at multiple stages of the remanufacturing process, and each finished product is inspected and tested on equipment designed to simulate performance under operating conditions. To maximize remanufacturing efficiency, we store component parts ready for assembly in our production facilities.
 
Our remanufacturing processes combine product families with similar configurations into dedicated factory work cells. This remanufacturing process, known as “lean manufacturing,” eliminated a large number of inventory moves and the need to track inventory movement through the remanufacturing process. This lean manufacturing process has been fully implemented at our existing production facilities and we expect to implement this process at our recently acquired facilities. This manufacturing enables us to significantly reduce the time it takes to produce a finished product. We continue to explore opportunities for improving efficiencies in our remanufacturing process.
 
Production Process for Test Solutions and Diagnostic Equipment. Our test solutions and diagnostic equipment are engineered and manufactured in North America at facilities in Toronto, Canada and Binghamton, New York, U.S. Our facility in Canada is certified under ISO 9001:2015 quality management system, which mandates that we foster continuous improvement to our manufacturing processes. Materials for custom systems are purchased in a “just-in-time” environment while materials for standard systems are purchased in economic quantities. All materials and components are inspected and tested when required. Certain components require certificates of compliance or test results from our vendors prior to shipping to us. Our manufacturing process combines skilled labor from certified and licensed technicians with raw materials, manufactured components, purchased components, and purchased capital components to complete our test solutions and diagnostic equipment. All test solutions and diagnostic equipment are inspected and tested per our quality control program, which has been approved by the ISO 9001:2015 quality management system.
 
Our facility in New York, U.S., manufactures test solutions and diagnostic equipment using purchased electronic and custom components that are primarily assembled at this facility. While some circuit card assemblies are handled by outside subcontractors, most of the assemblies are manufactured in-house along with the fabrication of electronic subassemblies. Quality control and testing is completed on these subassemblies prior to their final installation into the overall equipment rack that includes mechanical, electrical and thermal management operations. Final inspection and acceptance testing are performed to predefined procedures prior to the equipment being packaged in a crate for shipment.
 
Used Cores. The majority of our Used Cores are obtained from customers through the core exchange programs. To supplement Used Cores received from our customers we purchase Used Cores from core brokers. Although this is not a primary source of Used Cores, it is a critical source for meeting our raw material demands. Remanufacturing consumes, on average, more than one Used Core for each remanufactured unit produced since not all Used Cores are reusable. The yield rates depend upon both the product and customer specifications.
 
We recycle materials, including metal from the Used Cores and corrugated packaging, in keeping with our focus as a remanufacturer to lessen our footprint on the environment.
 
Purchased Finished Goods. In addition to our remanufactured goods, we also purchase finished goods from various approved suppliers, including several located in Asia. We perform supplier qualification, product inspection and testing according to our IATF 16949 or ISO 9001:2015 certified quality systems to assure product quality levels. We also perform periodic site audits of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities.
  


 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital
 
Our Culture. Our Company was founded in 1968 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others.  Our core values are Excellence, Passion/Productivity, Innovation/Integrity, Community and Quality (“EPICQ”) and characterize our daily corporate focus. These values are embodied in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by our Board of Directors to serve as a statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business. We believe that our commitment to our Company, our employees and the communities within which we operate has led to high employee satisfaction and low employee turnover, and our commitment to our customers, suppliers and business partners has resulted in high customer satisfaction, as evidenced by the customer awards that we routinely win, and decades-long customer relationships.
 
Environmental. Environmental and sustainable processes have been our hallmark since the Company’s establishment. We take our commitment to environmental stewardship seriously. The use of Remanufactured Cores results in a substantial reduction of raw materials and energy consumption. With the potential to significantly reduce material and energy consumption, industry sources believe that remanufacturing is the most efficient and sustainable process for producing aftermarket replacement parts – making our business practices green by nature. See more information on this at investors.motorcarparts.com/esg. Highlights of our eco-friendly remanufacturing processes include:

Human Capital. We regard our team members as integral to our strategic growth and success. We recognize that safety, inclusion, and offering exciting opportunities are fundamental to facilitating high retention and satisfaction of high performance team members. Equally important, we provide competitive compensation and excellent benefit programs, and support numerous programs that build connections between our team members and their communities. We believe our team members share our corporate ethics and values, as demonstrated in their daily interactions with customers, co-workers, vendors, and the public at large.
 
As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 5,800 people, with 400 people in the United States, 4,900 people in Mexico, 200 people Canada, and 300 people in Malaysia and China. Approximately 5,400 people are production employees. We have non-union and unionized facilities. Approximately 4,800 production employees are covered by a local union. We believe we have a strong relationship with the union that represents our employees.
 
Our facilities are located in labor markets with readily available access to skilled and unskilled workers. Our relationship and communication with our unionized and non-represented workforce is good.
 
Inclusion and Diversity. Our board is ethnically diverse and comprised of 10 independent directors, including three women. We believe an inclusive workforce is critical to our success, with an ongoing focus on the hiring, retention, and advancement of women and other underrepresented ethnic groups. The Company employs 37% women and 63% men globally. In the United States, 76% of our workforce are considered ethnic minorities.
 
Health, Safety and Wellness.  The success of our business is connected to the safety and well-being of our team members and their families. We provide our employees and their families with flexible and convenient health and wellness programs – including protection and security to lessen concerns about missing work and the potential financial impact.  Our programs are intended to support the physical and mental well-being with the tools and resources for employees to improve or maintain their health, and we encourage engagement in healthy behaviors for team members and their families.
  


 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous changes in the interest of our team members. All of these changes meet and/or exceed Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and other government regulations. These programs involve providing employees with flexible working arrangements – including, where appropriate, the ability to work from home, and the implementation of numerous safety policies and practices at all of our facilities. Please see the discussion in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” as well as in Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Compensation and benefits. We provide competitive compensation and benefit programs that meet the needs of our employees, and are tailored to their local markets. In addition to wages and salaries, these programs may include annual cash bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare, and insurance, and implemented methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent.
 
Social Responsibility. We are firmly committed to social responsibility. While safety, respect, and inclusion have always been fundamental to our company, these qualities are more important than ever given the global pandemic and the impact it is having on our employees, family members, and the community at large. Medical professionals are onsite or within close proximity to our operations, and management is doing everything possible to address the challenges. In addition, our socially responsible initiatives include subsidized food programs for certain employees, donations to community organizations, sponsorship of sport teams and weekend family events, which hopefully, will become possible again as our Company and the world recovers. In addition, we have plans to launch an Agri-farm organic food and community program in Mexico to enhance our social responsibility practices on a global basis.
 
Information Security and Risk Oversight
 
We have an information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection, network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. We have also implemented employee awareness training programs around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. We continually evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data and have instituted additional measures to help protect us from system intrusion or data breaches.
 
Our Board of Directors appointed the Audit Committee with direct oversight of Company’s: (i) information security policies, including periodic assessment of risk of information security breach, training program, significant threat changes and vulnerabilities and monitoring metrics and (ii) effectiveness of information security policy implementation. Our Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors, one of whom has significant work experience related to information security issues or oversight. Management will report information security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and will provide a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our businesses, operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Potentially significant expenditures, however, could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
