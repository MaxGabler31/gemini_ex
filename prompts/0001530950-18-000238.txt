ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION 
Post Holdings, Inc. is a Missouri corporation incorporated on September 22, 2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 2503 S. Hanley Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63144. We are a consumer packaged goods holding company, operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, foodservice, food ingredient, active nutrition and private brand food categories. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in this Form 10-K to “Post,” “the Company,” “us,” “our” or “we” mean Post Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, which includes 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. (“8th Avenue”) and its subsidiaries when referencing a time period on or prior to September 30, 2018 and excludes 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries when referencing a time period after September 30, 2018. 
On February 3, 2012, Post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin-off from our former parent company. On February 6, 2012, Post common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “POST.” As of September 30, 2018, Post operated in five reportable segments: 

• | Post Consumer Brands: Includes branded and private label ready-to-eat (“RTE”) cereal operations of Post Foods, LLC, MOM Brands Company (“MOM Brands”), which Post acquired in May 2015, and Weetabix North America (“Weetabix NA”), which Post acquired as part of its acquisition of Latimer Newco 2 Limited, a company registered in England and Wales (“Latimer”), and all of Latimer’s direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time of acquisition, including Weetabix Limited (collectively the “Weetabix Group”), in July 2017;


• | Weetabix: Includes the businesses of Weetabix Limited and its direct subsidiaries (“Weetabix”), which produce and distribute branded and private label RTE cereal, hot cereals and other cereal-based food products, breakfast drinks and muesli primarily outside of North America, which Post acquired as part of its acquisition of the Weetabix Group in July 2017;


• | Refrigerated Food: Includes the businesses of MFI Holding Corporation (“Michael Foods”), which Post acquired in June 2014, Willamette Egg Farms, which Post acquired in October 2015, National Pasteurized Eggs, Inc., which Post acquired in October 2016, and Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (“Bob Evans”) after its acquisition in January 2018, and is comprised of refrigerated foodservice, primarily egg and potato, and refrigerated retail, inclusive of side dishes, egg, cheese and sausage;


• | Active Nutrition: Includes the protein shakes, bars and powders and nutritional supplement businesses of Premier Nutrition Corporation (“PNC”), which Post acquired in September 2013, Dymatize Enterprises, LLC (“Dymatize”), which Post acquired in February 2014, and the PowerBar brand, which Post acquired in October 2014, and includes Active Nutrition International; and


• | Private Brands: Included the businesses of Attune Foods, LLC, which is composed of the former business of Attune Foods, Inc., acquired by Post in December 2012, and the granola and snacks business of Hearthside Food Solutions, LLC, acquired by Post in an asset purchase in May 2013, Dakota Growers Pasta Company, Inc. (“Dakota Growers”), acquired by Post in January 2014, and Golden Boy Foods Ltd. (“Golden Boy”), acquired by Post in February 2014, which collectively produce private label peanut and other nut butters, dried fruit and nuts, pasta products and premium natural and organic granola, cereals and snacks, as well as the business of American Blanching Company (“ABC”), acquired by Post in November 2014, which provides peanut blanching, granulation and roasting services for the commercial peanut industry.

On October 1, 2018, Post, together with its subsidiary, 8th Avenue, completed its previously announced transaction with affiliates of the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (collectively, “THL”), in which Post and THL separately capitalized 8th Avenue. 8th Avenue became the holding company for Post’s private brands food products business, which has historically been reported and is reported herein as Post’s Private Brands segment. After completion of the transaction, Post retained 60.5% of the common equity in 8th Avenue, which, effective October 1, 2018, is accounted for using the equity method and is no longer consolidated in the Company's financial statements, and the private brands business is no longer considered a reportable segment of Post.
On November 15, 2018, Post announced its intention to pursue an initial public offering of its Active Nutrition business.

Our Businesses
Post Consumer Brands 
Post Consumer Brands includes our North America cereal business which manufactures, markets and sells branded and private label RTE cereal and hot cereal products. The RTE cereal category is one of the most prominent categories in the food industry. According to Nielsen’s expanded All Outlets Combined (xAOC) information, the category was approximately $8.2 billion for the 52-week period ending October 27, 2018. We have leveraged the strength of our brands, category expertise and over a century of institutional knowledge to create a diverse portfolio of cereals. Post Consumer Brands is the third largest seller of RTE cereals in the United States with a 20.1% share of retail dollar sales and a 22.7% share of retail pound sales for the 52-week period ending October 27, 2018, based on Nielsen’s xAOC information. Nielsen’s xAOC is representative of food, drug and mass merchandisers (including Walmart), some club retailers (including Sam’s Club and BJs), some dollar retailers (including Dollar General, Family Dollar and Fred’s Super Dollar) and military. Our RTE cereal brands include Honey Bunches of Oats, Pebbles, Oreo O’s, Great Grains, Grape-Nuts, Post Shredded Wheat, Oh’s, Honeycomb, Golden Crisp, Post Raisin Bran, Alpha-Bits, Shreddies, Malt-O-Meal branded bagged cereal and Mom’s Best. Our hot cereal brands include Malt-O-Meal Hot Wheat, Coco Wheats, Better Oats and Mom’s Best Oatmeal. Post Consumer Brands also includes the natural and organic RTE cereal and snacking platform in both branded and private label of Weetabix NA, led by the Weetabix and Barbara’s brands and the Puffins sub-brand, serving the natural and specialty channels and conventional retailers. The Post Consumer Brands business’s products are primarily manufactured through a flexible production platform at ten owned facilities in the United States and Canada. 
Cereal and granola products sold by our Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix and the historical Private Brands segments together for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 contributed 37.6%, 37.6% and 36.6%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.
Weetabix
Our Weetabix segment primarily markets and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal products. Weetabix holds the number two overall position in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) RTE cereal category. Its portfolio includes the Weetabix brand, which holds the number one brand position in the U.K. RTE cereal category, as well as Alpen (the number one muesli brand in the U.K.), Weetos, Ready Brek and Weetabix On The Go. Its main markets are the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, where Weetabix has deep relationships with all key retailers and key players in wholesale and foodservice. Weetabix also distributes products to multiple countries throughout the world, mainly through a network of third party distributors in the respective markets. Additionally, Weetabix has operations in Africa through two joint ventures.
Refrigerated Food 
Through our Refrigerated Food segment, comprised of our legacy Michael Foods business and the Bob Evans business acquired in January 2018, we produce and/or distribute egg products, sausage, side dishes, cheese and other refrigerated products to retail and foodservice customers. Our egg business produces and distributes numerous products under the Papetti’s, Easy Eggs, Table Ready, All Whites, Davidson’s Safest Choice, Abbotsford Farms, Better’n Eggs and Emulsa brands, among others. We operate thirteen egg products production facilities in the United States, some of which are fully integrated, from the maintenance of laying flocks through the processing of egg products. For fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, egg and egg products contributed 24.6%, 27.1% and 28.1%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue. Our refrigerated side dish and sausage products are marketed primarily under the Bob Evans, Bob Evans Farms, Simply Potatoes, Pineland Farms, Owens and Diner’s Choice brands; the Refrigerated Food segment maintains processing facilities for these products in Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Texas and Nevada. Our cheese and other dairy case products are marketed principally under the Crystal Farms brand, and other trademarks include Crescent Valley, Westfield Farms and David’s Deli. We operate a facility in Lake Mills, Wisconsin, which processes and packages various cheese products for the Crystal Farms brand and for private label customers.
Active Nutrition 
Our Active Nutrition segment markets and distributes ready-to-drink beverages, bars, powders and other nutritional supplements under the Premier Protein, Dymatize, PowerBar, Supreme Protein and Joint Juice brands. The Active Nutrition segment’s products are primarily manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the United States and Europe. We also own a facility in Germany that manufactures bar products for our Active Nutrition brands and private label customers. Our Active Nutrition products are sold in club, mass merchandise, grocery, drug, specialty and convenience stores as well as online. For fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, protein-based products and supplements contributed 13.2%, 13.6% and 11.4%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.

Private Brands 
Our historical Private Brands segment manufactures and distributes private label peanut and other nut butters, dried fruit and nuts, pasta products, premium natural and organic granola, cereals and snacks, with sales to customers in the foodservice, retail and food ingredient channels primarily in the United States and Canada, and also in the European Union and the Middle East. The historical Private Brands business also co-manufactures peanut and other nut butters for national brands, private label retail markets and industrial markets. In addition, the historical Private Brands business provides peanut blanching, granulation and roasting services for the commercial peanut industry. Effective October 1, 2018, this business became an unconsolidated equity investment and is no longer a reportable segment of Post.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to its product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and joint advertising with select retail customers. We also use traditional outdoor, print and digital advertising and social media, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events and business drops, in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment. 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. We also sell Post Consumer Brands products to military, e-commerce and foodservice channels and may utilize distribution or similar arrangements for sales of Post Consumer Brands products. Our Weetabix segment services its key U.K. markets through a centralized commercial team which manages relationships with customers at the corporate level while a third party sales force operates at the store level to ensure maximum availability and compliance with agreed plans. Our Refrigerated Food segment aligns its sales and marketing efforts by distribution channel, with a dedicated team of internal sales staff and broker organizations for each of the commercial and retail channels. Our Active Nutrition segment uses a flexible sales model that combines a national and international direct sales force, broker network and distributors. Our historical Private Brands segment primarily sells its products through internal sales staff and broker organizations, including a strong broker network that services the natural/specialty and conventional grocery channels.
Generally our products are distributed through a network of third party common carriers. In addition, our Refrigerated Food segment has an internal fleet that distributes certain of its refrigerated retail products.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients and packaging technologies; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials used in our businesses (purchased from local, regional and international suppliers) consist of ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for most of our businesses are agricultural commodities, including wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, vegetable oils, dried fruit, nuts, dairy and soy-based proteins, cocoa, corn syrup and sugar. Additionally, the principal ingredients for the Refrigerated Food business are eggs, pork, potatoes, cheese, milk and butter. A portion of the segment’s egg needs comes from Company-owned hens, and the balance is purchased under third party contracts and in the spot market. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. In addition, we procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in various United States locations. Each of our segments utilize raw material sources that ensure that its products meet standards and certification requirements, for example, non-GMO, organic, gluten-free and/or cage-free. The principal packaging materials used by the Company are linerboard cartons, corrugated boxes, plastic containers, flexible and beverage packaging, cartonboard, and aseptic foil and plastic lined cartonboard. 
Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to external factors, such as weather conditions, feed costs, labor disputes, government policies and regulations, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances, such as avian influenza and diseases affecting livestock, which could affect the domestic poultry industry and our egg supply and our sow supply, respectively. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources.
Cereal processing ovens and most of the Refrigerated Food production facilities are generally fueled by natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our processing facilities. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in the event of an interruption 
5

in natural gas supplies. Oil also may be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. Weetabix owns and operates its own combined heat and power generation unit, which is capable of supplying the majority of the requirements of its main operation site with power and steam and can be operated using either natural gas or oil.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We own or have long-term licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business’s key trademarks include Post®, Honey Bunches of Oats®, Great Grains®, Post® Shredded Wheat, Spoon Size® Shredded Wheat, Golden Crisp®, Alpha-Bits®, Oh's®, ShreddiesTM, Post® Raisin Bran, Grape-Nuts®, Honeycomb®, Frosted Mini Spooners®, Golden Puffs®, Cinnamon Toasters®, Fruity Dyno-Bites®, Cocoa Dyno-Bites®, Berry Colossal Crunch®, Malt-O-Meal®, Farina®, Dyno-Bites®, MOM’s Best®, Better OatsTM, CoCo WheatsTM, Weetabix®, Barbara’s® and Puffins®, each of which we own, as well as several trademarks that we license from third parties for use in the United States, Canada and several other international markets, such as Pebbles™, Oreo O’s®, Nilla®, Nutter Butter®, Chips Ahoy!® and Honeymaid®. Our Weetabix segment’s key trademarks include Weetabix®, Alpen®, Weetos™, Ready Brek™, Weetabix On The Go™ and Oatibix™, each of which we own. The key trademarks for the Refrigerated Food business include Papetti’s®, Easy Eggs®, Table Ready®, All Whites®, Davidson’s Safest Choice®, Abbotsford Farms®, Better’n Eggs®, Emulsa®, Crystal Farms®, Simply Potatoes®, Diner’s Choice®, Crescent Valley®, Westfield Farms®, David’s Deli®, Owens® and Country Creek Farm®, each of which we own, and Bob Evans®, Bob Evans Farms® and Pineland Farms®, which we license for worldwide use. Our Active Nutrition segment’s key trademarks include Premier Protein®, Joint Juice®, Dymatize®, ISO.100®, Supreme Protein® and PowerBar®, each of which we own. The key trademarks of our historical Private Brands segment include Attune®, Golden Boy™, Nut ’n Better™, Willamette Valley Granola Company™, Dakota Growers Pasta Co.®, Dreamfields® and Golden Organics®, which, effective October 1, 2018, 8th Avenue directly or indirectly owns. Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the United States or the U.K., as well as in many other countries where the related products are sold. 
We also own several patents in North America and elsewhere. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Seasonality
Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events. For example, demand for our egg products, sausage, side dishes and cheese tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the first quarter of our fiscal year. We also have experienced increased demand for the snacking and baking nuts manufactured and distributed through our historical Private Brands segment during the Thanksgiving, Christmas and holiday seasons. Demand for our Malt-O-Meal hot wheat, Better Oats oatmeal and Ready Brek hot oats cereals also tends to be seasonably skewed towards the colder winter season. However, on a consolidated basis our revenues and results of operations are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year.
Working Capital
A description of our working capital practices is included in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. Cash receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our operating expenses and working capital needs.
Customers
We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery stores, mass merchandise customers, supercenters, club stores, natural/specialty stores and drug store customers. We also sell to military, e-commerce and foodservice channels. Our Weetabix segment’s products are primarily sold to grocery stores, discounters, wholesalers and convenience stores. Our Refrigerated Food segment’s primary customers include foodservice distributors, national restaurant chains, retail grocery stores, mass merchandise customers and major food manufacturers and processors. Our Active Nutrition segment’s customers are predominately club stores, mass merchandise customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores and online retailers, and also include specialty retailers, supplement stores and distributors. Our historical Private Brands segment’s products are sold primarily to the natural/specialty and conventional grocery stores, mass merchandise customers and discount stores and foodservice and food ingredient customers. 
Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, but certain of our segments depend on sales to large customers. For example, the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, Walmart, accounted for approximately 29% of Post Consumer Brands’ net sales in fiscal 2018. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco, Asda, Morrison’s and Sainsbury’s, accounted for approximately 52% of Weetabix’s net sales in fiscal 2018. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Food segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for approximately 27% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2018, 
6

and the largest customers of our Active Nutrition business, Costco and Sam’s Club, accounted for approximately 59% of the Active Nutrition segment’s net sales in fiscal 2018. The largest customer of our historical Private Brands segment, Whole Foods, accounted for approximately 16% of Private Brands’ net sales in fiscal 2018. 
Competition
The consumer food and beverage, sports nutrition and sports supplement categories in which we operate are highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Many of our principal competitors in these categories may have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources. Competition is based on, among other things, product quality, price, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products. The industries in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Europe are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our business in the United States. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, storage, distribution, labeling and marketing standards administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and the European Union. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. Additionally, following the recent adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA is implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
Certain meat and egg products produced by our Refrigerated Food segment are under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and its regulations regarding quality, labeling and sanitary control, rather than FDA regulations. The Refrigerated Food egg processing plants that break eggs, and some of our other meat and egg-processing operations, are subject to continuous on-site USDA inspection. Our other United States facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the USDA, FDA and/or state regulatory authorities, such as state departments of agriculture. The pork product manufacturing operations of our Refrigerated Food segment are subject to the Packers & Stockyards Act, which also is administered by the USDA and which regulates trade practices.
Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulations in Canada, the U.K. and Germany. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on prices and supplies of these commodities.
In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and Privacy Shield, which apply to certain of our businesses and deal with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects of the European Union. Our operations also are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater pretreatment and discharge, storm water, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Our foreign facilities are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to us in the United States. Additionally, Refrigerated Food layer farms dispose of animal waste primarily by transferring it to farmers for use as fertilizer, and Refrigerated Food potato product facilities dispose of solid vegetable waste primarily by transferring it to processors who convert it to animal feed. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure environmental compliance. 
Employees
The Company and its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries have approximately 11,550 employees as of November 1, 2018, of which approximately 9,300 are in the United States, approximately 1,010 are in the U.K., approximately 835 are in Canada and approximately 405 are located in other jurisdictions. Currently, approximately 17% of such employees are unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. As these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We believe that overall we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations.
