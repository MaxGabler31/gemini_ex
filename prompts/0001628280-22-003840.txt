Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We began operations in 1997 and, based on the number of facilities, are one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we had operations in 46 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals in 28 states, 30 rehabilitation hospitals in 12 states, and 1,881 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 38 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2021, Concentra operated 518 occupational health centers in 41 states. Concentra also provides contract services at employer worksites.
We manage our Company through four business segments: our critical illness recovery hospital segment, our rehabilitation hospital segment, our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and our Concentra segment. We had revenue of $6,204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of this total, we earned approximately 36% of our revenue from our critical illness recovery hospital segment, approximately 14% from our rehabilitation hospital segment, approximately 17% from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and approximately 28% from our Concentra segment. We also recognized revenue associated with employee leasing services provided to the Company’s non-consolidating subsidiaries; these revenues are included as part of our other activities.
Our critical illness recovery hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of patients recovering from critical illnesses, often with complex medical needs, and our rehabilitation hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive physical rehabilitation care. Patients are typically admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals from general acute care hospitals. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics that provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation services. Our Concentra segment consists of occupational health centers and contract services provided at employer worksites that deliver occupational medicine, physical therapy, and consumer health services. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 15. Segment Information” beginning on F-28 for financial information for each of our segments for the past three fiscal years.
Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals
We are a leading operator of critical illness recovery hospitals in the United States, which are certified by Medicare as long term care hospitals (“LTCHs”). As of December 31, 2021, we operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals in 28 states. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, approximately 49%, 43% and 37%, respectively, of the revenue of our critical illness recovery hospital segment came from Medicare reimbursement. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 14,500 people in our critical illness recovery hospital segment, consisting primarily of registered nurses, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists.
We operate the majority of our critical illness recovery hospitals as a hospital within a hospital (an “HIH”). A critical illness recovery hospital that operates as an HIH typically leases space from a general acute care hospital, or “host hospital,” and operates as a separately licensed hospital within the host hospital, or on the same campus as the host hospital. In contrast, a free-standing critical illness recovery hospital does not operate on a host hospital campus. We operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals at December 31, 2021, of which 75 were operated as HIHs and 29 were operated as free-standing hospitals.
Patients are typically admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals from general acute care hospitals, likely following an intensive care unit stay, and suffer from chronic critical illness. These patients have highly specialized needs, with serious and complex medical conditions involving multiple organ systems. These conditions are often a result of complications related to heart failure, complex infectious disease, respiratory failure and pulmonary disease, complex surgery requiring prolonged recovery, renal disease, neurological events, and trauma. Given their complex medical needs, these patients require a longer length of stay than patients in a general acute care hospital and benefit from being treated in a critical illness recovery hospital that is designed to meet their unique medical needs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the average length of stay for patients in our critical illness recovery hospitals was 30 days.
Additionally, we continually seek to increase our admissions by demonstrating our quality outcomes and, by doing so, expanding and improving our relationships with the physicians and general acute care hospitals in the markets where we operate. We maintain a strong focus on the provision of high-quality medical care within our facilities. The Joint Commission (“TJC”), DNV GL Healthcare USA, Inc. (“DNV”), and the Center for Improvement in Healthcare Quality (“CIHQ”) are independent accreditation organizations that establish standards related to the operation and management of healthcare facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals, 101 of which were accredited by TJC. Two of our critical illness recovery hospitals were accredited by DNV and one of our critical illness recovery hospitals was accredited by CIHQ. Also as of December 31, 2021, all of our critical illness recovery hospitals were certified as LTCHs. Each of our critical illness recovery hospitals must regularly demonstrate to a survey team conformance to the applicable standards established by TJC, DNV, CIHQ, or the Medicare program, as applicable.
When a patient is referred to one of our critical illness recovery hospitals by a physician, case manager, discharge planner, or payor, a clinical assessment is performed to determine patient eligibility for admission. Based on the determinations reached in this clinical assessment, an admission decision is made.
Upon admission, an interdisciplinary team meets to perform a comprehensive review of the patient’s condition. The interdisciplinary team is composed of a number of clinicians and may include any or all of the following: an attending physician; a registered nurse; a physical, occupational, and speech therapist; a respiratory therapist; a dietitian; a pharmacist; and a case manager. Upon completion of an initial evaluation by each member of the treatment team, an individualized treatment plan is established and initiated. Case management coordinates all aspects of the patient’s hospital stay and serves as a liaison to the insurance carrier’s case management staff as appropriate. The case manager specifically communicates clinical progress, resource utilization, and treatment goals to the patient, the treatment team, and the payor.
Each of our critical illness recovery hospitals has a distinct medical staff that is composed of physicians from multiple specialties that have successfully completed the required privileging and credentialing process. In general, physicians on the medical staff are not directly employed but are more commonly independent, practicing at multiple hospitals in the community. Attending physicians conduct daily rounds on their patients while consulting physicians provide consulting services based on the specific medical needs of our patients. Each critical illness recovery hospital develops on-call arrangements with individual physicians to help ensure that a physician is available to care for our patients. When determining the appropriate composition of the medical staff of a critical illness recovery hospital, we consider the size of the critical illness recovery hospital, services provided by the critical illness recovery hospital, if applicable, the size and capabilities of the medical staff of the general acute care hospital that hosts that HIH and, if applicable, the proximity of an acute care hospital to the free-standing critical illness recovery hospital. The medical staff of each of our critical illness recovery hospitals meets the applicable requirements set forth by Medicare, the hospital’s applicable accrediting organizations, and the state in which that critical illness recovery hospital is located.
Our critical illness recovery hospital segment is led by a president, chief operating officer, chief medical officer, chief nursing officer, and chief quality officer. Each of our critical illness recovery hospitals has an onsite management team consisting of a chief executive officer, a medical director, a chief nursing officer, and a director of business development. These teams manage local strategy and day-to-day operations, including oversight of clinical care and treatment. They also assume primary responsibility for developing relationships with the general acute care providers and clinicians in the local areas we serve that refer patients to our critical illness recovery hospitals. We provide our critical illness recovery hospitals with centralized accounting, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, management information systems, and billing and collection services. The centralization of these services improves efficiency and permits staff at our critical illness recovery hospitals to focus their time on patient care.
For a description of government regulations and Medicare payments made to our critical illness recovery hospitals, see “—Government Regulations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Strategy
The key elements of our critical illness recovery hospital strategy are to:
Focus on Specialized Inpatient Services. We serve highly acute patients and patients with debilitating injuries and rehabilitation needs that cannot be adequately cared for in a less medically intensive environment, such as a skilled nursing facility. Patients admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals require long stays, benefiting from a more specialized and targeted clinical approach. Our care model is distinct from what patients experience in general acute care hospitals.
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. Our critical illness recovery hospitals serve a critical role in comprehensive healthcare delivery. Through our specialized treatment programs and staffing models, we treat patients with acute, highly complex, and specialized medical needs. Our treatment programs focus on specific patient needs and medical conditions, such as ventilator weaning protocols, comprehensive wound care assessments and treatment protocols, medication review and antibiotic stewardship, infection control prevention, and customized mobility, speech, and swallow programs. Our staffing models seek to ensure that patients have the appropriate clinical resources over the course of their stay. We maintain quality assurance programs to support and monitor quality of care standards and to meet regulatory requirements and maintain Medicare certifications. We believe that we are recognized for providing quality care and service, which helps develop brand loyalty in the local areas we serve.
Our treatment programs are continuously reassessed and updated based on peer-reviewed literature. This approach provides our clinicians access to the best practices and protocols that we have found to be effective in treating various conditions in this population such as respiratory failure, non-healing wounds, brain injury, renal dysfunction, and complex infectious diseases. In addition, we customize these programs to provide a treatment plan tailored to meet our patients’ unique needs. The collaborative team-based approach coupled with the intense focus on patient safety and quality affords these highly complex patients the best opportunity to recover from catastrophic illness. This comprehensive care model is ultimately measured by the functional recovery of each of our patients.
Our critical illness recovery hospitals demonstrated a critical role in caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our critical illness recovery hospitals were and continue to be in a position to enhance and promote recovery of patients with COVID-19, as many patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 require prolonged mechanical ventilation. We have developed specialized strategies for liberation from prolonged mechanical ventilation, promoting physical recovery through innovative therapies and nutrition programs while reducing risk of adverse ventilator-associated events including pneumonia and infection. Our critical illness recovery hospitals demonstrated rapid preparation and implementation of modifications that supported the treatment of active COVID-19 patients and patients recovering from moderate-to-severe response to COVID-19 infection. Successful treatment resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of COVID-19 patients who were discharged to home and lower level of care compared to non-COVID-19 patients. We have demonstrated that our critical illness recovery hospitals can substitute for ICU beds in regions with high COVID-19 surge levels and as a post-ICU provider for patients who require longer-term care while recovering from severe complications from COVID-19. 
The quality of the patient care we provide is continually monitored using several measures, including clinical outcomes data and analyses and patient satisfaction surveys. Quality metrics from our critical illness recovery hospitals are used to create monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting for our leadership team. In order to benchmark ourselves against other hospitals, we collect our clinical and patient satisfaction information and compare it to national standards and the results of other healthcare organizations. We are required to report quality measures to individual states based on unique requirements and laws. We also submit required quality data elements to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). See “—Government Regulations—Other Medicare Regulations—Medicare Quality Reporting.”
Control Operating Costs. We continually seek to improve operating efficiency and control costs at our critical illness recovery hospitals by standardizing operations and centralizing key administrative functions. These initiatives include:
•centralizing administrative functions such as accounting, finance, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, and billing and collection;
•standardizing management information systems to assist in capturing the medical record, accounting, billing, collections, and data capture and analysis; and
•centralizing sourcing and contracting to receive discounted prices for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and other commodities used in our operations.
Increase Commercial Volume. We have focused on continued expansion of our relationships with commercial insurers to increase our volume of patients with commercial insurance in our critical illness recovery hospitals. We believe that commercial payors seek to contract with our hospitals because we offer our patients high-quality, cost-effective care at more attractive rates than general acute care hospitals. We also offer commercial enrollees customized treatment programs not typically offered in general acute care hospitals.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network of critical illness recovery hospitals through opportunistic acquisitions. When we acquire a critical illness recovery hospital or a group of related facilities, a team of our professionals is responsible for formulating and executing an integration plan. We seek to improve financial performance at such facilities by adding clinical programs that attract commercial payors, centralizing administrative functions, and implementing our standardized resource management programs.
Rehabilitation Hospitals
Our rehabilitation hospitals provide comprehensive physical medicine, as well as rehabilitation programs and services, which serve to optimize patient health, function, and quality of life. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 30 rehabilitation hospitals in 12 states. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, approximately 50%, 47% and 49% respectively, of the revenue of our rehabilitation hospital segment came from Medicare reimbursement. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 11,700 people in our rehabilitation hospital segment, consisting primarily of registered nurses, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, neuropsychologists, and other psychologists.
Patients at our rehabilitation hospitals have specialized needs, with serious and often complex medical conditions requiring rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting. These conditions require targeted therapy and rehabilitation treatment, including comprehensive rehabilitative services for brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes, amputations, neurological disorders, orthopedic conditions, pediatric congenital or acquired disabilities, and cancer. Given their complex medical needs and gradual and prolonged recovery, these patients generally require a longer length of stay than patients in a general acute care hospital. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the average length of stay for patients in our rehabilitation hospitals was 14 days.
Additionally, we continually seek to increase our admissions by demonstrating our quality outcomes and, by doing so, expanding and improving our relationships with the physicians and general acute care hospitals in the markets where we operate. We maintain a strong focus on the provision of high-quality medical care within our facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 30 rehabilitation hospitals, all of which were accredited by TJC. Also as of December 31, 2021, all of our rehabilitation hospitals were certified as Medicare providers as inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”). 23 of our rehabilitation hospitals also received accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”), an independent, not-for-profit organization that establishes standards related to the operation of medical rehabilitation facilities. Each of our rehabilitation hospitals must regularly demonstrate to a survey team conformance to the applicable standards established by TJC, the Medicare program, or CARF, as applicable.
When a patient is referred to one of our rehabilitation hospitals by a physician, case manager, discharge planner, health maintenance organization, or insurance company, we perform a clinical assessment of the patient to determine if the patient meets criteria for admission. Based on the determinations reached in this clinical assessment, an admission decision is made.
Upon admission, an interdisciplinary team reviews a patient’s condition. The interdisciplinary team is composed of a number of clinicians and may include any or all of the following: an attending physician; a registered nurse; a physical, occupational, and speech therapist; a respiratory therapist; a dietitian; a pharmacist; and a case manager. Upon completion of an initial evaluation by each member of the treatment team, an individualized treatment plan is established and implemented. The case manager coordinates all aspects of the patient’s hospital stay and serves as a liaison with the insurance carrier’s case management staff when appropriate. The case manager communicates progress, resource utilization, and treatment goals between the patient, the treatment team, and the payor.
Each of our rehabilitation hospitals has a multi-specialty medical staff that is composed of physicians who have completed the privileging and credentialing process required by that rehabilitation hospital and have been approved by the governing board of that rehabilitation hospital. Physicians on the medical staff of our rehabilitation hospitals are generally not directly employed by our rehabilitation hospitals, but instead have staff privileges at one or more hospitals. At each of our rehabilitation hospitals, attending physicians conduct rounds on their patients on a regular basis and consulting physicians provide consulting services based on the medical needs of our patients. Our rehabilitation hospitals also have on-call arrangements with physicians to help ensure that a physician is available to care for our patients. We staff our rehabilitation hospitals with the number of physicians, therapists, and other medical practitioners that we believe is appropriate to address the varying needs of our patients. When determining the appropriate composition of the medical staff of a rehabilitation hospital, we consider the size of the rehabilitation hospital, services provided by the rehabilitation hospital, and, if applicable, the proximity of an acute care hospital to the free-standing rehabilitation hospital. The medical staff of each of our rehabilitation hospitals meets the applicable requirements set forth by Medicare, the facility’s applicable accrediting organizations, and the state in which that rehabilitation hospital is located.
Our rehabilitation hospital segment is led by a president, chief operating officer, chief medical officer, chief academic officer, chief nursing officer, and chief quality officer. Each of our rehabilitation hospitals has an onsite management team consisting of a chief executive officer, a medical director, a chief nursing officer, a director of therapy services, and a director of business development. These teams manage local strategy and day-to-day operations, including oversight of clinical care and treatment. They also assume primary responsibility for developing relationships with the general acute care providers and clinicians in the local areas we serve that refer patients to our rehabilitation hospitals. We provide our facilities within our rehabilitation hospital segment with centralized accounting, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, management information systems, and billing and collection services. The centralization of these services improves efficiency and permits the staff at our rehabilitation hospitals to focus their time on patient care.
For a description of government regulations and Medicare payments made to our rehabilitation hospitals, see “—Government Regulations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Rehabilitation Hospital Strategy
The key elements of our rehabilitation hospital strategy are to:
Focus on Specialized Inpatient Services. We serve patients with debilitating injuries and rehabilitation needs that cannot be adequately cared for in a less medically intensive environment, such as a skilled nursing facility. Generally, patients in our rehabilitation hospitals require longer stays and can benefit from more specialized and intensive clinical care than patients treated in general acute care hospitals and require more intensive therapy than that provided in outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. Our rehabilitation hospitals serve a critical role in comprehensive healthcare delivery. Through our specialized treatment programs and staffing models, we treat patients with complex and specialized medical needs. Our specialized treatment programs focus on specific patient needs and medical conditions, such as rehabilitation programs for brain trauma and spinal cord injuries. We also focus on specific programs of care designed to restore strength, improve physical and cognitive function, and promote independence in activities of daily living for patients who have suffered complications from strokes, amputations, cancer, and neurological and orthopedic conditions. Our staffing models seek to ensure that patients have the appropriate clinical resources over the course of their stay. We maintain quality assurance programs to support and monitor quality of care standards and to meet regulatory requirements and maintain Medicare certifications. We believe that we are recognized for providing quality care and service, which helps develop brand loyalty in the local areas we serve.
Our treatment programs, which are continuously reassessed and updated, benefit patients because they give our clinicians access to the best practices and protocols that we have found to be most effective in treating various conditions such as brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes, and neuromuscular disorders. In addition, we combine or modify these programs to provide a treatment plan tailored to meet our patients’ unique needs. We measure the outcomes and successes of our patients’ recovery in order to provide the best possible patient care and service.
Our rehabilitation hospitals demonstrated a critical role in caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our rehabilitation hospitals were and continue to be in a position to enhance and promote recovery of patients with COVID-19, as many patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 suffer from complex medical conditions and severe deconditioning. Our rehabilitation hospitals demonstrated rapid preparation and implementation of modifications that supported the treatment of active COVID-19 patients and patients recovering from moderate-to-severe response to COVID-19 infection. We have demonstrated that our rehabilitation hospitals can support short term acute care hospitals in regions as a post-ICU provider for patients who require specialized therapies while recovering from severe complications from COVID-19. 
The quality of the patient care we provide is continually monitored using several measures, including clinical outcomes data and analyses and patient satisfaction surveys. Quality metrics from our rehabilitation hospitals are used to create monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting for our leadership team. In order to benchmark ourselves against other hospitals, we collect our clinical and patient satisfaction information and compare it to national standards and the results of other healthcare organizations. We are required to report quality measures to individual states based on unique requirements and laws. We also submit required quality data elements to CMS. See “—Government Regulations—Other Medicare Regulations—Medicare Quality Reporting.”
Control Operating Costs. We continually seek to improve operating efficiency and control costs at our rehabilitation hospitals by standardizing operations and centralizing key administrative functions. These initiatives include:
•centralizing administrative functions such as accounting, finance, treasury, payroll, legal, operational support, human resources, compliance, and billing and collection;
•standardizing management information systems to assist in capturing the medical record, accounting, billing, collections, and data capture and analysis; and
•centralizing sourcing and contracting to receive discounted prices for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and other commodities used in our operations.
Increase Commercial Volume. We have focused on continued expansion of our relationships with commercial insurers to increase our volume of patients with commercial insurance in our rehabilitation hospitals. We believe that commercial payors seek to contract with our rehabilitation hospitals because we offer our patients high-quality, cost-effective care at more attractive rates than general acute care hospitals. We also offer commercial enrollees customized and comprehensive rehabilitation treatment programs not typically offered in general acute care hospitals.
Develop Rehabilitation Hospitals through Pursuing Joint Ventures with Large Healthcare Systems. By leveraging the experience of our senior management and development team, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our portfolio of joint ventured operations. When we identify joint venture opportunities, our development team conducts an extensive review of the area’s referral patterns and commercial insurance rates to determine the general reimbursement trends and payor mix. Once discussions commence with a healthcare system, we refine the specific needs of a joint venture, which could include working capital, the construction of new space, or the leasing and renovation of existing space. A joint venture typically consists of us and the healthcare system contributing certain post-acute care businesses into a newly formed entity. We typically function as the manager and hold either a majority or minority ownership interest. We bring clinical expertise and clinical programs that attract commercial payors and implement our standardized resource management programs, which may improve the clinical outcome and enhance the financial performance of the joint venture.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network of rehabilitation hospitals through opportunistic acquisitions. When we acquire a rehabilitation hospital or a group of related facilities, a team of our professionals is responsible for formulating and executing an integration plan. We seek to improve financial performance at such facilities by adding clinical programs that attract commercial payors, centralizing administrative functions, and implementing our standardized resource management programs.
Outpatient Rehabilitation
We are the largest operator of outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the United States based on number of facilities, with 1,881 facilities throughout 38 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2021. Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics are typically located in a medical complex or retail location. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment employed approximately 11,200 people as of December 31, 2021.
In our outpatient rehabilitation clinics, we provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation programs and services. We also provide certain specialized programs such as functional programs for work related injuries, hand therapy, post-concussion rehabilitation, pediatric rehabilitation, cancer rehabilitation, and athletic training services. In 2020, we developed and launched our national Recovery and Reconditioning program design to rehabilitate those patients suffering side effects from COVID-19. The typical patient in one of our outpatient rehabilitation clinics suffers from musculoskeletal impairments that restrict his or her ability to perform normal activities of daily living. These impairments are often associated with accidents, sports injuries, work related injuries, or post-operative orthopedic and other medical conditions. Our rehabilitation programs and services are designed to help these patients minimize physical and cognitive impairments and maximize functional ability. We also provide services designed to prevent short term disabilities from becoming chronic conditions. Our rehabilitation services are provided by our professionals including licensed physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists.
Outpatient rehabilitation patients are generally referred or directed to our clinics by a physician, employer, or health insurer who believes that a patient, employee, or member can benefit from the level of therapy we provide in an outpatient setting. Although individuals in all states may have some form of direct access to physical therapy services, the level of direct access varies based on provisions and limitations in each jurisdiction. In recent years, all states have enacted laws that allow individuals to seek outpatient physical rehabilitation services without a physician order. In our outpatient rehabilitation segment, for the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 82% of our revenue comes from commercial payors, including healthcare insurers, managed care organizations, workers’ compensation programs, contract management services, and private pay sources. We believe that our services are attractive to healthcare payors who are seeking to provide high-quality and cost-effective care to their enrollees. The balance of our reimbursement is derived from Medicare and other government sponsored programs.
For a description of government regulations and Medicare payments made to our outpatient rehabilitation services, see “—Government Regulations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Outpatient Rehabilitation Strategy
The key elements of our outpatient rehabilitation strategy are to:
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. We are focused on providing a high level of service to our patients throughout their entire course of treatment. We collect patient reported outcomes that allow us to assess each patient’s functional improvement. To measure satisfaction with our service we have developed surveys for both patients and physicians. Our clinics utilize the feedback from these surveys to continuously refine and improve service levels. We believe that by focusing on quality care and offering a high level of customer service we develop brand loyalty which allows us to strengthen our relationships with referring physicians, employers, and health insurers to drive additional patient volume. 
Increase Market Share. We strive to establish a leading presence within the local areas we serve. We use analytics to assess underserved needs in rehabilitation markets. We then target those areas for additional growth. To increase our presence, we seek to open new clinics in our existing markets. We have also entered into joint ventures with hospital systems that have resulted in an increase in the number of facilities that we operate. This allows us to realize economies of scale, heightened brand loyalty, and workforce continuity. We also focus on increasing our workers’ compensation and commercial/managed care payor mix. 
Expand Rehabilitation Programs and Services. Through our local clinical directors of operations and clinic managers within their service areas, we assess the healthcare needs of the areas we serve. Based on these assessments, we implement additional clinical programs and services (such as telehealth and home physical therapy) specifically targeted to meet demand in the local community. In designing these programs we benefit from the knowledge we gain through our national network of clinics. This knowledge is used to design programs that optimize treatment methods and measure changes in health status, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction.
Optimize Payor Contract Reimbursements. We review payor contracts scheduled for renewal and potential new payor contracts to assure reasonable reimbursements for the services we provide. Before we enter into a new contract with a commercial payor, we assess the reasonableness of the reimbursements by analyzing past and projected patient volume and clinic capacity. We create a retention strategy for the top performing contracts and a renegotiation strategy for contracts that do not meet our defined criteria. We believe that our national footprint and our strong reputation enable us to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates with commercial insurers.
Maintain Strong Community and Employee Relations. We believe that the relationships between our employees and the referral sources in their communities are critical to our success. Our referral sources, such as physicians and healthcare case managers, send their patients to our clinics based on three factors: the quality of our care, the customer service we provide, and their familiarity with our therapists. We seek to retain and motivate our therapists by implementing a performance-based bonus program, a defined career path with the ability to be promoted from within, timely communication on company developments, and internal training programs. We also focus on empowering our employees by giving them a high degree of autonomy in determining local area strategy. We seek to identify therapists who are potential business leaders. This management approach reflects the unique nature of each local area in which we operate and the importance of encouraging our employees to assume responsibility for their clinic’s financial and operational performance.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network of outpatient rehabilitation facilities through opportunistic acquisitions. We believe our size and centralized infrastructure allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies and improve financial performance at acquired facilities.
Concentra
We are the largest provider of occupational health services in the United States based on the number of facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 518 occupational health centers and 134 onsite clinics at employer worksites throughout 42 states. In some of our occupational health centers we also provide urgent care services. On September 1, 2020, Concentra sold its Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic (“CBOC”) business. We deliver occupational medicine, consumer health, physical therapy, and wellness services in our occupational health centers and our onsite clinics located at the workplaces of our employer customers. Our Concentra segment employed approximately 10,800 people as of December 31, 2021.
We offer a range of occupational and consumer health services through our occupational health centers and onsite clinics. Occupational health services include workers’ compensation injury care as well as employer services, clinical testing, wellness programs, and preventative care. Consumer health consists of non-employer, patient-directed treatment of injuries and illnesses. Our consumer health service offerings include urgent care, wellness programs, and preventative care.
Occupational medicine refers to the diagnosis and treatment of work-related injuries (workers’ compensation), compliance services, such as preventive services, including pre-employment, fitness-for-duty, and post-accident physical examinations and substance abuse screening. Utilization is driven by the needs of labor-intensive industries such as transportation, distribution/warehousing, manufacturing, construction, healthcare, police/fire, and other occupations that have historically posed a higher than average risk of workplace injury or that require a workplace physical. Workers’ compensation is the form of insurance that provides medical coverage to employees with work-related illnesses or injuries.
Workers’ compensation is administered on a state-by-state basis and each state is responsible for implementing and regulating its own workers’ compensation program. Because workers’ compensation benefits are mandated by law and subject to extensive regulation, insurers, third-party administrators, and employers do not have the same flexibility to alter benefits as they have with other health benefit programs. In addition, because programs vary by state, it is difficult for insurance companies and multi-state employers to adopt uniform policies to administer, manage, and control the costs of benefits across states. As a result, managing the cost of workers’ compensation requires approaches that are tailored to the specific regulatory environments in which the employer operates. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 56% of our Concentra segment revenue came from workers’ compensation payments.
Acquisition of Additional Membership Interests in Concentra Group Holdings Parent
In a series of transactions which culminated on December 24, 2021, Select acquired substantially all of the outstanding membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent that it did not already own from Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe XII, L.P. (“WCAS”), Dignity Health Holding Corporation (“DHHC”) and certain other sellers, in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion (the “Concentra Interest Purchases”), of which $660.7 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon consummation of the Concentra Interest Purchases, Select owns in the aggregate approximately 99.3% of the outstanding membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent on a fully diluted basis and 100.0% of the outstanding voting membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent.
Concentra Strategy
The key elements of our Concentra strategy are to:
Provide High-Quality Care and Service. We strive to provide a high level of service to our patients and our employer customers. We measure and monitor patient and employer satisfaction and focus on treatment programs to provide the best clinical outcomes in a consistent manner. Our programs and services have proven that aggressive treatment and management of workers injuries can more rapidly restore employees to better health which reduces workers’ compensation indemnity claim costs for our employer customers.
Focus on Occupational Medicine. Our history as an industry leader in the provision of occupational medicine services provides the platform for Concentra to grow this service offering. Complementary service offerings help drive additional growth in this business line.
Pursue Direct Employer Relationships. We believe we provide occupational health services in a cost-effective manner to our employer customers. By establishing direct relationships with these customers, we seek to reduce overall costs of their workers’ compensation claims, while improving employee health, and getting their employees back to work faster.
Increase Presence in the Areas We Serve. We strive to establish a strong presence within the local areas we serve. To increase our presence, we seek to expand our services and programs and to open new occupational health centers and employer onsite locations. This allows us to realize economies of scale, heightened brand loyalty, and workforce continuity.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We may grow our network and expand our geographic reach through opportunistic acquisitions. We believe our size and centralized infrastructure allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies and improve financial performance at acquired facilities.
Other
Other activities include our corporate administration and shared services, as well as employee leasing services with our non-consolidating subsidiaries. We also hold minority investments in other healthcare related businesses. These include investments in companies that provide specialized technology and services to healthcare entities, as well as providers of complementary services.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the success of our business model is based on a number of competitive strengths, including our position as a leading operator in each of our business segments, our proven financial performance, our strong cash flow, our significant scale, our experience in completing and integrating acquisitions, our partnerships with large healthcare systems, our ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, and our experienced management team.
Leading Operator in Distinct but Complementary Lines of Business. We believe that we are a leading operator in our business segments based on number of facilities in the United States. Our leadership position and reputation as a high-quality, cost-effective healthcare provider in each of our business segments allows us to attract patients and employees, aids us in our marketing efforts to referral sources, and helps us negotiate payor contracts. In our critical illness recovery hospital segment, we operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals in 28 states as of December 31, 2021. In our rehabilitation hospital segment, we operated 30 rehabilitation hospitals in 12 states as of December 31, 2021. In our outpatient rehabilitation segment, we operated 1,881 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 38 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2021. In our Concentra segment, we operated 518 occupational health centers in 41 states as of December 31, 2021. With these leading positions in the areas we serve, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from the rising demand for medical services due to an aging population in the United States, which will drive growth across our business segments.
Proven Financial Performance and Strong Cash Flow. We have established a track record of improving the financial performance of our facilities due to our disciplined approach to revenue growth, expense management, and focus on free cash flow generation. This includes regular review of specific financial metrics of our business to determine trends in our revenue generation, expenses, billing, and cash collection. Based on the ongoing analysis of such trends, we make adjustments to our operations to optimize our financial performance and cash flow.
Significant Scale. By building significant scale in each of our business segments, we have been able to leverage our operating costs by centralizing administrative functions at our corporate office.
Experience in Successfully Completing and Integrating Acquisitions.  Since our inception in 1997 through 2021, we completed ten significant acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Physiotherapy, Concentra, and U.S. HealthWorks. We believe that we have improved the operating performance of these businesses over time by applying our standard operating practices and by realizing efficiencies from our centralized operations and management.
Experience in Partnering with Large Healthcare Systems. Over the past several years we have partnered with large healthcare systems to provide post-acute care services. We believe that we provide operating expertise to these ventures through our experience in operating critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and outpatient rehabilitation facilities and have improved and expanded the level of post-acute care services provided in these communities, as well as the financial performance of these operations.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Acquisition Opportunities. We are well-positioned to pursue selective acquisitions within each of our business segments to augment our internal growth. Many of the nation’s critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and occupational health centers are operated by independent operators lacking national or broad regional scope. We believe that our geographically diversified portfolio of facilities provide us with a footprint to strengthen and grow our businesses in the markets we operate and in new markets that need the services we provide.
Experienced and Proven Management Team. Prior to co-founding our company with our current Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, our Vice Chairman and Co-Founder founded and operated three other healthcare companies focused on inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. The other members of our senior management team also have extensive experience in the healthcare industry, with an average of almost 25 years in the business. In recent years, we have reorganized our operations to expand executive talent and promote management continuity.

Government Sources
Medicare is a federal program that provides medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state funded program, administered by the states, which provides medical benefits to individuals who are unable to afford healthcare. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 104 critical illness recovery hospitals, all of which were certified by Medicare as LTCHs. Also as of December 31, 2021, we operated 30 rehabilitation hospitals, all of which were certified by Medicare as IRFs. Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics regularly receive Medicare payments for their services. Additionally, many of our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals participate in state Medicaid programs. Amounts received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally less than the customary charges for the services provided. In recent years, there have been significant changes made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since a significant portion of our revenues come from patients covered under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in the Medicare program. See “—Government Regulations—Overview of U.S. and State Government Reimbursements.”
Non-Government Sources
Our non-government sources of revenue include insurance companies, workers’ compensation programs, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, other managed care companies, and employers, as well as patients directly. 
Human Capital Management
Overview
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 50,500 employees, including approximately 35,900 full-time and 14,600 part-time and per-diem employees. Our critical illness recovery hospital segment employees totaled approximately 14,500, rehabilitation hospital segment employees totaled approximately 11,700, outpatient rehabilitation segment employees totaled approximately 11,200, and Concentra segment employees totaled approximately 10,800. Approximately 2,300 of the remaining employees performed corporate management, administration, and other support services primarily at our Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania headquarters.
Our workforce is predominantly non-union, with less than 50 employees represented by one labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good and believe that our employees are essential contributors to our success. In some markets, the shortage of clinical personnel is a significant operating issue facing healthcare providers. Shortages of nurses and other clinical personnel, including therapists, may, from time to time, require us to increase use of more costly temporary personnel, which we refer to as “contract labor,” and other types of premium pay programs.
Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who are usually not employed by us. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. Within our hospital divisions, approximately 12,000 physicians are credentialed to treat and provide services to our patients. In addition, some physicians or group practices provide administrative and/or clinical services in our hospitals under contracts.
Select Medical developed a cultural framework we call “The Select Medical Way.” One of the key tenants of this framework is to deliver a superior employee experience. We devote considerable time and resources to attract, engage and retain talented employees to successfully operate our business and achieve our goals. Each of the key areas on which we focus to achieve our human capital objectives is described below. 
Talent Acquisition and Retention
We have several key strategies to attract and hire top talent across the markets that we serve. These strategies include robust employee referral programs, recruitment marketing through social media and our internal campaign technology, promotion of virtual hiring events and partnering with local nursing schools for clinical rotations and new graduate nursing and therapy programs. Our recruitment and selection processes seek to ensure that we hire employees who have the level of education, experience and professional licensure that align with the organization’s strategic objectives. We have developed several programs to advance technical and clinical skills, enable career growth and improve retention for clinical and operational employees. Using our online platform, we have developed an extensive catalog of online learning classes for both instructor-led and asynchronous learning covering technical, professional and management-related topics. In addition, to promote business continuity, we create specific succession plans for our key operational and support management and executive positions. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to foster a culture of inclusion and equality. Our employees and patients are a valued and integral part of our organization, and we stand in solidarity with those who respect and share our values, care for others and condemn racism. We are committed to providing regular employee education and training on respect, equality, empathy and compassion, and we evaluate and update these resources on an ongoing basis. Additionally, any agency or contracted individual working within our facilities receives orientation and training on our expectations and standards for care. We take pride in our recruitment efforts that seek to attract the best and brightest talent from around the country. We are committed to having a workforce that reflects diversity at all levels, and we partner with several organizations to help attract diverse talent. In order to help us achieve these goals, we have established a diversity task force that oversees affirmative action planning and provides strategic recommendations to help ensure our goals for a diverse and inclusive workplace remain robust and actionable.
Employee Engagement and Wellness
We demonstrate our care for our employees through our safety, benefit and employee resource programs. We strive to create and sustain a culture of employee safety in each of our facilities. 
We have emphasized, particularly within our critical illness recovery hospital and inpatient rehabilitation segments, a communications tool called the “10-Foot Circle of Employee Safety.” This tool is meant to help leaders and staff focus on areas of our work which cause workplace injuries. This program has resulted in significant reductions of employee injuries at work. We have also implemented an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) which has become a valuable resource for employees needing no cost or low cost counseling/mental health services, legal support, or family assistance. Our EAP provides access to resources for individuals dealing with grief, anxiety, and other concerns relevant to and at the forefront of our communities. We offer robust benefit programming with health coaching on diverse topics like weight management, smoking cessation, and maintaining and improving health goals, and we offer training to our employees to help them develop their skills. We utilize surveys of our employees that are focused on areas such as employee engagement, operational reliability and suggestions for improvement. Additionally, we offer extensive supportive programs to individuals facing serious health concerns, including but not limited to, high blood pressure/heart conditions, diabetes and cancer.
Workforce Compensation and Pay Equity
We provide competitive compensation and benefits, including a retirement savings plan with matching opportunities, comprehensive healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off and family leave. We have key processes that seek to ensure our pay and benefits remain competitive across all of our disciplines. Using an electronic platform for both performance reviews and compensation review, each employee’s performance assessment and compensation go through multiple layers of review annually to promote equitable, market competitive and performance-based compensation. For external benchmarking, we use third party commercially available compensation surveys, as well as the Department of Labor wage data. 
Select Medical Charitable Foundation
We have operated a private, non-profit charitable foundation known as the Select Medical Charitable Foundation since 2004. The Foundation is funded primarily by donations by our employees. The Foundation provides financial assistance to employees significantly impacted by natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires. Eligibility is application-based with grant distribution determined by the Foundation Review Committee, comprised of colleagues across the organization.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Our industry has been on the front line in the battle against COVID-19. This has resulted in a high demand for registered nurses and respiratory therapists, which in turn has placed increased pressure on the importance of recruiting and retaining high quality employees. We have taken several steps in response to these demands to achieve our human capital objectives, such as base rate of pay increases and increasing incentives for staff in markets that have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and providing a meaningful amount of paid time off for employees who cannot work for COVID-19 related reasons. 
Competition
Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals and Rehabilitation Hospitals 
Our critical illness recovery hospitals and our rehabilitation hospitals both compete on the basis of the quality of the patient services we provide, the outcomes we achieve for our patients, and the prices we charge for our services. The primary competitive factors in both of our critical illness recovery hospital and rehabilitation hospital segments include quality of services, charges for services, and responsiveness to the needs of patients, families, payors, and physicians. Other companies operate critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals that compete with our own hospitals, including large operators of similar facilities, such as ScionHealth and Encompass Health Corporation, and rehabilitation units and step-down units operated by acute care hospitals in the markets we serve. The competitive position of a critical illness recovery hospital or a rehabilitation hospital is also affected by the ability of its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, managed care companies, preferred provider organizations, and health maintenance organizations. Such organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established critical illness recovery hospital or rehabilitation hospital charges. The importance of obtaining contracts with preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other organizations which finance healthcare, and its effect on a critical illness recovery hospital’s or rehabilitation hospital’s competitive position, vary from area to area depending on the number and strength of such organizations.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinics
Our outpatient rehabilitation clinics face a highly fragmented and competitive environment. The primary competitors that provide outpatient rehabilitation services include physician-owned physical therapy clinics, dedicated locally owned and managed outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and hospital or university owned or affiliated ventures, as well as national and regional providers in select areas, including Athletico Physical Therapy, ATI Physical Therapy, U.S. Physical Therapy, and Upstream Rehabilitation. Some of these competing clinics have longer operating histories and greater name recognition in these communities than our clinics, and they may have stronger relations with physicians in these communities on whom we rely for patient referrals. Because the barriers to entry are not substantial and current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, we believe that new outpatient physical therapy competitors can emerge relatively quickly.
Concentra
Our Concentra segment’s occupational health services and consumer health businesses face a highly fragmented and competitive environment. The primary competitors that provide occupational health services have typically been independent physicians, hospital emergency departments, and hospital-owned or hospital-affiliated medical facilities. Because the barriers to entry are not substantial and Concentra’s current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, we believe that new competitors to Concentra can emerge relatively quickly. Furthermore, urgent care clinics in the local communities Concentra serves provide services similar to those Concentra offers, and, in some cases, competing facilities are more established or newer than Concentra’s, may offer a broader array of services to patients than Concentra’s, and may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to treat and serve patients. 
Government Regulations
General
The healthcare industry is required to comply with many complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. These laws and regulations require that hospitals and facilities furnishing outpatient services (including outpatient rehabilitation clinics, Concentra occupational health centers and onsite clinics) comply with various requirements and standards. These laws and regulations include those relating to the adequacy of medical care, facilities and equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and recordkeeping, as well as standards for reimbursement, fraud and abuse prevention, and health information privacy and security. These laws and regulations are extremely complex, often overlap and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs.
Facility Licensure
Our healthcare facilities are subject to state and local licensing statutes and regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. In order to assure continued compliance with these various regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our facilities, both at scheduled intervals and in response to complaints from patients and others. While our facilities intend to comply with existing licensing standards, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given time. In addition, the state and local licensing laws are subject to changes or new interpretations that could impose additional burdens on our facilities. A determination by an applicable regulatory authority that a facility is not in compliance with these requirements could lead to the imposition of corrective action, assessment of fines and penalties, or loss of licensure, Medicare enrollment, certification or accreditation. These consequences could have an adverse effect on our company.
Some states require us to get approval under certificate of need regulations when we create, acquire, or expand our facilities or services, or alter the ownership of such facilities, whether directly or indirectly. The certificate of need regulations vary from state to state, and are subject to change and new interpretation. If we fail to show public need and obtain approval in these states for our new facilities or changes to the ownership structure of existing facilities, we may be subject to civil or even criminal penalties, lose our facility license, or become ineligible for reimbursement.
Professional Licensure, Corporate Practice and Fee-Splitting Laws
Healthcare professionals at our critical illness recovery hospitals, our rehabilitation hospitals, and our facilities furnishing outpatient services are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law. We take steps to help ensure our employees and agents possess all necessary licenses and certifications.
Some states prohibit the “corporate practice of medicine,” which restricts business corporations from practicing medicine through the direct employment of physicians or from exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. Some states similarly prohibit the “corporate practice of therapy.” The laws relating to corporate practice vary from state to state and are not fully developed in each state in which we have facilities. Typically, however, professional corporations owned and controlled by licensed professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ physicians or therapists to furnish professional services. Also, in some states, hospitals are permitted to employ physicians.
Some states also prohibit entities from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians or therapists. The laws relating to fee-splitting also vary from state to state and are not fully developed. Generally, these laws restrict business arrangements that involve a physician or therapist sharing medical fees with a referral source, but in some states these laws have been interpreted to extend to management agreements between physicians or therapists and business entities under some circumstances.
We believe that each of our facilities, licensed physicians, and therapists comply with any current corporate practice and fee-splitting laws of the state in which they are located. In states where we are prohibited by the corporate practice of medicine from directly employing licensed physicians, we typically enter into management agreements with professional corporations that are owned by licensed physicians, which, in turn, employ or contract with physicians who provide professional medical services in our facilities. Under those management agreements, we perform only non-medical administrative services, do not exercise control over the practice of medicine by the physicians, and structure compensation to avoid fee-splitting. In those states that apply the corporate practice of therapy prohibition, we either contract to obtain therapy services from an entity permitted to employ therapists or we manage the physical therapy practice owned by licensed therapists through which the therapy services are provided.
Although we believe that our facilities comply with corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, if new regulations or judicial or administrative interpretations establish that our facilities do not comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil and perhaps criminal penalties. In addition, if any of our facilities is determined not to comply with corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, certain of our agreements relating to the facility may be determined to be unenforceable, including our management agreements with the professional corporations furnishing physician services or our payment arrangements with insurers or employers. Future interpretations of corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, the enactment of new legislation, or the adoption of new regulations relating to these laws could cause us to have to restructure our business operations or close our facilities in a particular state. Any such penalties, determinations of unenforceability, or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Medicare Enrollment and Certification
In order to participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare reimbursement, each facility must comply with the applicable regulations of the United States Department of Health and Human Services relating to, among other things, the type of facility, its equipment, its personnel, and its standards of medical care, as well as compliance with all applicable state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2021, all of the critical illness recovery hospitals we operated were certified by Medicare as LTCHs. As of December 31, 2021, all of the rehabilitation hospitals we operated were certified by Medicare as IRFs. In addition, we provide the majority of our outpatient rehabilitation services through outpatient rehabilitation clinics certified by Medicare as rehabilitation agencies or “rehab agencies,” which operate as outpatient rehabilitation providers for the purposes of the Medicare program. Our Concentra occupational health centers furnishing outpatient services are generally enrolled in Medicare as suppliers.
Accreditation
Our critical illness recovery hospitals and our rehabilitation hospitals receive accreditation from TJC, DNV, CIHQ and/or CARF. As of December 31, 2021, all of the 104 critical illness recovery hospitals and all of the 30 rehabilitation hospitals we operated were accredited by TJC, DNV, or CIHQ. In addition, 23 of our rehabilitation hospitals have also received accreditation from CARF. 
Workers’ Compensation
Workers’ compensation is a state mandated, comprehensive insurance program that requires employers to fund or insure medical expenses, lost wages, and other costs resulting from work related injuries and illnesses. Workers’ compensation benefits and arrangements vary from state to state, and are often highly complex. In some states, payment for services covered by workers’ compensation programs are subject to cost containment features, such as requirements that all workers’ compensation injuries be treated through a managed care program, or the imposition of fee schedules or payment caps for services furnished to injured employees. Some state workers’ compensation laws limit the ability of an employer to select the providers furnishing care to injured employees. Several states require that physicians furnishing non-emergency services to workers’ compensation patients must register with the applicable state agency and undergo special continuing education and training. Workers’ compensation programs may also impose other requirements that affect the operations of our facilities furnishing outpatient services. Revenue generated directly from workers’ compensation programs represented approximately 56% of our revenue from our Concentra segment, 16% of our revenue from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, 1% of our revenue from our critical illness recovery hospital segment, and 2% of our revenue from our rehabilitation hospital segment for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our facilities furnishing outpatient services are reimbursed for services furnished to injured workers by payors pursuant to the applicable state workers’ compensation statutes. Most of the states in which we maintain operations reimburse providers for services payable under workers’ compensation laws pursuant to a treatment-specific fee schedule with established maximum reimbursement levels. In states without such fee schedules, healthcare providers are often reimbursed based on “usual and customary” fees benchmarked by market data and negotiated by providers with payors and networks.
Inadequate increases to the applicable fee schedule amounts for our services, and changes in state workers’ compensation laws, including cost containment initiatives, could have a negative impact on the operations and financial performance of those facilities.
Overview of U.S. and State Government Reimbursements
Medicare Program in General
The Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, which are generally persons age 65 and older, those who are chronically disabled, and those suffering from end stage renal disease. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 and is administered primarily by the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS. The table below shows the percentage of revenue generated directly from the Medicare program for each of our segments and our company as a whole for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
Medicare Revenue by Segment | 2019 | | 2020 | | 2021
Critical illness recovery hospital | 49.4 | % | | 43.3 | % | 37.1 | %
Rehabilitation hospital | 49.6 | % | | 47.0 | % | 48.6 | %
Outpatient rehabilitation | 16.4 | % | | 14.9 | % | 15.9 | %
Concentra | 0.1 | % | | 0.1 | % | 0.1 | %
Total Company | 25.9 | % | | 25.0 | % | 22.9 | %

The Medicare program reimburses various types of providers, including LTCHs, IRFs, and outpatient rehabilitation providers, using different payment methodologies. The Medicare reimbursement systems specific to LTCHs, IRFs, and outpatient rehabilitation providers, as described herein, are different than the system applicable to general acute care hospitals. If any of our hospitals fail to comply with requirements for payment under Medicare reimbursement systems for LTCHs or IRFs, as applicable, that hospital will be paid under the system applicable to general acute care hospitals. For general acute care hospitals, Medicare payments for inpatient care are made under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”) under which a hospital receives a fixed payment amount per discharge (adjusted for area wage differences) using Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (“MS-DRGs”). The general acute care hospital MS-DRG payment rate is based upon the national average cost of treating a Medicare patient’s condition, based on severity levels of illness, in that type of facility. Although the average length of stay varies for each MS-DRG, the average stay of all Medicare patients in a general acute care hospital is substantially less than the average length of stay in LTCHs and IRFs. Thus, the prospective payment system for general acute care hospitals creates an economic incentive for those hospitals to discharge medically complex Medicare patients to a post-acute care setting as soon as clinically possible. Effective October 1, 2005, CMS expanded its post-acute care transfer policy under which general acute care hospitals are paid on a per diem basis rather than the full MS-DRG rate if a patient is discharged early to certain post-acute care settings, including LTCHs and IRFs. When a patient is discharged from selected MS-DRGs to, among other providers, an LTCH or IRF, the general acute care hospital may be reimbursed below the full MS-DRG payment if the patient’s length of stay is at least one day less than the geometric mean length of stay for the MS-DRG.
Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services
The Medicare payment system for LTCHs is based on a prospective payment system specifically applicable to LTCHs (“LTCH-PPS”). The policies and payment rates under LTCH-PPS are subject to annual updates and revisions. Under LTCH-PPS, each patient discharged from an LTCH is assigned to a distinct “MS-LTC-DRG,” which is a Medicare severity long-term care diagnosis-related group for LTCHs, and an LTCH is generally paid a pre-determined fixed amount applicable to the assigned MS-LTC-DRG (adjusted for area wage differences), subject to exceptions for short stay and high cost outlier patients (described below). CMS assigns relative weights to each MS-LTC-DRG to reflect their relative use of medical care resources. The payment amount for each MS-LTC-DRG is intended to reflect the average cost of treating a Medicare patient assigned to that MS-LTC-DRG in an LTCH.
Standard Federal Rate
Payment under the LTCH-PPS is dependent on determining the patient classification, that is, the assignment of the case to a particular MS-LTC-DRG, the weight of the MS-LTC-DRG, and the standard federal payment rate. There is a single standard federal rate that encompasses both the inpatient operating costs, which includes a labor and non-labor component, and capital-related costs that CMS updates on an annual basis. LTCH-PPS also includes special payment policies that adjust the payments for some patients based on the patient’s length of stay, the facility’s costs, whether the patient was discharged and readmitted, and other factors.
Patient Criteria
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, enacted December 26, 2013, established a dual-rate LTCH-PPS for Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH. Specifically, for Medicare patients discharged in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, LTCHs are reimbursed at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate only if, immediately preceding the patient’s LTCH admission, the patient was discharged from a “subsection (d) hospital” (generally, a short-term acute care hospital paid under IPPS) and either the patient’s stay included at least three days in an intensive care unit or coronary care unit at the subsection (d) hospital, or the patient was assigned to an MS-LTC-DRG for cases receiving at least 96 hours of ventilator services in the LTCH. In addition, to be paid at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate, the patient’s discharge from the LTCH may not include a principal diagnosis relating to psychiatric or rehabilitation services. For any Medicare patient who does not meet these criteria, the LTCH will be paid a “site-neutral” payment rate, which will be the lower of: (i) the IPPS comparable per-diem payment rate capped at the MS-DRG payment rate plus any outlier payments; or (ii) 100 percent of the estimated costs for services.
The site neutral payment rate for those patients not paid at the LTCH-PPS standard federal payment rate is subject to a transition period. During the transition period (applicable to hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2019), a blended rate was paid for Medicare patients not meeting the new criteria that is equal to 50% of the site neutral payment rate amount and 50% of the standard federal payment rate amount. For discharges in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, only the site neutral payment rate will apply for Medicare patients not meeting the new criteria. For hospital discharges beginning on or after October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2026, the IPPS comparable per diem payment amount (including any applicable outlier payment) used to determine the site neutral payment rate is reduced by 4.6% after any annual payment rate update.
In addition, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, LTCHs must maintain an “LTCH discharge payment percentage” of at least 50% to continue to be reimbursed for Medicare fee-for-service patients at the dual rates of the LTCH-PPS. The “LTCH discharge payment percentage” is a ratio, expressed as a percentage, of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) discharges not paid the site neutral payment rate (i.e., those meeting LTCH patient criteria) to the total number of Medicare FFS discharges occurring during the cost reporting period. If this percentage is lower than 50%, the LTCH is notified that all of its Medicare FFS discharges will be subject to payment adjustment beginning in the cost reporting period after it was notified. The payment adjustment will result in reimbursement at an IPPS equivalent payment rate. However, the LTCH will not be subject to this payment adjustment if it maintains an LTCH discharge payment percentage of at least 50% during a 6-month “probationary-cure period” immediately before the cost reporting period when the payment adjustment would apply, and during that cost reporting period. An LTCH that has been subject to this payment adjustment will be reinstated at the regular dual rates of the LTCH-PPS in the cost reporting period that begins after the LTCH is notified that its LTCH discharge payment percentage is at least 50%.
Payment adjustments, including the interrupted stay policy (discussed herein), apply to LTCH discharges regardless of whether the case is paid at the standard federal payment rate or the site-neutral payment rate. However, short stay outlier payment adjustments do not apply to cases paid at the site-neutral payment rate. CMS calculates the annual recalibration of the MS-LTC-DRG relative payment weighting factors using only data from LTCH discharges that meet the criteria for exclusion from the site-neutral payment rate. In addition, CMS applies the IPPS fixed-loss amount for high cost outliers to site-neutral cases, rather than the LTCH-PPS fixed-loss amount. CMS calculates the LTCH-PPS fixed-loss amount using only data from cases paid at the LTCH-PPS payment rate, excluding cases paid at the site-neutral rate.
Short Stay Outlier Policy
CMS established a different payment methodology for Medicare patients with a length of stay less than or equal to five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay for that particular MS-LTC-DRG, referred to as a short stay outlier (“SSO”). SSO cases are paid based on a per diem rate derived from blending 120% of the MS-LTC-DRG specific per diem amount with a per diem rate based on the general acute care hospital IPPS. Under this policy, as the length of stay of a SSO case increases, the percentage of the per diem payment amounts based on the full MS-LTCH-DRG standard federal payment rate increases and the percentage of the payment based on the IPPS comparable amount decreases.
High Cost Outliers
Some cases are extraordinarily costly, producing losses that may be too large for hospitals to offset. Cases with unusually high costs, referred to as “high cost outliers,” receive a payment adjustment to reflect the additional resources utilized. CMS provides an additional payment if the estimated costs for the patient exceed the adjusted MS-LTC-DRG payment plus a fixed-loss amount that is established in the annual payment rate update.
Interrupted Stays
An interrupted stay is defined as a case in which an LTCH patient, upon discharge, is admitted to a general acute care hospital, IRF or skilled nursing facility/swing-bed and then returns to the same LTCH within a specified period of time. If the length of stay at the receiving provider is equal to or less than the applicable fixed period of time, it is considered to be an interrupted stay case and the case is treated as a single discharge for the purposes of payment to the LTCH. For interrupted stays of three days or less, Medicare payments for any test, procedure, or care provided to an LTCH patient on an outpatient basis or for any inpatient treatment during the “interruption” would be the responsibility of the LTCH.
Freestanding, HIH, and Satellite LTCHs
LTCHs may be organized and operated as freestanding facilities or as HIHs. As its name suggests, a freestanding LTCH is not located on the campus of another hospital. For such purpose, “campus” means the physical area immediately adjacent to a hospital’s main buildings, other areas, and structures that are not strictly contiguous to a hospital’s main buildings but are located within 250 yards of its main buildings, and any other areas determined, on an individual case basis by the applicable CMS regional office, to be part of a hospital’s campus. Conversely, an HIH is an LTCH that is located on the campus of another hospital. An LTCH, whether freestanding or an HIH, that uses the same Medicare provider number of an affiliated “primary site” LTCH is known as a “satellite.” Under Medicare policy, a satellite LTCH generally must be located within 35 miles of its primary site LTCH and be administered by such primary site LTCH. A primary site LTCH may have more than one satellite LTCH. CMS sometimes refers to a satellite LTCH that is freestanding as a “remote location.” LTCH HIHs and satellites must comply with  certain requirements to show that they operate as part of the main LTCH, and not the co-located hospital. Most or all of these requirements no longer apply to LTCHs that are located on the same campus as an IRF, an inpatient psychiatric facility, or any other hospital excluded from the IPPS, provided that an IPPS hospital is not also located on that campus.
Facility Certification Criteria
The LTCH-PPS regulations define the criteria that must be met in order for a hospital to be certified as an LTCH. To be eligible for payment under the LTCH-PPS, a hospital must be primarily engaged in providing inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries with medically complex conditions that require a long hospital stay. In addition, by definition, LTCHs must meet certain facility criteria, including: (i) instituting a review process that screens patients for appropriateness of an admission and validates the patient criteria within 48 hours of each patient’s admission, evaluates regularly their patients for continuation of care, and assesses the available discharge options; (ii) having active physician involvement with patient care that includes a physician available on-site daily and additional consulting physicians on call; and (iii) having an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals to prepare and carry out an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
An LTCH must have an average inpatient length of stay for Medicare patients (including both Medicare covered and non-covered days) of greater than 25 days. LTCH cases paid at the site-neutral rate and Medicare Advantage cases are excluded from the LTCH average length of stay calculation. LTCHs that fail to exceed an average length of stay of 25 days during any cost reporting period may be paid under the general acute care hospital IPPS if not corrected within established time frames. CMS, through its contractors, determines whether an LTCH has maintained an average length of stay of greater than 25 days during each annual cost reporting period.
Prior to qualifying under the payment system applicable to LTCHs, a new LTCH initially receives payments under the general acute care hospital IPPS. The LTCH must continue to be paid under this system for a minimum of six months while meeting certain Medicare LTCH requirements, the most significant requirement being an average length of stay for Medicare patients (including both Medicare covered and non-covered days) greater than 25 days.
Annual Payment Rate Update
Fiscal Year 2020. On August 16, 2019, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2020 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published October 8, 2019. The standard federal rate was set at $42,678, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2019 of $41,559. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2020 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.4%. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.0020203. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $26,778, a decrease from the fixed-loss amount in the 2019 fiscal year of $27,121. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $26,552, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2019 fiscal year of $25,743. For LTCH discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2020, site neutral payment rate cases began to be paid fully on the site neutral payment rate, rather than the transitional blended rate. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) waived the site neutral payment rate for patients admitted during the COVID-19 emergency period and in response to the public health emergency, as discussed below.
Fiscal Year 2021. On September 18, 2020, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2021 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published December 7, 2020. The standard federal rate was set at $43,755, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2020 of $42,678. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2021 included a market basket increase of 2.3% with no productivity adjustment. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.0016837. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $27,195, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2020 fiscal year of $26,778. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $29,064, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2020 fiscal year of $26,552.
Fiscal Year 2022. On August 13, 2021, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2022 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022). The standard federal rate was set at $44,714, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2021 of $43,755. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2022 included a market basket increase of 2.6%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.7%. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.002848. As a result of the CARES Act, all LTCH cases are paid at the standard federal rate during the public health emergency. If the public health emergency ends during fiscal year 2022, then CMS will return to using the site-neutral payment rate for reimbursement of cases that do not meet the LTCH patient criteria. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $33,015, a significant increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2021 fiscal year of $27,195. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $30,988, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2021 fiscal year of $29,064.
Medicare Reimbursement of IRF Services
IRFs are paid under a prospective payment system specifically applicable to this provider type, which is referred to as “IRF-PPS.” Under the IRF-PPS, each patient discharged from an IRF is assigned to a case mix group (“IRF-CMG”) containing patients with similar clinical conditions that are expected to require similar amounts of resources. An IRF is generally paid a pre-determined fixed amount applicable to the assigned IRF-CMG (subject to applicable case adjustments related to length of stay and facility level adjustments for location and low income patients). The payment amount for each IRF-CMG is intended to reflect the average cost of treating a Medicare patient’s condition in an IRF relative to patients with conditions described by other IRF-CMGs. The IRF-PPS also includes special payment policies that adjust the payments for some patients based on the patient’s length of stay, the facility’s costs, whether the patient was discharged and readmitted and other factors.
Facility Certification Criteria
Our rehabilitation hospitals must meet certain facility criteria to be classified as an IRF by the Medicare program, including: (i) a provider agreement to participate as a hospital in Medicare; (ii) a pre-admission screening procedure; (iii) ensuring that patients receive close medical supervision and furnish, through the use of qualified personnel, rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, plus, as needed, speech therapy, social or psychological services, and orthotic and prosthetic services; (iv) a full-time, qualified director of rehabilitation; (v) a plan of treatment for each inpatient that is established, reviewed, and revised as needed by a physician in consultation with other professional personnel who provide services to the patient; and (vi) a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach in the rehabilitation of each inpatient, as documented by periodic clinical entries made in the patient’s medical record to note the patient’s status in relationship to goal attainment, and that team conferences are held at least every two weeks to determine the appropriateness of treatment. Failure to comply with any of the classification criteria may result in the denial of claims for payment or cause a hospital to lose its status as an IRF and be paid under the prospective payment system that applies to general acute care hospitals.
Patient Classification Criteria
In order to qualify as an IRF, a hospital must demonstrate that during its most recent 12-month cost reporting period, it served an inpatient population of whom at least 60% required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 conditions specified by regulation. Compliance with the 60% Rule is demonstrated through either medical review or the “presumptive” method, in which a patient’s diagnosis codes are compared to a “presumptive compliance” list. Beginning October 1, 2017, the 60% Rule’s presumptive methodology was revised to (i) include certain International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (“ICD-10-CM”) diagnosis codes for patients with traumatic brain injury and hip fracture conditions and (ii) count IRF cases that contain two or more of the ICD-10-CM codes from three major multiple trauma lists in the specified combinations.
Annual Payment Rate Update
Fiscal Year 2020. On August 8, 2019, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2020 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2020 was set at $16,489, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2019 of $16,021. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2020 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.4%. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2020 to $9,300 from $9,402 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2019.
Fiscal Year 2021. On August 10, 2020, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2021 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2021 was set at $16,856, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2020 of $16,489. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2021 included a market basket increase of 2.4% with no productivity adjustment. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2021 to $7,906 from $9,300 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2020.
Fiscal Year 2022. On August 4, 2021, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2022 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2022 was set at $17,240, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2021 of $16,856. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2022 included a market basket increase of 2.6%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.7%. CMS increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2022 to $9,491 from $7,906 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2021.
Medicare Reimbursement of Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinic Services
Outpatient rehabilitation providers enroll in Medicare as a rehabilitation agency, a clinic, or a public health agency. The Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare physician fee schedule. For services provided in 2017 through 2019, a 0.5% update was applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to an adjustment beginning in 2019 under the Merit‑Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”). In 2019, CMS added physical and occupational therapists to the list of MIPS eligible clinicians. For these therapists in private practice, payments under the fee schedule are subject to adjustment in a later year based on their performance in MIPS according to established performance standards. Calendar year 2021 is the first year that payments are adjusted, based upon the therapist’s performance under MIPS in 2019. Providers in facility-based outpatient therapy settings are excluded from MIPS eligibility and therefore not subject to this payment adjustment.
For services provided in 2020 through 2025, a 0.0% percent update will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to adjustments under MIPS and the alternative payment models (“APMs”). In 2026 and subsequent years, eligible professionals participating in APMs who meet certain criteria would receive annual updates of 0.75%, while all other professionals would receive annual updates of 0.25%. Each year from 2019 through 2024 eligible clinicians who receive a significant share of their revenues through an advanced APM (such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements) that involves risk of financial losses and a quality measurement component will receive a 5% bonus. The bonus payment for APM participation is intended to encourage participation and testing of new APMs and to promote the alignment of incentives across payors.
In the 2020 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, CMS revised coding, documentation guidelines, and increased the valuation for the evaluation and management (“E/M”) office visit codes, beginning in 2021. Because the Medicare physician fee schedule is budget-neutral, any revaluation of E/M services that will increase spending by more than $20 million will require a budget neutrality adjustment. To increase values for the E/M codes while maintaining budget neutrality under the fee schedule, CMS cut the values of other codes to make up the difference, beginning in 2021. In the 2021 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, CMS increased the values for the E/M office visit codes and cuts to other specialty codes to maintain budget neutrality. As a result, therapy services provided in our outpatient rehabilitation clinics received an estimated 3.6% decrease in payment from Medicare in calendar year 2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, provided relief in the form of a one-time 3.75% increase in payments in calendar year 2021 for therapy services and other services paid under the physician fee schedule. 
In the calendar year 2022 physician fee schedule final rule, CMS announced that Medicare payments for the therapy specialty are expected to decrease 1% in 2022. After CMS issued the final rule, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which provided in Section 3 a one-time 3% increase in payments in calendar year 2022 to offset most of the 3.75% cut to payments for therapy services and other services paid under the physician fee schedule. In the final rule, CMS also adopted its plan to transition the MIPS program to MIPS Value Pathways (“MVPs”). CMS will begin the transition to MVPs in 2023 with an initial set of MVPs in which reporting is voluntary. Beginning in 2026, multispecialty groups must form subgroups to report MVPs. CMS plans to develop more MVPs from 2024 to 2027 and is considering that MVP reporting would become mandatory in 2028. Each MVP would include population health claims-based measures and require clinicians to report on the Promoting Interoperability performance category measures. In addition, MVP participants would select certain quality measures and improvement activities and then report data for such measures and activities.
Therapy Caps
Outpatient therapy providers reimbursed under the Medicare physician fee schedule have historically been subject to annual limits for therapy expenses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 repealed the annual limits on outpatient therapy but the law preserves the former therapy cap amounts as thresholds above which claims must include a modifier as a confirmation that services are medically necessary as justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record. For calendar year 2022, this modifier threshold amount is $2,150. The $2,150 threshold is applied to physical therapy and speech therapy services combined and separately applied to occupational therapy. This amount is indexed annually by the Medicare Economic Index. Claims for services over the modifier threshold amounts without the modifier are denied. Along with the modifier threshold, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 retained the targeted medical review process that was established in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. For calendar year 2018 through calendar year 2028, all therapy claims exceeding $3,000 are subject to a targeted manual medical review process. The $3,000 threshold is applied to physical therapy and speech therapy services combined and separately applied to occupational therapy. Beginning in 2028 and in each calendar year thereafter, the threshold amount for claims requiring targeted manual medical review will increase by the percentage increase in the Medicare Economic Index.
Modifiers to Identify Services of Physical Therapy Assistants or Occupational Therapy Assistants
In the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule for calendar year 2019, CMS established two new modifiers (CQ and CO) to identify services furnished in whole or in part by physical therapy assistants (“PTAs”) or occupational therapy assistants (“OTAs”). These modifiers were mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which requires that claims for outpatient therapy services furnished in whole or part by therapy assistants on or after January 1, 2020 include the appropriate modifier. In the final 2020 Medicare physician fee schedule rule, CMS clarified that when the physical therapist is involved for the entire duration of the service and the PTA provides skilled therapy alongside the physical therapist, the CQ modifier is not required. Also, when the same service (code) is furnished separately by the physical therapist and PTA, CMS will apply the de minimis standard to each 15-minute unit of codes, not on the total physical therapist and PTA time of the service, allowing the separate reporting, on two different claim lines, of the number of units to which the new modifiers apply and the number of units to which the modifiers do not apply. In the calendar year 2022 physician fee schedule final rule, CMS implemented the final part of the requirements in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 regarding PTA and OTA services. For dates of service on and after January 1, 2022, CMS will pay for physical therapy and occupational therapy services provided by PTAs and OTAs at 85% of the otherwise applicable Part B payment amount. CMS also modified the de minimis standard for calendar year 2022. Specifically, CMS will allow a timed service to be billed without the CQ or CO modifier when a PTA or OTA participates in providing care, but the physical therapist or occupational therapist meets the Medicare billing requirements without including the PTA’s or OTA’s minutes. This occurs when the physical therapist or occupational therapist provides more minutes than the 15-minute midpoint.
Other Requirements for Payment
Historically, outpatient rehabilitation services have been subject to scrutiny by the Medicare program for, among other things, medical necessity for services, appropriate documentation for services, supervision of therapy aides and students, and billing for single rather than group therapy when services are furnished to more than one patient. CMS has issued guidance to clarify that services performed by a student are not reimbursed even if provided under “line of sight” supervision of the therapist. Likewise, CMS has reiterated that Medicare does not pay for services provided by aides regardless of the level of supervision. CMS also has issued instructions that outpatient physical and occupational therapy services provided simultaneously to two or more individuals by a practitioner should be billed as group therapy services.
Medicaid Reimbursement of LTCH and IRF Services
The Medicaid program is designed to provide medical assistance to individuals unable to afford care. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965, funded jointly by each individual state and the federal government and administered by state agencies. Medicaid payments are made under a number of different systems, which include cost based reimbursement, prospective payment systems, or programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. In addition, Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy by the state agencies, and certain government funding limitations, all of which may increase or decrease the level of program payments to our hospitals. Revenue generated directly from the Medicaid program represented approximately 3% of our critical illness recovery hospital segment revenue and 2% of our rehabilitation hospital segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Healthcare Regulations
Federal Healthcare Program Changes in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has authorized a number of waivers or modifications of certain requirements under Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”) pursuant to section 1135 of the Social Security Act in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. For a description of such waivers and modifications, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Changes.”
Medicare COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate for Health Care Staff
On November 5, 2021, CMS issued an interim final rule amending the Medicare conditions of participation for twenty-one provider types, including hospitals, to require that Medicare and Medicaid-certified providers implement COVID-19 vaccination requirements for their staff. Hospitals that do not comply with these requirements may be subject to enforcement actions, including termination of their Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements. Two groups of states filed lawsuits challenging the interim final rule and obtained preliminary injunctions from two federal district courts that prevented CMS from enforcing the new vaccination requirements. However, on January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an order staying these injunctions. As a result of the Supreme Court’s order, CMS has resumed implementation and enforcement of the new vaccination requirements in all states.
Health care workers at facilities in the groups of states that filed lawsuits challenging the requirements have until February 14, 2022 to get their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination, and until March 15, 2022 to get their second dose, unless they have a qualifying religious or medical exemption. These states include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. CMS’s guidance states that a facility with more than 80% of its staff vaccinated, and a plan to achieve a 100% staff vaccination rate within 60 days of February 14, 2022, will be considered in compliance with the new rule. Similarly, a facility with more than 90% of its staff vaccinated on March 15, 2022, and a plan to achieve a 100% staff vaccination rate within 30 days, will be considered in compliance with the rule. By April 14, 2022, facilities in these states must achieve and maintain a 100% staff vaccination rate. 
The state of Texas filed a separate lawsuit challenging the vaccination mandate and also obtained a preliminary injunction preventing CMS from enforcing the interim final rule. However, Texas’ preliminary injunction was not specifically at issue in the Supreme Court’s January 13, 2022 order. Nonetheless, Texas moved to dismiss its lawsuit on January 18, 2022. CMS is requiring that facilities in Texas meet the same requirements discussed above by February 22, 2022, March 21, 2022, and April 20, 2022, respectively.
Facilities located in all other states were not covered by the preliminary injunctions issued by the federal district courts. Accordingly, CMS is still requiring that these facilities meet the same requirements discussed above by January 27, 2022, February 28, 2022, and March 30, 2022, respectively.
Medicare Quality Reporting
LTCHs and IRFs are subject to mandatory quality reporting requirements. LTCHs and IRFs that do not submit the required quality data will be subject to a 2% reduction in their annual payment update. The reduction can result in payment rates less than the prior year. However, the reduction will not carry over into the subsequent fiscal years.
Our LTCHs and IRFs are required to collect and report patient assessment data and clinical measures on each Medicare beneficiary who receives inpatient services in our facilities. We began reporting this data on October 1, 2012. CMS began making this data available to the public on the CMS website in December 2016. CMS has added cross-setting quality measures to compare quality and resource data across post-acute settings pursuant to the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”).
Medicare Hospital Wage Index Adjustment
As part of the methodology for determining prospective payments to LTCHs and IRFs, CMS adjusts the standard payment amounts for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level. This adjustment factor is the hospital wage index. CMS currently defines hospital geographic areas (labor market areas) based on the definitions of Core-Based Statistical Areas established by the Office of Management and Budget. 
Physician-Owned Hospital Limitations
CMS regulations include a number of hospital ownership and physician referral provisions, including certain obligations requiring physician-owned hospitals to disclose ownership or investment interests held by the referring physician or his or her immediate family members. In particular, physician-owned hospitals must furnish to patients, on request, a list of physicians or immediate family members who own or invest in the hospital. Moreover, a physician-owned hospital must require all physician owners or investors who are also active members of the hospital’s medical staff to disclose in writing their ownership or investment interests in the hospital to all patients they refer to the hospital. CMS can terminate the Medicare provider agreement of a physician-owned hospital if it fails to comply with these disclosure provisions or with the requirement that a hospital disclose in writing to all patients whether there is a physician on-site at the hospital, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
Under the transparency and program integrity provisions of the ACA, the exception to the federal self-referral law (the “Stark Law”) that permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an ownership or investment interest has been dramatically curtailed. Only hospitals with physician ownership and a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the percentage of physician ownership or investment interests held in the hospital after March 23, 2010. In addition, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, unless meeting specific exceptions related to the hospital’s location and patient population. In order to retain their exemption from the general ban on self-referrals, our physician-owned hospitals are required to adopt specific measures relating to conflicts of interest, bona fide investments and patient safety. As of December 31, 2021, we operated four hospitals that are owned in-part by physicians.
Medicare Recovery Audit Contractors
CMS contracts with third-party organizations, known as Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) to identify Medicare underpayments and overpayments, and to authorize RACs to recoup any overpayments. RACs are paid on a contingency fee basis. The contingency fee is a percentage of improper overpayment recoveries or underpayments identified by the RAC. The RAC must return the contingency fee if an improper payment determination is reversed on appeal. RACs conduct audit activities nationwide in four regions of the country that cover all 50 states on a combined basis. RAC audits of our Medicare reimbursement may lead to assertions that we have been overpaid, require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials through appeals, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict the impact of future RAC reviews on our results of operations or cash flows.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
Various federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain payment under Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs. Penalties for violation of these laws include civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. In recent years, federal and state government agencies have increased the level of enforcement resources and activities targeted at the healthcare industry. In addition, the federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes allow individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government, in what are known as qui tam or “whistleblower” actions, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute. The use of these private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically in recent years, in part because the individual filing the initial complaint is entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment. Revisions to the False Claims Act enacted in 2009 expanded significantly the scope of liability, provided for new investigative tools, and made it easier for whistleblowers to bring and maintain False Claims Act suits on behalf of the government. See “—Legal Proceedings.”
From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) issue a variety of pronouncements, including fraud alerts, the OIG’s Annual Work Plan, and other reports, identifying practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny. These pronouncements can identify issues relating to LTCHs, IRFs, or outpatient rehabilitation services or providers. For example, the OIG recently announced that it will (1) determine whether Medicare appropriately paid hospitals’ inpatient claims subject to the post-acute care transfer policy, (2) determine whether Medicare paid new hospitals for claimed capital costs in accordance with Federal regulations, (3) determine whether Medicare appropriately paid inpatient hospital claims for mechanical ventilation services, and (4) examine whether Medicaid paid IRFs correctly when patients are discharged prematurely to receive home health services. We monitor government publications applicable to us to supplement and enhance our compliance efforts.
We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, including healthcare fraud and abuse laws. If we identify any practices as being potentially contrary to applicable law, we will take appropriate action to address the matter, including, where appropriate, disclosure to the proper authorities, which may result in a voluntary refund of monies to Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental healthcare programs.
Remuneration and Fraud Measures
The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits some business practices and relationships under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. These practices include the payment, receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration in connection with, to induce, or to arrange for, the referral of patients covered by a federal or state healthcare program. Violations of the anti-kickback law may be punished by: a criminal fine of up to $100,000 or up to ten years imprisonment for each violation, or both; civil monetary penalties of $20,000, $30,000 or $100,000 per violation, depending on the type of violation; damages of up to three times the total amount of remuneration; and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs.
The Stark Law prohibits referrals for designated health services by physicians under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to other healthcare providers in which the physicians have an ownership or compensation arrangement unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include returning program reimbursements, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided, assessments equal to three times the dollar value of each such service provided, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs. The statute also provides a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. In addition, many states have adopted or may adopt similar anti-kickback or anti-self-referral statutes. Some of these statutes prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients, regardless of the source of the payment for the care. While we do not believe our arrangements are in violation of these prohibitions, we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing the provisions of these prohibitions will not assert that one or more of our arrangements are in violation of the provisions of such laws and regulations.
Provider-Based Status
The designation “provider-based” refers to circumstances in which a subordinate facility (such as a separately certified Medicare provider, a department of a provider, or a satellite facility) is treated as part of a provider for Medicare payment purposes. In these cases, the services of the subordinate facility are included on the “main” provider’s cost report and overhead costs of the main provider can be allocated to the subordinate facility, to the extent that they are shared. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 19 critical illness recovery hospitals and seven rehabilitation hospitals that were treated as provider-based satellites of certain of our other facilities. In addition, 263 of the outpatient rehabilitation clinics we operated were provider-based and operated as departments of the rehabilitation hospitals we operated. We also provide rehabilitation management and staffing services to hospital rehabilitation departments that may be treated as provider-based. These facilities are required to satisfy certain operational standards in order to retain their provider-based status.
Health Information Practices
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) mandates the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare industry, while maintaining the privacy and security of health information. Among the standards that the Department of Health and Human Services has adopted or will adopt pursuant to HIPAA are standards for electronic transactions and code sets, unique identifiers for providers (referred to as National Provider Identifier), employers, health plans and individuals, security and electronic signatures, privacy, and enforcement. If we fail to comply with the HIPAA requirements, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions. The privacy, security and enforcement provisions of HIPAA were enhanced by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which was included in the ARRA. Among other things, HITECH establishes security breach notification requirements, allows enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increases penalties for HIPAA violations.
The Department of Health and Human Services has adopted standards in three areas in which we are required to comply that affect our operations.
Standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information govern our use and disclosure of protected health information and require us to impose those rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom such information is disclosed.
Standards relating to electronic transactions and code sets require the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions, including healthcare claims information, plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment and disenrollment, payment and remittance advice, plan premium payments, and coordination of benefits.
Standards for the security of electronic health information require us to implement various administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of electronic protected health information.
We maintain a Privacy and Security Committee that is charged with evaluating and monitoring our compliance with HIPAA. The Privacy and Security Committee monitors regulations promulgated under HIPAA as they have been adopted to date and as additional standards and modifications are adopted. Although health information standards have had a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health data and communicate with payors, the cost of our compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We cannot estimate the cost of compliance with standards that have not been issued or finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services.
In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur. Although our policies and procedures are aimed at complying with privacy and security requirements and minimizing the risks of any breach of privacy or security, there can be no assurance that a breach of privacy or security will not occur. If there is a breach, we may be subject to various penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.
IMPACT Act
In October 2014, President Obama signed the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act (“IMPACT Act” into law. The IMPACT Act made a number of changes and additions to Medicare quality reporting for LTCHs, IRFs, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), and home health agencies (“HHAs”). In addition, the IMPACT Act requires HHS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”) to develop a technical prototype for a unified post-acute care (“PAC”) prospective payment system (“PPS”) that could replace the four existing payment systems for LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs.
The IMPACT Act directed HHS to begin requiring providers to report certain standardized patient assessment data to CMS. HHS had to adopt this reporting requirement by October 1, 2018, for LTCHs, IRFs, and SNFs, and by January 1, 2019, for HHAs. The IMPACT Act also required CMS to adopt and implement new cross-setting quality measures addressing, at a minimum, the following quality domains: (1) functional status, cognitive function, and changes in function and cognitive function; (2) skin integrity and changes in skin integrity; (3) medication reconciliation; (4) incidence of major falls; and (5) providing for the transfer of health information and treatment preferences of the patient upon transition from a hospital or critical access hospital to another setting, including a PAC provider or the individual’s home, or upon transition from a PAC provider to another setting including a different PAC provider, hospital, critical access hospital, or the individual’s home. Next, the IMPACT Act required that by October 1, 2016, for SNFs, IRFs and LTCHs, and by January 1, 2017, for HHAs, CMS specify resource use and other measures for inclusion in the applicable reporting provisions. At a minimum, the resource use measures must include the following resource use domains: (1) resource use measures, including total estimated Medicare spending per beneficiary; (2) discharge to community; and (3) measures to reflect all-condition risk-adjusted hospitalization rates of potentially preventable readmission rates. CMS began implementing the IMPACT Act’s data reporting requirements in the FY 2016 rulemakings for LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs. 
In addition to the new reporting requirements, the IMPACT Act outlined a process for the potential development of a unified PAC PPS. The IMPACT Act does not require CMS to adopt a unified PAC PPS, nor does it provide CMS with specific authority to implement a new payment system. However, the IMPACT Act does require HHS and MedPAC to submit a series of reports to Congress with recommendations and a technical prototype for a PAC PPS. These recommendations and prototypes could become the basis of future legislation that would create a unified PAC PPS to replace some or all of the existing Medicare payment systems for LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs. MedPAC submitted the first report to Congress in June 2016. The report included recommended features for a unified PAC payment system. The Secretary of HHS will submit the next report to Congress with recommendations and a technical prototype. The Secretary’s report is due no later than two years after CMS has collected two years of data on the quality measures required by the IMPACT Act. After the Secretary’s report, MedPAC is to submit a second report to Congress with recommendations and a technical prototype for a new PAC payment system. The Secretary is expected to issue his report to Congress sometime in 2022. However, a bipartisan bill introduced in the House of Representatives in April 2021 would require the Secretary to first collect eight quarters of IMPACT Act data, including standardized patient assessment data, quality measure data, resource use and claims data, before submitting his report to Congress. The legislation would require that the eight quarters of data could not include any month in which the COVID-19 public health emergency, or a similar nationwide public health emergency, is ongoing. The recommendations and technical prototype in the Secretary’s report would also need to account for the role and value of each PAC provider-type during public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 public health emergency by, for example, looking at the proportion and acuity levels of COVID-19 patients treated in each PAC setting. If enacted, the Secretary’s report would not be submitted before the later of January 1, 2024 or two years after the Secretary collects eight quarters of data.
Price Transparency
Starting January 1, 2021, new regulations went into effect requiring hospitals to provide clear and accessible pricing information online regarding the items and services they provide. First, a new regulation requires hospitals to provide a machine readable file containing the following standard charges for all items and services provided by the hospital: gross charges, discounted cash prices, payer-specific negotiated charges, and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges. Second, hospitals must provide a consumer-friendly display of standard charges for at least 300 “shoppable services” that consumers can schedule in advance. If a hospital does not offer 300 “shoppable services,” then the hospital must provide the consumer-friendly display of standard charges for all of the “shoppable services” that it does provide. For each “shoppable service,” hospitals must provide: discounted cash prices, payer-specific negotiated charges, and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges. For hospitals that do not comply with these requirements, CMS may issue a warning notice, request a corrective action plan, and impose a civil monetary penalty that is publicized on the CMS website. These regulations were promulgated by the Trump administration and, on July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing HHS to support the new price transparency regulations. On November 16, 2021, CMS issued a final rule that increased the maximum fines for hospitals that do not comply with the price transparency regulations. In 2021, non-compliant hospitals are subject to a fine of $300 per day. Beginning on January 1, 2022, non-compliant hospitals with 30 or fewer beds are still subject to a fine of $300 per day, not to exceed $2,007,500 per hospital per year. However, beginning January 1, 2022, non-complaint hospitals with 31 or more beds are subject to a fine in an amount that is equal to the number of hospital beds times 10, not to exceed $5,500 per day and $2,007,500 per year for each hospital. The maximum fine amounts are subject to increase annually using a multiplier determined by the Office of Management and Budget. CMS also revised its price transparency regulations to require that starting January 1, 2022, hospitals must make their standard charge information easily accessible without barriers. This includes providing the charge information in manner so that it can be accessed by automated searches and direct file downloads. 
Surprise Billing
On July 13, 2021, HHS, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Office of Personnel Management published an interim final rule with comment period to implement certain provisions of the No Surprises Act, which was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The interim final rule includes new regulations aimed at limiting surprise medical bills issued by health care providers to consumers. The HHS regulations adopted by this interim final rule are effective January 1, 2022 and apply to hospital emergency departments, freestanding emergency departments, health care providers and facilities, and providers of air ambulance services. The new regulations do not apply to patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health Services, Veterans Affairs health care, or TRICARE because these programs already prohibit balance billing. 
Starting January 1, 2022, the interim final rule’s new regulations will apply to patients with health insurance coverage from a group health plan (including a self-insured group health plan) or from an individual market health insurance issuer. First, if a plan provides coverage for emergency services, the interim final rule requires that emergency services must be covered: (1) without prior authorization; (2) regardless of whether the provider is an in-network provider or an in-network emergency facility; and (3) regardless of any other term or condition of the plan or coverage other than the exclusion or coordination of benefits, or a permitted affiliation or waiting period. Second, the interim final rule includes new limits on patient cost-sharing obligations for out-of-network services. Specifically, patient cost-sharing amounts for emergency services provided by out-of-network emergency facilities and out-of-network providers, and certain non-emergency services furnished by out-of-network providers at certain in-network facilities, must be calculated based on one of the following amounts: (1) an amount determined by an applicable All-Payer Model Agreement under section 1115A of the Social Security Act; (2) a specified state law if there is no such All-Payer Model Agreement; or (3) if neither of the above apply, the lesser amount of either the billed charge or the qualifying payment amount, which is generally the plan or issuer’s median contracted rate. Third, the interim final rule prohibits non-participating providers, health care facilities, and providers of air ambulance services from balance billing participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees in certain situations. Fourth, the interim final rule establishes that the total amount to be paid to an out-of-network provider or facility, including any cost-sharing, is based on: (1) an amount determined by an applicable All-Payer Model Agreement under section 1115A of the Social Security Act; (2) a specified state law if there is no such All-Payer Model Agreement; or (3) an amount agreed upon by the plan or issuer and the provider or facility if there is no such Agreement or state law. If none of these three circumstances apply, then the amount is determined by an independent dispute resolution (“IDR”) entity. Fifth, a new regulation requires providers and facilities to make publicly available and provide patients with a one-page notice regarding the requirements and prohibitions applicable to the provider or facility regarding balance billing, any applicable state balance billing prohibitions or limitations, and information on how to contact appropriate state and federal agencies if the patient believes the provider or facility has violated the requirements described in the notice. Finally, the interim final rule establishes a process for HHS to receive and resolve complaints regarding information that any health care provider, provider of air ambulance services, or health care facility may be failing to meet the requirements set forth in the interim final rule. Because these new regulations were adopted through an interim final rule with comment period, they may be modified after CMS reviews public comments. The comment period closed on September 7, 2021.
In a separate interim final rule published on October 7, 2021, HHS, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Office of Personnel Management adopted regulations that will govern the IDR process that will be available to providers and insurers that are unable to agree on the payment rate for out-of-network providers. These new regulations are effective starting on January 1, 2022. The new IDR process presumes that the qualifying payment amount (“QPA”) is the appropriate payment rate for an out-of-network service. Accordingly, the new IDR regulations require arbitrators to choose the offer that is closest to the QPA, unless the arbitrator determines that a party has credible information demonstrating that the QPA is “materially different” from the appropriate out-of-network rate for the item or service. The factors the arbitrator may consider to determine if the QPA is not the appropriate rate include: (1) the provider’s training, experience, and quality and outcome measurements; (2) the provider’s market share in the region; (3) patient acuity or the complexity of furnishing the item or service to the patient; (4) the provider’s teaching status, case mix, and scope of services offered; and (5) whether the provider or the plan engaged in good faith efforts to enter into a network agreement. Separate regulations in this interim final rule address a dispute resolution process for uninsured patients who receive a good faith estimate of expected charges from a provider, but are then billed an amount that substantially exceeds the estimated charges. When the provider’s billed charges are more than $400 greater than the good faith estimate, an uninsured patient may initiate a patient-provider dispute resolution process by submitting a notification to HHS within 120 days of receiving the provider’s bill. The dispute resolution entity will then examine whether the provider has credible information demonstrating that the excess charges are attributable to unforeseen circumstances that the provider could not have reasonably anticipated when the provider made the good faith estimate. The regulations for both the provider-insurer IDR process and the provider-patient dispute resolution process could be revised in response to comments submitted to the agencies issuing this interim final rule. The comment period closed on December 6, 2021. 
Compliance Program
Our Compliance Program
We maintain a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) that provides guidelines for principles and regulatory rules that are applicable to our patient care and business activities. The Code of Conduct is reviewed and amended as necessary and is the basis for our company-wide compliance program. These guidelines are implemented by our compliance officer, our compliance and audit committee, and are communicated to our employees through education and training. We also have established a reporting system, auditing and monitoring programs, and a disciplinary system as a means for enforcing the Code of Conduct’s policies.
Compliance and Audit Committee
Our compliance and audit committee is made up of members of our senior management and in-house counsel. The compliance and audit committee meets, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis and reviews the activities, reports, and operation of our compliance program. In addition, our Privacy and Security Committee provides reports to the compliance and audit committee. Our vice president of compliance and audit services meets with the compliance and audit committee, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis to provide an overview of the activities and operation of our compliance program.
Operating Our Compliance Program
We focus on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends upon individual employee actions as well as company operations. As a result, we have adopted an operations team approach to compliance. Our corporate executives, with the assistance of corporate experts, designed the programs of the compliance and audit committee. We utilize facility leaders for employee-level implementation of our Code of Conduct. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business.
Compliance Issue Reporting
In order to facilitate our employees’ ability to report known, suspected, or potential violations of our Code of Conduct, we have developed a system of reporting. This reporting, anonymous or attributable, may be accomplished through our toll-free compliance hotline, compliance e-mail address, or our compliance post office box. Our compliance officer and the compliance and audit committee are responsible for reviewing and investigating each compliance incident in accordance with the compliance and audit services department’s investigation policy.
Compliance Monitoring and Auditing / Comprehensive Training and Education
Monitoring reports and the results of compliance for each of our business segments are reported to the compliance and audit committee, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We train and educate our employees regarding the Code of Conduct, as well as the legal and regulatory requirements relevant to each employee’s work environment. New and current employees are required to acknowledge and certify that the employee has read, understood, and has agreed to abide by the Code of Conduct. Additionally, all employees are required to re-certify compliance with the Code of Conduct on an annual basis.
Policies and Procedures Reflecting Compliance Focus Areas
We review our policies and procedures for our compliance program from time to time in order to improve operations and to promote compliance with requirements of standards, laws, and regulations and to reflect the ongoing compliance focus areas which have been identified by the compliance and audit committee.
Internal Audit
We have a compliance and audit department, which has an internal audit function. Our vice president of compliance and audit services manages the combined compliance and audit department and meets with the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis to discuss audit results and provide an overview of the activities and operation of our compliance program.
