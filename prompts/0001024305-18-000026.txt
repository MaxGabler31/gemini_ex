Item 1. Business. 
Overview
Coty Inc. is one of the world’s largest beauty companies with a rich entrepreneurial heritage and an iconic portfolio of brands. Founded in 1904, Coty has grown into a multi-segment beauty company with market leading positions in both North America and Europe through new product offerings, diversified sales channels, acquisitions and a global growth strategy. Today, we are the global leader in fragrance, a strong number two in professional salon hair color & styling, and number three in color cosmetics. 
Over the past three years, transformational acquisitions and strategic transactions have strengthened and diversified our presence across the countries, product categories and channels in which we compete, including our acquisition of The Proctor & Gamble Company’s beauty business (the “P&G Beauty Business”), the acquisition of ghd, a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances, the acquisition of the Brazilian personal care and beauty business of Hypermarcas S.A. (the “Hypermarcas Brands”), and our joint venture with Younique LLC (“Younique”), a leading online peer-to-peer social selling platform in beauty. In addition, we acquired the exclusive long-term global license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare. 
We are focused on rejuvenating our core business and amplifying our growth potential, by supporting and strengthening our brands and developing a stronger innovation pipeline, including by accelerating our time to market with on-trend collections and products, and advancing our end-to-end digital transformation and e-commerce efforts. We are also prioritizing our growth opportunities to expand in the faster-growing emerging markets, as we continue our restructuring efforts to optimize our business and reset fixed costs. 
Segments
We are organized into three divisions, which are also our operating and reportable segments: Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty. Our organizational structure is product category focused, putting the consumer first, by specifically targeting how and where they shop and what and why they purchase. Each division has end-to-end responsibility to optimize the consumers’ beauty experiences in their relevant categories and channels and to translate this into profitable growth.
Consumer Beauty is primarily focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products, body care and mass fragrances. 
Luxury is primarily focused on prestige fragrances, premium skincare and premium cosmetics. 
Professional Beauty is primarily focused on hair and nail care products for salon professionals. 
For segment and geographic area financial information and information about our long-lived assets, see Note 4, “Segment Reporting” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and for information about recent acquisitions or dispositions of any material amount of assets, see Note 3, “Business Combinations” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Marketing
We have a diverse portfolio of over 75 brands, some owned and some licensed, and we employ different models to create a distinct image and personality suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus and consumer. For our licensed brands, we work with licensors to promote brand image. Each of our brands is promoted with logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and the uniqueness of each brand. We manage our creative marketing work through a combination of our in-house teams and external agencies that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. Our marketing teams work closely with our digital marketing agency, increasingly using digital social listening and trend spotting capabilities to expand digital marketing of our brands to different channels as the behaviors of beauty consumers continue to transform. 
We promote our brands through various channels to reach and engage beauty consumers, through traditional media, through in-store and in-salon displays, increasingly on digital and social media, and through collaborations, product placements and events. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for products and brands in both traditional media and digital and social media to drive influencer amplification and to build brand equity. We also leverage our relationships with celebrities and on-line influencers to endorse certain of our products.
We have dedicated marketing and sales forces in most of our significant markets. These teams leverage local insights to strategically promote our brands and product offerings and tailor our creative marketing to fit local tastes and resonate with consumers most effectively. 
We are focused on revamping our in-store execution and deploying new brand visuals for certain of our brands. Our marketing efforts benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, often in connection with in-store marketing activities designed to engage consumers so that they try, or purchase, our products, including sampling and “gift-with-purchase” programs designed to stimulate product trials. We have been working with retailers to develop branding and 
2

marketing execution strategies and to enhance our in-store execution by implementing “perfect store” methodologies to maximize the consumer experience. 
Distribution Channels and Retail Sales
We market, sell and distribute our products in over 150 countries and territories, with dedicated local sales forces in most of our significant markets. We have a balanced multi-channel distribution strategy which complements our product category focused divisions. The Consumer Beauty division primarily sells products through hypermarkets, supermarkets, drug stores and pharmacies, mid-tier department stores, and traditional food and drug retailers. The Luxury division primarily sells products through prestige retailers, including perfumeries, department stores and duty-free shops, with travel retail sales channels accounting for 15% of the division’s net revenues. The Professional Beauty division primarily sells products to nail and hair salons, nail and hair professionals and professionals stores. We also sell our products through third-party distributors. In fiscal 2018, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of our global net revenues; however, certain retailers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues within certain geographic markets and segments. In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart, our top retailer, accounted for 6% of our net revenues. We are focused on expanding our e-commerce presence. All of our divisions sell products through direct-to-consumer websites, third party-operated websites and through our own branded websites. In addition, we selectively evaluate opportunities to expand into other channels, such as freestanding retail stores for certain brands and social selling. 
Innovation
Innovation is a pillar of our business. We innovate through brand-building and new product lines, as well as through new technology. Our research and development teams work with our marketing and operations teams, as well as our internal digital agency to identify recent trends and consumer needs and to bring products quickly to market. 
We are continuously innovating to increase our sales by elevating our digital presence, including e-commerce and digital, social media and influencer marketing designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement. We have also focused our efforts on meeting evolving consumer shopping preferences and behaviors, both on-line and in-store. We have introduced new ways to customize the consumer experience, including using artificial intelligence-powered tools to provide personalized advice on selecting and using products, and augmented reality tools that invite customers to virtually try products with curated looks, tutorials and product recommendations. 
In addition, we continuously seek to improve our products through research and development. Our basic and applied research groups, which conduct longer-term and “blue sky” research, seek to develop proprietary new technologies for first-to-market products and for improving existing products. This research and development is done both internally and through affiliations with various universities, technical centers, supply partners, industry associations and technical associations. As of June 30, 2018, we owned approximately 2,000 utility patents and patent applications globally and approximately 1,800 design patents.
Our principal research and development centers are located in the U.S. and Europe. See “Item 2. Properties.”
We do not perform, nor do we commission any third parties on our behalf to perform, testing of our products or ingredients on animals except where required by law. 
Supply Chain
We manufacture and package a majority of our products, primarily in the United States, Europe and Brazil. Our manufacturing facilities provide multi-segment manufacturing. We recognize the importance of our employees at our manufacturing facilities and have in place programs designed to ensure operating safety. In addition, we implement programs designed to ensure that our manufacturing and distribution facilities comply with applicable environmental rules and regulations. To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis. 
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are primarily essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. The essential oils in our fragrance products are generally sourced from fragrance houses. As a result, we realize material cost savings and benefits from the technology, innovation and resources provided by these fragrance houses.
We purchase the raw materials for all our products from various third parties. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. We collaborate with our suppliers to meet our stringent design and creative criteria. We believe that we currently have adequate sources of supply for all our products. 
Following the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, we have been engaged in a transformation of our supply chain aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization, and we continue to focus on restructuring our supply chain footprint and processes in order to increase efficiency, improve utilization and reduce our order lead times. We have 
3

experienced disruptions in our supply chain from time to time, including in connection with these restructuring efforts, and we work to anticipate and respond to actual and potential disruptions. 
Competition
There is significant competition within each market where our products are sold. We compete against manufacturers and marketers of beauty products, hair care, salon professional and personal care products. In addition to the established multinational brands against which we compete, small targeted niche brands continue to enter the beauty market. Competition is also increasing from private label products sold by retailers.
We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of perceived value, including pricing and innovation, product efficacy, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce initiatives, direct sales and other activities (including influencers). It is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and effectiveness of our competitors’ actions in these areas or the timing and impact of new entrants into the marketplace. For additional risks associated with our competitive position, see “Risk Factors—The beauty industry is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation could suffer”. 
Intellectual Property
We generally own or license the trademark rights in key sales countries in Trademark International Class 3 (covering cosmetics and perfumery) for use in connection with our brands. When we license trademark rights we generally enter into long-term licenses, and we are generally the exclusive trademark licensee for all Class 3 trademarks as used in connection with our products. We or our licensors, as the case may be, actively protect the trademarks used in our principal products in the U.S. and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be essential to our business.
A number of our products also incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in their respective formulations and/or packaging, and in some cases our product packaging is subject to copyright, trade dress or design protection. While we consider our patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is material to the conduct of our business. 
Products representing 39% of our fiscal 2018 net revenues are manufactured and marketed under exclusive license agreements granted to us for use on a worldwide and/or regional basis. As of June 30, 2018, we maintained 31 brand licenses. 
Our licenses impose obligations and restrictions on us that we believe are common to many licensing relationships in the beauty industry, such as paying annual royalties on net sales of the licensed products and maintaining the quality of the licensed products and the image of the applicable trademarks. We are currently in material compliance with the terms of our brand license agreements.
Most brand licenses have renewal options for one or more terms, which can range from three to ten years. Certain brand licenses provide for automatic extensions, so long as minimum annual royalty payments are made, while renewal of others is contingent upon attaining of specified sales levels or upon agreement of the licensor. One of our brand licenses is up for renewal during fiscal 2019, and, while many of our licenses are long term, licenses relating to certain of our global brands are up for renewal in the next few years. For additional risks associated with our licensing arrangements, see “Risk Factors—Our brand licenses may be terminated if specified conditions are not met, and we may not be able to renew expiring licenses on favorable terms or at all” and “Risk Factors—Our failure to protect our reputation, or the failure of our partners or brand licensors to protect their reputations, could have a material adverse effect on our brand images”.
Employees
As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately 20,000 full-time employees in over 46 countries. In addition, we employ a large number of seasonal contractors during our peak manufacturing and promotional season. We expect our overall headcount to decrease as we continue our efforts to restructure and rationalize our business.
Our employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in certain countries in Europe are subject to works council arrangements. We have not experienced a material strike or work stoppage in the U.S. or any other country where we have a significant number of employees.
We recognize the importance of our employees to our business and believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.

Government Regulation
We and our products are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies as well as by various state and local regulatory authorities and by the applicable regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, advertising and marketing and sales and distribution of our products. Because we have commercial operations overseas, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) as well as other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. 
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, environmental and social responsibility laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs and risks of non-compliance for us. For example, certain states in the U.S., such as California, and the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation relating to chemical disclosure and other requirements related to the content of our products. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business or products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Seasonality
Our sales generally increase during our second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. We also experience an increase in sales during our fourth fiscal quarter in our Professional Beauty segment as a result of stronger activity prior to the summer holiday season. Working capital requirements, sales, and cash flows generally experience variability during the three to six months preceding the holiday period due in part to product innovations and new product launches and the size and timing of certain orders from our customers. We generally experience peak inventory levels from July to October and peak receivable balances from September to December. During the months of November, December and January of each year, cash is normally generated as customer payments for holiday season orders are received. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to seasonal variability.”
