Item 1.    Business
Company
We are a design, innovation and distribution company specializing in consumer fashion accessories. Our products include traditional watches, smartwatches, jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts and sunglasses. We design, develop, market and distribute products under our owned brands FOSSIL, SKAGEN, MICHELE, RELIC and ZODIAC and licensed brands ARMANI EXCHANGE, DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, KATE SPADE NEW YORK, MICHAEL KORS, PUMA, and TORY BURCH. Based on our range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.
Operating Strategy
Our goal is to drive shareholder value by increasing earnings and making a positive impact on our people, planet and communities. We operate in a challenging business environment, particularly given the global pandemic. However, we see opportunities for sustainable growth and value creation by focusing on the following strategic priorities:
Intensify Brand Heat
Design, creativity and innovation are the lifeblood of our Company. We drive excitement and demand for our brands with great product, storytelling and customized communications to build engaged communities of passionate consumers. As the consumer moves toward more normal and stronger purchasing patterns, they will be looking for differentiated and exciting merchandise online and in store. We plan to invest more in the creativity and marketing of our flagship FOSSIL brand and leverage our increasing digital capabilities to drive brand awareness and sales.
Drive to digital 
We continue to focus on becoming a digital-first organization, which for us entails four pillars: (i) extending our direct-to-consumer foundation; (ii) reimagining how we participate in marketplaces; (iii) building a marketing and analytics powerhouse; and (iv) transforming to a digital-first company through new talent, tools and technologies. We have and will continue to make significant investments to strengthen and further mature our digital capabilities related to these four objectives.
Importantly, in fiscal year 2021, our successful initiatives included extending our Salesforce Commerce Cloud capabilities around the world, investing in a new Digital Asset Management platform to streamline the production and dissemination of digital-first content around the world, and developing new digital initiatives for our employees to drive engagement and fluency. We also became more agile, creating cross-functional teams to work together on dedicated digital projects, accelerating speed and collaboration, and instilling a “fail fast” mindset.
We will continue building on our digital-first strategies throughout fiscal year 2022, including key investments in technology platforms, digital talent and new capabilities to accelerate our direct-to-consumer experience.
Optimize Operations
We have made significant changes in our infrastructure, our commercial activities and in how we manage SKUs, inventory and cash. We will continue to rationalize our retail store base, critically manage our capital investments, and further optimize our tactics and strategies in inventory management and our end-to-end supply chain. Overall, we want to reinvent the entire business and be as cost-effective as possible.
Expand Opportunity in Mainland China and India
We are continuing to execute against a strategy centered around localized marketing and segmented assortments in mainland China and India. Although the impact of COVID-19 is likely to disrupt our growth trajectory in the short to intermediate term, we continue to view mainland China and India as compelling long-term opportunities.
Make Time for Good
While commercial success is essential for our future, it is critical that we continue to do the right thing for our people, planet and communities. We call our platform for Sustainability or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) “Make Time for Good”. We believe a sense of purpose is also critically important to our employees, shareholders, and customers. Our people goals include continuing to strengthen our diversity, equity and inclusion programs and objectives. Our planet goals include significantly reducing our carbon footprint and emphasizing recycling and use of resources. Our community goals include empowering women and girls and to continue to increase our impact on underserved young lives.
Segments
We report segment information based on the “management approach”. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.
We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of (i) Americas, (ii) Europe and (iii) Asia. Each reportable operating segment includes sales to wholesale and distributor customers, and sales through Company-owned retail stores and e-commerce activities based on the location of the selling entity. The Americas segment primarily includes sales to customers based in Canada, Latin America and the United States. The Europe segment primarily includes sales to customers based in European countries, the Middle East and Africa. The Asia segment primarily includes sales to customers based in Australia, Greater China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Each reportable operating segment provides similar products and services.

 (1) Subject to early termination in certain circumstances

We also license certain internationally known brand names, such as Skechers and BMW, for limited distribution in select markets.
Fashion Accessories
In addition to our core watch business, we also design and create handbags, small leather goods, and belts across certain of our owned brands and jewelry under our owned brands and certain licensed brands. In the U.S. and certain international markets, we generally market our fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as our watches using similar marketing approaches. Our fashion accessories are typically sold in locations adjacent to watch departments, which may lead to purchases by persons who are familiar with our watch brands. Sales of our accessory lines accounted for 16.9%, 16.7% and 16.2% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table sets forth information about our fashion accessories:

Brand | Accessory Category 
DIESEL | Jewelry 
EMPORIO ARMANI | Jewelry 
FOSSIL | Handbags, small leather goods, belts, eyewear, jewelry
MICHAEL KORS | Jewelry 
SKAGEN | Jewelry 

Licensed Eyewear
We have a license agreement with the Safilo Group for both FOSSIL branded sunglasses and optical frames worldwide, which expires on December 31, 2023. The license agreement provides for royalties to be paid to us based on a percentage of net sales and includes certain guaranteed minimum royalties. Sales of licensed eyewear accounted for approximately 0.4%, 0.4% and 0.5% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Stores
Our products are sold across approximately 145 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned sales subsidiaries and through a network of 70 independent distributors. Our products are offered on airlines and cruise ships and in international Company-owned retail stores. Our network of Company-owned stores included 171 retail stores and 199 outlet stores as of 
January 1, 2022. In certain international markets, our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks. 
Marketing
Our marketing approach meets the consumer wherever they are, both online and offline. We create the best possible brand experience through a blend of art and science – which means that we prioritize both data-driven decision-making and creativity in our marketing strategies and tactics. 
In fiscal year 2021, we created an in-house marketing center of excellence, serving both our owned and licensed brands, to better connect with consumers and drive sustained engagement and awareness. This capability works across channels, including digital marketing, social media, email marketing, Customer Relationship Management, partner marketing and digital media. We have built proprietary algorithms to support the profitable flow-through of marketing investment, optimized across channels, brands and countries. We deliver increasingly better personalization through ongoing test-and-learn as well as through the consumer insight and predictive analytics capabilities we have built over the past few years.
Because of our emerging capability and visibility to profitable growth within marketing, we are strategically increasing our marketing investment. For fiscal year 2021, total marketing investments were $168.4 million, representing 9.0% of total net sales. This is compared to $126.3 million in fiscal year 2020, which represented 7.8% of total net sales, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%.
Distribution
We distribute our products globally through regional warehouses with our warehouse in Dallas, Texas serving the Americas, our warehouse in Eggstätt, Germany serving Europe and our warehouse in Hong Kong serving Asia. For those countries in which our products are distributed, but where we don’t have a physical presence, we use third-party distributors. From our regional warehouses, our products are shipped to subsidiary warehouses, distributors, wholesale accounts or directly to customers in selected markets. Our extensive distribution network allows us to reach a diverse global customer base. We sell our products through a range of channels including e-commerce, Company-owned retail stores, department and specialty retail stores, airlines, mass markets and concessions.
Digital
Our holistic e-commerce efforts include three forms of digital channels. First, our owned global e-commerce websites for our branded portfolio deliver mobile-friendly experiences, engaging brand content, and seamless omni-channel integration with retail stores, including the ability to buy certain products online and pick up in store, curbside pickup and ship from store. Second, we distribute our products through leading third-party e-commerce retailers and marketplaces. Third, we distribute through some of our wholesalers’ e-commerce websites and a wide network of additional online retailers.
Our e-commerce capabilities and digital penetration continue to grow as a part of our total business. In fiscal year 2021, our digital sales comprised 41.3% of consolidated net sales compared to 38.8% in fiscal year 2020 and 20.1% in fiscal year 2019. We will continue to invest in growing our e-commerce capabilities in fiscal year 2022, with a focus on improving and streamlining the consumer experience.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
The vast majority of our products are sourced internationally. Most watch product sourcing is coordinated through our Hong Kong subsidiary, Fossil (East) Limited (“Fossil East”). We have some limited watch assembly operations through owned facilities in India and Switzerland. Although we do not have long-term contracts with our unrelated watch and accessory manufacturers, we maintain long-term relationships with several manufacturers. These relationships developed due to the significant length of time we have conducted business with the same manufacturers. We believe that we are able to exert some operational control with regard to our principal watch assemblers because of our long-standing relationships. In addition, we believe that the relative size of our business with watch manufacturers gives us priority within their production schedules. Furthermore, the manufacturers understand our quality standards, which allow us to produce quality products supporting overall operating margins. We have also added third-party facilities and relationships for manufacturing our wearable technology products. 
Our quality control program attempts to ensure that our products meet the standards established by our product development and quality staff. Development samples of products are inspected by us prior to placing orders with factories to ensure compliance with our designs. We also typically inspect or audit inspections of "top of production" samples of each product for compliance before or at the start of commencing production. The operations of the Hong Kong and Chinese 
factories that produce our products are monitored on a periodic basis by Fossil East, and the operations of our Swiss factories are monitored on a periodic basis by Montres Antima SA, one of our foreign operating subsidiaries.
Intellectual Property
We use our FOSSIL, MICHELE, RELIC, SKAGEN and ZODIAC trademarks, as well as other trademarks, on watches, our FOSSIL and SKAGEN trademarks on smartwatches and jewelry, and our FOSSIL trademark on leather goods and other fashion accessories in the U.S. and in a significant number of foreign countries. We also use FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL, and WSI as trademarks on retail stores and FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL, WSI, MISFIT, ZODIAC and MICHELE as trademarks on online e-commerce sites. We have taken steps to establish or provide additional protection for our trademarks by registering or applying to register our trademarks for relevant classes of products in each country where our products are sold in addition to certain foreign countries where it is our intent to market our products in the future. We also have rights in certain copyrights and designs both in the United States and in other countries where are products are principally sold.
We continue to explore innovations in the design and assembly of our watch, smartwatch and related products. As a result, we have been granted, and have pending, various U.S. and international design and utility patents related to certain product designs, features, and technologies. As of January 1, 2022, none of our patents were material to our business.
We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, particularly in the wearable technology space. We strive to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with current and prospective product development partners, confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others that may have access to our proprietary information and through the use of other security measures.
We aggressively protect our trademarks and trade dress and pursue infringement claims both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters both domestically and internationally through third-party online monitoring tools and through leads generated internally, as well as through our business partners worldwide.
Seasonality 
Our business has a seasonal pattern, with a significant portion of our sales occurring during the end-of-year holiday period.
Significant Customer
No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Competition
The businesses in which we compete are highly competitive and fragmented. The current market for traditional watches can be divided into tiers ranging from lower price point watches that are typically distributed through mass market channels to luxury watches at higher price points that are typically distributed through fine watch departments of upscale department stores or upscale specialty watch and fine jewelry stores. Our traditional watch business generally competes in these tiers with a number of established manufacturers, importers and distributors, including Armitron, Citizen, Gucci, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, LVMH Group, Movado, Raymond Weil, Seiko, Swatch, Swiss Army, TAG Heuer and Timex. In addition, our leather goods, sunglasses, and jewelry businesses compete with a large number of established companies that have significant experience developing, marketing and distributing such products. Our competitors include distributors that import watches and accessories from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories domestically.
We believe the risk of significant new competitors for traditional watches is mitigated to some extent by barriers to entry such as high startup costs and the development of long-term relationships with customers and manufacturing sources. However, in the expanding wearable technology industry, we face competition from technology brands such as Apple, Garmin and Samsung, from fitness brands such as Fitbit and from many established traditional watch manufacturers that have launched wearable technology products. As this industry evolves and grows, there will likely be increased competition as well. However, we believe our design and branding are strong competitive advantages.
Although the level and nature of competition varies among our product categories and geographic regions, we compete on the basis of style and technical features, price, value, quality, brand name, advertising, marketing, distribution and customer service. Our ability to identify and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences (including wearable 
technology), to maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with manufacturing sources, to deliver quality merchandise in a timely manner, to manage the retail sales process, and to continue to integrate technology into our business model are important factors in our ability to compete. Our distinctive business model of owning the distribution in many key markets and offering a globally recognized portfolio of proprietary and licensed products allows for many competitive advantages over smaller, regional or local competitors. This allows us to bypass a local distributor's cost structure in certain countries, resulting in more competitively priced products, while also generating higher product and operating margins.
Governmental Regulation
Imports and Import Restrictions
Most of our products are assembled or manufactured overseas. As a result, the U.S. and countries in which our products are sourced or sold may from time to time modify existing or impose new quotas, duties (including anti-dumping or countervailing duties), tariffs or other restrictions in a manner that adversely affects us. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of "most favored nation" status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. We cannot predict the effect these events would have on our operations, if any, especially in light of the concentration of our assembly and manufacturing operations in Hong Kong, and mainland China.
General
We are subject to laws regarding customs, tax, employment, privacy, truth-in-advertising, consumer product safety, zoning and occupancy and other laws and regulations that regulate and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of consumer products and our corporate, retail and distribution operations.
Compliance and Trade
Code of Conduct for Manufacturers ("Manufacturer Code")
We are committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations and respect for the rights of all individuals. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. In 2021, we joined the UN Global Compact and launched the Fossil Group Human Rights Policy. This further supports our commitment to human rights within our entire supply chain.
In addition, we are committed to compliance with applicable environmental requirements and are committed to seeing that all of our products are manufactured and distributed in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that our business partners will share these commitments, which we enforce through our Manufacturer Code.
Our Manufacturer Code specifically requires our manufacturers to not use child, forced or involuntary labor and to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We provide training to our factories related to our Manufacturer Code and the applicable laws in the country in which the factory is located. The training provides the factories with a more in-depth explanation of our Manufacturer Code.
In addition to the contractual obligation, we evaluate our suppliers' compliance with our Manufacturer Code through audits conducted both by our employees and third-party compliance auditing firms. In most cases, the audits are announced. If we believe that a supplier is failing to live up to the standards of our Manufacturer Code, we may terminate the supplier or provide the supplier with an opportunity to remedy the non-compliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan. 
Trade
Our warehouse and distribution facility in Dallas, Texas operates in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. This sub-zone provides the following economic and operational advantages to us: (i) we do not have to pay duty on imported merchandise until it leaves the sub-zone and enters the U.S. market; (ii) we do not have to pay any U.S. duty on merchandise if the imported merchandise is subsequently shipped to locations outside the U.S.; and (iii) we do not have to pay local property tax on inventory located within the sub-zone.
Information Systems
Enterprise Resource Planning
We utilize SAP ERP in our U.S. operations and throughout most of our European operations to support our human resources, sales and distribution, inventory planning, retail merchandising and operational and financial reporting systems of our business, and Navision in our Asian operations to support many of the same functions on a local country level. We also use tools provided by salesforce.com, inc. to support our brand websites globally as well as in our CRM initiatives.
Enterprise Performance Management Systems 
We have implemented customized Hyperion financial reporting software from Oracle Corporation. The software increases the efficiency of our consolidation and reporting process and provides a more dynamic way to view and analyze data. The Hyperion planning tool also provides more dynamic and robust budgeting and forecasting capabilities.
Point-of-Sale System
We plan to begin the global implementation of a new point-of-sale system in 2022 at our retail stores beginning in Europe with additional implementation in the Americas and Asia in 2023. This point-of-sale system will significantly enhance our omni-channel capabilities allowing us to better serve our customers across channels with inventory and fulfillment. 
We have global information security and privacy compliance programs, comprised of risk management policies and procedures for our information systems, cybersecurity practices and protection of consumer and employee personal data and confidential information. Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of the Company’s risk management policies and procedures, and has delegated primary responsibility for monitoring the risks and programs in this area to the Audit Committee, which receives quarterly updates on information security and privacy risk and compliance. The Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these topics as well. We have network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection in the event of certain covered cyber losses and data breaches.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 1, 2022, Fossil Group employed approximately 6,900 people, including approximately 4,500 persons employed by our foreign operating subsidiaries.
None of our domestic or foreign-based employees are represented by a trade union. However, certain European-based employees are represented by work councils, which includes a number of our current employees who negotiate with management on behalf of all the employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our working relationship with our employees and work councils to be good.
As a purpose driven consumer-centric organization that understands the value of a having a high performing, actively engaged workforce, we believe that our employees fuel our success and are the driving force in delivering our business objectives and creating value for our key stakeholders, including customers, investors, and partners. We consistently strive to be a responsible employer in everything we do, including attracting and employing the most talented people while retaining them over the long-term through employment opportunities, compensation and benefits, personal development, and the purpose-driven environment that we create together. 
Our Organization
Our approach to business achievement and our workplace culture continue to support our ability to be an employer of choice and elevate the collective strength of our workforce, which provides a competitive advantage through successful human resources management. Our values, which include authenticity, grit, curiosity, sense of humor and making an impact, are the foundation for our workplace policies and practices. 
By the numbers, our workforce is increasingly diverse. Globally, 35% of our employees are in the Americas; 32% are based in Europe; and 33% are in the Asia-Pacific region. Women represent 62% of our employees and men 38%. In the U.S., including corporate, retail and distribution employees, in the aggregate 57% of employees identify as black and indigenous people of color (“BIPOC”), 42% identify as white and 1% did not self-identify. 
We are committed to be a company that reflects our diverse world, and we will enable diversity and inclusion to fuel employee and Company success. We welcome fresh perspectives and believe that a diverse and inclusive workplace leads to innovation, collaboration, creativity, and personal and commercial growth. Over the past year, we expanded our inclusion trainings for employees, increased our focus on celebrating key cultural heritage and identity moments with our employees, customers and stakeholders and continued to create space for our employees to have meaningful discussions on topics and real-time incidents related to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”). Our three-year DE&I strategy was reviewed by a third-party, assuring we continue to push ourselves to become more inclusive. Our journey to become a more diverse workforce around the world is guided by five primary goals:
1.Growing our knowledge. We recognize DE&I is a journey and growing our knowledge is the foundation for our entire DE&I strategy. Our employees are at the center of this journey, providing them with opportunities to learn and grow through a variety of methods - online DE&I communities, continuing unconscious-bias education (required for certain employees), inclusion education (required for certain leaders), other broader DE&I topics and Fossil Group Gathering sessions, which provides our workforce the opportunity to discuss issues, incidents and moments impacting our diverse employee community.
2.Increasing our Diversity. We establish annual diversity and inclusion goals, which include increasing the overall number of BIPOC employees we employ. Our goals also include increasing female and BIPOC leadership, providing mentor programs for underrepresented groups and investing in female, BIPOC leadership. In the past year, female senior leadership increased to 35%. 
3.Creating a more inclusive and equitable environment for all employees. We were rated a best place to work for LGBTQ employees for the second year in a row by the Human Rights Campaign. We also launched five employee resource groups that focus on parents, female employees, Black/African American employees, Hispanic and Latino employees and LGBTQ employees. We continue to leverage our survey capabilities to understand employee engagement by gender and race. 
4.Driving accountability. We have taken steps to increase accountability by tying certain executive compensation to our DE&I goals, building key DE&I topics into our required leadership development programs and working to transparently share our diversity aspirations.
5.Leveraging our diversity to benefit external stakeholders. We continue to use our Company knowledge, achievement and influence to make a difference in our community. Additionally, we are actively engaged in multiple industry DE&I focused counsels, including the Black in Fashion Counsel, the Diversity in Design Collaborative and the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
Engaging the Fossil Group Workforce
We work to ensure that people in our workplace are and remain engaged. Our objective is to create a high-performance culture where people have the skills and behaviors to help fuel company results and be at their personal best, every day. 
Surveying our employees allows us to understand their perspective, what inspires them and how as an organization we can improve. Doing so helps to establish and sustain meaningful engagement. Consistent findings tell us that at the top of their list are the following: career growth and development, effective communication, recognition, a clear view of the Company’s future, compelling compensation and benefits, and the ability and opportunity to connect to something bigger. With regard to business success, the views of our employees are aligned with business needs to establish a workplace culture including:
•Comprehensive health and leading-edge wellness benefits;
•Innovative two-way communication;
•Value-creating employee development programs;
•Performance management through Company-sponsored time to grow;
•Meaningful recognition; and
•Values-based culture and work environment.
Our employee benefits also include tuition and professional certification and license reimbursement to full and part-time employees. We also work to create a workplace where families are a priority through a number of programs, including the following: a parental leave program; a partnership with Milk Stork providing a simple solution to help working mothers to continue to breastfeed and reduce business-travel stress; a Healthy Babies Program that supports parents during their pregnancy; and an enhanced return to work policy that allows new parents to phase back into work. Additionally, our WeCare Employee Emergency Assistance Fund is also in place to provide charitable assistance to employees facing financial and personal hardship in connection with a qualifying disaster or unforeseen hardship.
By offering extensive retail and corporate career development programs employees have the opportunity to be positioned for continued success, which is further supported through our performance process that effectively cascades goals throughout the organization to ensure our employees’ efforts are aligned with our strategic priorities. 
Our continued focus on the employee has resulted in strong employee engagement and retention during a time when employees are leaving jobs at unprecedented rates. Our 12-month corporate employee turnover rate remains consistent with our five-year employee turnover rate. In our distribution centers, we’ve improved our 12-month retention rate, with the turnover rate decreasing overall.
The Future of the Fossil Group Workforce
As we look towards the future workplace, we used the past year to listen and understand how to create the best employee experience, while driving our business forward. The outcome resulted in us evolving the way we get work done and introducing a hybrid work model, offering our employees the opportunity to work at home and in our offices. We believe balancing the need for greater flexibility with the importance of in-person interactions to fuel creative thinking, execution, and employee growth enables us to drive the business collectively. To ensure we have the skillsets we need to be successful we also introduced the opportunity for select roles to work remotely full-time from anywhere.
As we continue to drive to become a digital powerhouse, we’ve made significant increases in our digital infrastructure, most notably our talented employees. Led by our newly hired Chief Digital Officer, we have continued to invest in talent and skillsets with a number of new hires who we specifically recruited to help drive our digital transformation and fuel e-commerce growth.
Oversight
Our Board of Directors and related committees are actively involved in areas associated with excellence in human resources management and related oversight of certain policies, practices and outcomes – including compensation, diversity and inclusion, employee development, engagement, and succession planning. We share our employee survey results with our Board of Directors to keep them apprised of related sentiment, interests and concerns. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee helps to oversee ESG matters. The Audit Committee regularly participates in discussions with our leadership team to ensure oversight of enterprise-level risks and mitigation plans on various topics including those associated with human capital risk. The Audit Committee also engages in regular review of the Company’s monitoring and enforcement of our Code of Conduct and Ethics and compliance. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves matters associated with compensation, benefits and related equity awards for qualifying employees. This work includes proper oversight of executive compensation and Company goals that are part of executives’ performance review. These same goals serve as the foundation for the Company’s employee annual cash bonus plan.
The Global Pandemic and Our Employee-Friendly Response
The human tragedy created by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to lead us to do everything possible to slow the spread of the virus and protect our employees, customers and suppliers, as we closely adhere to health and safety guidelines established by the Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and state, county and community governments. 
In the midst of the pandemic, we continued to enable our employees to work remotely, when possible, and provided related health and safety training and resources.
As we planned for a safe return to work, we surveyed our employees multiple times with the intent of understanding comfort levels working in an office environment, and their preferred working environments as a result of how our workforce shifted to operate during the pandemic. We listened to and collaborated with our employees to evolve our future way of working. 
As employees return to the workplace, we will continue to implement extensive health and safety guidelines that may include daily wellness checks, temperature checks, the required use of masks for employees and customers, and social distancing while also providing and amplifying cleaning and sanitization practices. Additionally, during the pandemic we have offered onsite vaccination clinics for our employees and offered paid time away from work to get vaccinated as well as time for employees who may have experienced side effects resulting from the vaccine. As the pandemic evolves and medical advances continue, we will continue to assess how we can support our workforce and put the health and safety of our employees first.
We are proud of the progress we have made to provide an inspiring, engaging and rewarding work environment for our employees. We will never stop nurturing our culture in this quickly changing world. To exceed expectations and achieve our aspirations, we will listen, learn, collaborate, set meaningful goals, innovate, and be transparent in our progress, challenges and opportunities that make Fossil Group a destination for high performing, highly engaged talent. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
As a global fashion leader, we recognize the impact that our operations can have on the environment and the social well-being of others. We have developed a corporate social responsibility strategy in order to drive positive change within our organization and our world. Our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy outlines our global strategy to achieve significant, measurable goals across a range of important environmental and social sustainability issues. See “Operating Strategy” — “Make Time for Good.”
Our Company’s corporate social responsibility strategy is called Make Time for Good and is divided into three areas:
•Good for Planet – focused on actions across our operations and supply chain, meant to significantly reduce our environmental impact, through our designing for the future and leaving a light footprint initiatives.
•Good for Communities – focused on making our world a better place to live through our empowering women and girls and enhancing communities initiatives.
•Good for People – focused on our employees and enhancing our workplace culture through our driving diversity and inclusion and advancing equality initiatives. 
We expect to release our first Corporate Social Responsibility report in 2022.
