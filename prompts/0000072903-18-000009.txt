ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS
NSP-Minnesota
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s operations are regulated by the MPUC, the NDPSC and the SDPUC within their respective states. The MPUC also has regulatory authority over security issuances, property transfers, mergers, dispositions of assets and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s IRPs for meeting customers’ future energy needs. The MPUC also certifies the need and siting for generating plants greater than 50 MW and transmission lines greater than 100 KV that will be located within the state. No large power plant or transmission line may be constructed in Minnesota except on a site or route designated by the MPUC. The NDPSC and SDPUC have regulatory authority over generation and transmission facilities, along with the siting and routing of new generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota and South Dakota, respectively.
NSP-Minnesota is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transfers and mergers, and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. NSP-Minnesota is a transmission owning member of the MISO RTO and operates within the MISO RTO and MISO wholesale market. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are jointly authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 
Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Minnesota has several retail adjustment clauses that recover fuel, purchased energy and other resource costs:

• | CIP rider — Recovers the costs of conservation and demand-side management programs.


• | EIR — Recovers the costs of environmental improvement projects.


• | RDF — Allocates money collected from retail customers to support the research and development of emerging renewable energy projects and technologies.


• | RES — Recovers the cost of renewable generation in Minnesota.


• | RER — Recovers the cost of renewable generation in North Dakota.


• | SEP — Recovers costs related to various energy policies approved by the Minnesota legislature.


• | TCR — Recovers costs associated with investments in electric transmission and distribution grid modernization costs.


• | Infrastructure rider — Recovers costs for investments in generation and incremental property taxes in South Dakota.

NSP-Minnesota’s retail electric rates in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota include a FCA for monthly billing adjustments to recover changes in prudently incurred costs of fuel related items and purchased energy. In general, capacity costs are recovered through base rates and are not recovered through the FCA. In addition, costs associated with MISO are generally recovered through either the FCA or base rates. In 2017, the MPUC voted to change the process in which utilities seek fuel cost recovery under the FCA in Minnesota to be implemented in July 2019. Under the new process, each month utilities would collect amounts equal to the baseline cost of energy set at the start of the plan year. Monthly variations to the baseline costs would be tracked and netted over a 12-month period. Subsequently, utilities would issue refunds above the baseline costs, and could seek recovery of any overage. 
Minnesota state law requires NSP-Minnesota to invest two percent of its state electric revenues and half a percent of its state gas revenues in CIP. These costs are recovered through an annual cost-recovery mechanism for electric conservation and energy management program expenditures. Minnesota state law also requires NSP-Minnesota to submit a CIP plan at least every three years.
Capacity and Demand
Uninterrupted system peak demand for the NSP System’s electric utility for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2018, assuming normal weather conditions, is as follows:

 | System Peak Demand (in MW)
 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2018 Forecast
NSP System | 8,546 | | 9,002 | | 8,621 | 9,208

9

The peak demand for the NSP System typically occurs in the summer. The 2017 system peak demand for the NSP System occurred on July 17, 2017. The decline in peak load from 2016 to 2017 is in part due to considerably cooler weather in 2017. The 2018 forecast assumes normal peak day weather, which is warmer than actual 2017 peak day weather. 
Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives
NSP-Minnesota expects to use existing power plants, power purchases, CIP/DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of existing power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.
Purchased Power — NSP-Minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs. Generally, long-term dispatchable purchased power contracts require a periodic capacity payment and a charge for the delivered associated energy. Some long-term purchased power contracts only contain a charge for the purchased energy. NSP-Minnesota also makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, to replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance or during outages, to meet operating reserve obligations, or to obtain energy at a lower cost.
Purchased Transmission Services — NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.
NSP System Resource Plans — In January 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s IRP that includes:

• | Retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023 and Sherco Unit 1 in 2026. The resulting need for 750 MW of capacity in 2026 will be addressed in a future CON proceeding; 


• | Acquisition of at least 1,000 MW of wind by 2019. The mix of purchased power and owned facilities was not specified; 


• | Acquisition of 650 MW of solar by 2021 either through the community solar gardens program or other cost-effective resources. The mix of purchased power and owned facilities was not specified; 


• | Acquisition of at least 400 MW of additional demand response by 2023, and a study of the technical and economic achievability of 1,000 MW of additional demand response in total by 2025; and


• | Achievement of at least 444 GWh of energy efficiency in all planning years.

Minnesota Legislation — In February 2017, the Minnesota governor signed a bill into law allowing NSP-Minnesota to build a natural gas combined-cycle power plant at NSP-Minnesota’s Sherco site. The plant was originally proposed as part of NSP-Minnesota’s resource plan, which enables the retirement of two coal units at the Sherco site. The plant’s in-service date is anticipated for 2026. Cost recovery of the plant will be subject to MPUC approval.
Wind Development — In July 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s proposal to add 1,550 MW of new wind generation including ownership of 1,150 MW of wind generation by NSP-Minnesota, which will help achieve NSP-Minnesota’s wind acquisition goal outlined in the IRP. In March 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed an Advanced Determination of Prudence with the NDPSC and reached a settlement with the NDPSC Staff. The timing of a NDPSC order is uncertain. These projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and would qualify for 100 percent of the PTC. NSP-Minnesota’s total capital investment for these wind ownership projects is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion. 
In September 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed with the MPUC seeking approval to build and own the Dakota Range project, a 300 MW wind project in South Dakota. The project is expected to be placed into service by the end of 2021 and qualify for 80 percent of the PTC. The DOC recommended the MPUC deny the petition on the basis that NSP-Minnesota did not follow the standard regulatory selection process of issuing a new RFP. However, the DOC acknowledged the Dakota Range project would benefit ratepayers and the MPUC could approve the project if it determines the public interest outweighs their concern about the regulatory selection process. 
These wind projects are expected to provide significant savings to NSP-Minnesota’s customers and substantial environmental benefits. Projected savings/benefits assume fuel costs and generation mix consistent with various commission approved resource plans. NSP-Minnesota will provide supplemental filings to the MPUC in March 2018, which will estimate impacts of the TCJA on the wind projects.
10

PPA Terminations and Amendments — In 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed requests with the MPUC and the NDPSC for several initiatives including changes to four PPAs to reduce future costs for customers. These actions include the following:

• | The termination of a PPA with Benson Power LLC (Benson) for its 55 MW biomass facility in Benson, Minn., including the purchase and closure of the facility. The purchase of the Benson biomass facility requires FERC approval, which was requested in August 2017. The transaction would result in payments of $95 million to terminate the PPA and acquire the facility, as well as additional expenditures of approximately $26 million to temporarily operate and close the facility. 


• | The termination of a PPA with Laurentian Energy Authority I, LLC (Laurentian) for its 35 MW of biomass facilities in Hibbing and Virginia, Minn. The termination of the Laurentian PPA would result in approximately $109 million of contract cancellation payments over six years. 


• | The remaining two requested PPA changes involve a PPA extension of the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC) 34 MW waste-to-energy facility at a price reflective of current market conditions and termination of the Pine Bend 12 MW waste-to-energy PPA.

In November 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s request to terminate the Pine Bend PPA but rejected its request to extend the HERC PPA.
In January 2018, the MPUC issued an order approving NSP-Minnesota’s petition to terminate the PPAs with Benson and Laurentian, as well as purchase and close the Benson biomass facility. All approved costs are expected to be recoverable through the FCA, including a return on NSP-Minnesota’s total investment in the Benson transaction through 2028. NSP-Minnesota also reached a settlement agreement with the NDPSC Staff which allows for the termination of the PPAs with Benson, Laurentian and Pine Bend, as well as the purchase and closure of the Benson biomass facility. The NDPSC is expected to issue an order on the settlement in the second quarter of 2018. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin will jointly request FERC approval to modify the Interchange Agreement to share a portion of the termination costs with NSP-Wisconsin. 
These terminations and amendments are intended to provide in excess of $600 million in net cost savings to NSP System customers over the next 10 years.
Jurisdictional Cost Recovery Allocation — In December 2016, NSP-Minnesota filed a resource treatment framework with the NDPSC and MPUC. The filing proposed a framework to allow NSP-Minnesota’s operations in North Dakota and Minnesota to gradually become more independent of one another with respect to future generation resource selection while also identifying a path for cost sharing of current resources. NSP-Minnesota’s filing identified two options: a legal separation, creating a separate North Dakota operating company; or a pseudo-separation, which maintains the current corporate structure but directly assigns the costs and benefits of each resource to the jurisdiction that supports it. In October 2017, NDPSC staff filed testimony recommending no change to the current system of proxy pricing and policy-based disallowances claiming there is a likelihood of overall increased costs and potential loss of resource diversity. Hearings are planned for the second quarter of 2018.
Minnesota State Right-Of-First Refusal (ROFR) Statute Complaint — In September 2017, LSP Transmission Holdings, LLC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota (Minnesota District Court) against the Minnesota Attorney General, the MPUC and the DOC. The complaint was in response to MISO assigning NSP-Minnesota and ITC Midwest, LLC to jointly own a new 345 KV transmission line from near Mankato, Minn. to Winnebago, Minn. The line was estimated by MISO to cost $103 million. The project was assigned to NSP-Minnesota and ITC Midwest as the incumbent utilities, consistent with a Minnesota state ROFR statute. The complaint challenges the constitutionality of the state ROFR statute and is seeking declaratory judgment that the statute violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and should not be enforced. The Minnesota state agencies and NSP-Minnesota filed motions to dismiss. Oral arguments were heard in February 2018, and the matter is now pending before the Minnesota District Court. The timing and outcome of the litigation is uncertain.
Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal
NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the PI plant. Nuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes which are controlled by federal regulation. High-level radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. LLW consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment that have become contaminated through use in a plant.
11

NSP-Minnesota participates with regulators and in industry groups including the NRC, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations and Utilities Service Alliance to stay informed of advancements in nuclear safety, mitigation strategies, performance and operational effectiveness. NSP-Minnesota applies this acquired knowledge by investing in technology and services that improve nuclear operations and detect, mitigate and protect NPS-Minnesota’s nuclear facilities. 
NRC Regulation — The NRC regulates nuclear operations. Decisions by the NRC can significantly impact the operations of the nuclear generating plants. The costs of complying with NRC orders and requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs in customer rates, and expects future compliance costs will continue to be recoverable from customers. Estimates of the future nuclear capital expenditures related to costs of NRC compliance are included in Xcel Energy’s capital forecast for electric generation. See Item 7 for further discussion of capital requirements.
Nuclear Regulatory Performance — The NRC has a Reactor Oversight Process that classifies U.S. nuclear reactors into various categories (referred to as Columns, from 1 to 5).  Issues are evaluated as either green, white, yellow, or red based on their safety significance, with green representing the least safety concern and red representing the most concern.  
As of Dec. 31, 2017, Monticello and PI Units 1 and 2 were in Column 1 (licensee response) with all green performance indicators and no greater than green findings or violations. Plants in Column 1 are subject to only a pre-defined set of basic NRC inspections.
LLW Disposal — LLW from NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello and PI nuclear plants is currently disposed at the Clive facility located in Utah and the Waste Control Specialists facility located in Texas. If off-site LLW disposal facilities become unavailable, NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site at PI and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their current licensed lives.
High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal — The federal government has the responsibility to permanently dispose of domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to implement a program for nuclear high-level waste management. This includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent federal storage or disposal facility. The federal government has been evaluating a nuclear geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada for many years. At this time, there are no definitive plans for a permanent federal storage site at Yucca Mountain or any other site.
Review of PI Costs — As part of NSP-Minnesota’s 2016 multi-year electric rate case and IRP the MPUC ordered an investigation into NSP-Minnesota’s PI nuclear investments. The issue was resolved for the 2016 multi-year electric rate case settlement; however the DOC is continuing to investigate costs of operation and performance at PI in anticipation of NSP-Minnesota’s 2019 resource plan.
Nuclear Spent Fuel Storage
NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear generating plants. As of Dec. 31, 2017, there were 40 casks loaded and stored at the PI plant and 16 canisters loaded and stored at the Monticello plant. An additional 24 casks for PI and 14 canisters for Monticello have been authorized by the State of Minnesota. This currently authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until the end of the operating licenses in 2030 for Monticello, 2033 for PI Unit 1, and 2034 for PI Unit 2. Authorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not begin operation of a consolidated interim storage installation.
In 2013, NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello nuclear generating plant loaded and placed five storage canisters (canisters #11-15) in the ISFSI and a sixth canister (canister #16) was loaded but remained in the plant pending resolution of weld inspection issues.  Successful pressure and leak testing demonstrated the safety and integrity of all six canisters involved. NSP-Minnesota took several actions to assure compliance with the NRC’s regulations and Monticello’s storage license.
In 2016, the NRC issued an order approving a settlement in which NSP-Minnesota agreed to a timeline for attaining compliance on all six canisters, as well as additional training and communications. During 2016, the NRC approved an exemption request for the completion of canister #16.  That canister is now considered in compliance, and was placed in the ISFSI during 2016.  In 2017, NSP-Minnesota submitted a plan and request to the NRC to restore Monticello canisters #11-15 to compliance through an exemption request.  NSP-Minnesota requested that the NRC grant the exemption by October 2018.
Costs attributable to Monticello canisters #11-15 achieving full regulatory compliance within five years are currently being evaluated.  No public safety issues have been raised, or are believed to exist, in this matter.

See Items 1A and 7 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs.
Fuel Sources
Nuclear — NSP-Minnesota secures contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication to operate its nuclear plants. The contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases and medium and long-term contracts for uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services with multiple producers and with a focus on diversification to minimize potential impacts caused by supply interruptions due to geographical and world political issues.

• | Current nuclear fuel supply contracts cover 100 percent of uranium concentrates requirements through 2021 and approximately 57 percent of the requirements for 2022 through 2033;


• | Current contracts for conversion services cover 100 percent of the requirements through 2021 and approximately 50 percent of the requirements for 2022 through 2033; and


• | Current enrichment service contracts cover 100 percent of the requirements through 2025 and approximately 29 percent of the requirements for 2026 through 2033.

Fabrication services for Monticello and PI are 100 percent committed through 2030 and 2019, respectively. 
13

NSP-Minnesota expects sufficient uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services to be available for the total fuel requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Some exposure to market price volatility will remain due to index-based pricing structures contained in certain supply contracts.
Coal — The NSP System normally maintains approximately 41 days of coal inventory. Coal supply inventories at Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 53 and 55 days of usage, respectively. Milder weather, purchase commitments and relatively low power and natural gas prices resulted in coal inventories being above optimal levels. NSP-Minnesota’s generation stations use low-sulfur western coal purchased primarily under contracts with suppliers operating in Wyoming and Montana. Coal requirements for the NSP System’s major coal-fired generating plants were approximately 8.0 million tons for 2017 and 7.5 million tons for 2016. Coal requirements for 2017 increased primarily due to slightly higher natural gas prices during the year. The estimated coal requirements for 2018 are approximately 8.3 million tons. 
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracted for coal supplies to provide 79 percent of their estimated coal requirements in 2018 and a declining percentage of the requirements in subsequent years. The NSP System’s general coal purchasing objective is to contract for approximately 75 percent of requirements for the first year, 40 percent of requirements in year two and 20 percent of requirements in year three. Remaining requirements will be filled through the procurement process or over-the-counter transactions.
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have coal transportation contracts that provide for delivery of 100 and 25 percent of their coal requirements in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Coal delivery may be subject to interruptions or reductions due to operation of the mines, transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment.
Natural gas — The NSP System uses both firm and interruptible natural gas supply in combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas supplies, transportation and storage services for power plants are procured under contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel. However, as natural gas primarily serves intermediate and peak demand, remaining forecasted requirements are able to be procured through a liquid spot market. Generally, natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing that is tied to various natural gas indices. Most transportation contract pricing is based on FERC approved transportation tariff rates. Certain natural gas supply and transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, the NSP System did not have any commitments related to gas supply contracts; however commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts were approximately $398 million and $382 million, respectively. Commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts expire in various years from 2018 to 2037.
The NSP System also has limited on-site fuel oil storage facilities and primarily relies on the spot market for incremental supplies.
Renewable Energy Sources
The NSP System’s renewable energy portfolio includes wind, hydroelectric, biomass and solar power from both owned generating facilities and PPAs. As of Dec. 31, 2017, the NSP System was in compliance with mandated RPS, which require generation from renewable resources of 25.0 percent and 12.9 percent of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin electric retail sales, respectively. 
Renewable energy as a percentage of the NSP System’s total energy:

 | 2017 | | 2016
Renewable | 28.8 | % | | 26.1 | %
Wind | 18.3 | | | 16.4 | 
Hydroelectric | 6.3 | | | 6.6 | 
Biomass and solar | 4.2 | | | 3.1 | 

The NSP System also offers customer-focused renewable energy initiatives. Windsource allows customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan to purchase electricity from renewable sources. The number of customers utilizing Windsource increased to approximately 60,900 in 2017 from 54,000 in 2016. 
14

Additionally, to encourage the growth of solar energy in Minnesota, customers are offered incentives to install solar panels on their homes and businesses under the Solar*Rewards® and Made in Minnesota solar incentive programs. Over 2,800 PV systems with approximately 33.75 MW of aggregate capacity have been installed in Minnesota as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2,000 PV systems with approximately 25.2 MW of aggregate capacity were installed as of Dec. 31, 2016. The Solar*Rewards® Community® program is another option made available to encourage use of solar energy in Minnesota. This program allows for offsite development of solar and bill credits to customers based on an approved tariffed rate. 

Wind — The NSP System acquires the majority of its wind energy from PPAs. Currently, the NSP System has more than 130 of these agreements in place, with facilities ranging in size from under one MW to more than 200 MW. The NSP System owns and operates five wind farms which have the capacity to generate 852 MW.

• | The NSP System had approximately 2,600 MW of wind energy on its system at the end of 2017 and 2016. In addition to receiving purchased wind energy under these agreements, the NSP System typically receives wind RECs, which are used to meet state renewable resource requirements. 


• | The average cost per MWh of wind energy under existing contracts was approximately $44 for 2017 and $43 for 2016. The cost per MWh of wind energy varies by contract and may be influenced by a number of factors including regulation, state-specific renewable resource requirements and the year of contract execution. Generally, contracts executed in 2017 continued to benefit from improvements in technology, excess capacity among manufacturers and motivation to commence new construction prior to the anticipated expiration of the federal PTCs. In December 2015, the federal PTCs were extended through 2019 with a phase down on sites that began construction in 2017. 

Hydroelectric — The NSP System acquires its hydroelectric energy from both owned generation and PPAs. The NSP System owns 20 hydroelectric plants throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota which provide approximately 263 MW of capacity. For 2017, PPAs provided approximately 34 MW of hydroelectric capacity. Additionally, the NSP System purchases approximately 850 MW of generation from Manitoba Hydro, which is sourced primarily from its fleet of hydroelectric facilities.
Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations
NSP-Minnesota conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy-related products. NSP-Minnesota uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. NSP-Minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging and sharing of any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement. NSP-Minnesota does not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates. See Item 7 for further discussion.
NSP-Wisconsin
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Wisconsin’s operations are regulated by the PSCW and the MPSC, within their respective states. In addition, each of the state commissions certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines before the facilities may be sited and built. NSP-Wisconsin is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. NSP- Wisconsin is a transmission owning member of the MISO RTO and operates within the MISO RTO and wholesale energy market. NSP-Wisconsin and NSP-Minnesota are jointly authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 
The PSCW has a biennial base rate filing requirement. By June of each odd numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test year beginning the following January. In recent years, NSP-Wisconsin has been submitting rate filings each year.
15

Fuel and Purchased Energy Cost Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause for Wisconsin retail customers. Instead, under Wisconsin rules, utilities submit a forward-looking annual fuel cost plan to the PSCW for approval. Once the PSCW approves the fuel cost plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a two percent annual tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of deferred costs is determined by the PSCW. Rate recovery of deferred fuel cost is subject to an earnings test based on the utility’s most recently authorized ROE. Fuel cost under-collections that exceed the two percent annual tolerance band may not be recovered if the utility earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.
NSP-Wisconsin’s electric fuel costs for 2017 were lower than authorized in rates and outside the two percent annual tolerance band, primarily due to lower purchased power costs coupled with moderate weather and generation sales into the MISO market.  Under the fuel cost recovery rules, NSP-Wisconsin may retain approximately $4 million of fuel costs and defer approximately $10 million through Dec. 31, 2017. NSP-Wisconsin will file a reconciliation of 2017 fuel costs with the PSCW.  The amount of any potential refund is subject to review and approval by the PSCW, which is not expected until mid-2018.
NSP-Wisconsin’s retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include power supply cost recovery factors, which are based on 12-month projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-recoveries are refunded and any under-recoveries are collected from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.
Wisconsin Energy Efficiency Program — In Wisconsin, the primary energy efficiency program is funded by the state’s utilities, but operated by independent contractors subject to oversight by the PSCW and the utilities. NSP-Wisconsin recovers these costs in rates charged to Wisconsin retail customers.
Capacity and Demand
NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota. See NSP-Minnesota Capacity and Demand.
Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives
NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota. See NSP-Minnesota Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives.
NSP-Wisconsin / American Transmission Company, LLC (ATC) - La Crosse to Madison, Wis. Transmission Line — In 2013, NSP-Wisconsin and ATC jointly filed an application with the PSCW for a CPCN for a 345 KV transmission line that would extend from La Crosse, Wis. to Madison, Wis.  NSP-Wisconsin’s half of the line will be shared with three co-owners, Dairyland Power Cooperative, WPPI Energy and Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency-Wisconsin.
In 2015, the PSCW issued its order approving a CPCN and route for the project. Two groups have appealed the CPCN order to the La Crosse County Circuit Court (Circuit Court). In May 2017, the Circuit Court determined that the project was necessary, allowing construction to continue on a seven mile segment near La Crosse, Wis. The parties have appealed various aspects of the case to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals which is currently pending. The CPCN remains in full effect unless one of the parties seeks and receives a stay from the court and posts a bond to cover damages the utilities may incur due to delay. The 180-mile project is expected to cost approximately $541 million. NSP-Wisconsin’s portion of the investment, which includes AFUDC, is estimated to be approximately $200 million. Construction on the line began in January 2016, with completion anticipated by late 2018.

PSCo
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — PSCo is regulated by the CPUC with respect to its facilities, rates, accounts, services and issuance of securities. PSCo is regulated by the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, accounting practices, hydroelectric licensing, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with the NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. PSCo is not presently a member of an RTO and does not operate within an RTO energy market. PSCo is authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices to customers outside PSCo’s balancing authority area.
Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — PSCo has several retail adjustment clauses that recover fuel, purchased energy and other resource costs:

• | ECA — Recovers fuel and purchased energy costs. Short-term sales margins are shared with retail customers through the ECA. The ECA is revised quarterly. 


• | PCCA — Recovers purchased capacity payments.


• | SCA — Recovers the difference between PSCo’s actual cost of fuel and the amount of these costs recovered under its base steam service rates. The SCA rate is revised on a quarterly basis. 


• | DSMCA — Recovers DSM, interruptible service costs and performance initiatives for achieving energy savings goals.


• | RESA — Recovers the incremental costs of compliance with the RES with a maximum of two percent of the customer’s bill.


• | WCA — Premium service for customers who choose to pay for renewable resources.


• | TCA — Recovers costs associated with transmission investment outside of rate cases.


• | CACJA — Recovers costs associated with the CACJA.

PSCo recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale electric customers through a fuel cost adjustment clause approved by the FERC. PSCo’s wholesale customers pay the full cost of certain renewable energy purchase and generation costs through a fuel clause and in exchange receive RECs associated with those resources. The wholesale customers pay their jurisdictional allocation of production costs through a fully forecasted formula rate with true-up.
Capacity and Demand
Uninterrupted system peak demand for PSCo’s electric utility for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2018, assuming normal weather conditions, is as follows:

 | System Peak Demand (in MW)
 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2018 Forecast
PSCo | 6,671 | | 6,585 | | 6,284 | 6,462

The peak demand for PSCo’s system typically occurs in the summer. The 2017 system peak demand for PSCo occurred on July 19, 2017. The 2017 system peak demand was higher than 2016 due to warmer July summer weather. The forecast of system peak assumes normal weather conditions.
Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives
PSCo expects to meet its system capacity requirements through existing electric generating stations, power purchases, new generation facilities, DSM options and phased expansion of existing generation at select power plants.
Purchased Power — PSCo has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require a periodic capacity charge and an energy charge for energy actually purchased. PSCo also contracts to purchase power for both wind and solar resources. In addition, PSCo makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, to replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance or during outages, to meet operating reserve obligations, or to obtain energy at a lower cost.
Purchased Transmission Services — In addition to using its own transmission system, PSCo has contracts with regional transmission service providers to deliver energy to PSCo’s customers.
17

Rush Creek Wind Ownership Proposal — In 2016, the CPUC granted PSCo a CPCN to build, own and operate a 600 MW wind generation facility in Colorado at Rush Creek. The CPCN includes a hard cost-cap of $1.096 billion (including transmission costs) and a capital cost sharing mechanism between customers and PSCo of 82.5 percent to customers and 17.5 percent to PSCo for every $10 million the project comes in below the cost-cap.
All major contracts required to complete the project have been executed. PTC components for safe harboring the facility have been fabricated and construction began in April 2017.
Investment costs will be recovered through the RESA and ECA riders until PSCo’s next rate case following Rush Creek’s in-service date. The wind generation facility is anticipated to be in service in October 2018.
Colorado Energy Plan (CEP) — In 2016, PSCo filed its 2016 Electric Resource Plan (ERP) which included the estimated need for additional generation resources through spring of 2024. In 2017, PSCo filed an updated capacity need with the CPUC of 450 MW in 2023.
In August 2017, PSCo and various other stakeholders filed a stipulation agreement proposing the CEP, an alternative plan that increases the amount of new resources sought under the ERP. The CEP would increase PSCo’s potential capacity need up to 1,110 MW due to the proposed retirement of two coal units. The major components include:

• | Early retirement of 660 MWs of coal-fired generation at Comanche Units 1 (2022) and 2 (2025);


• | Accelerated depreciation for the early retirement of the two Comanche units and establishment of a regulatory asset to collect the incremental depreciation expense and related costs;


• | A RFP for up to 1,000 MW of wind, 700 MW of solar and 700 MW of natural gas and/or storage;


• | Utility ownership targets of 50 percent renewable generation resources and 75 percent of natural gas-fired, storage, or renewable with storage generation resources;


• | Reduction of the RESA rider, from two percent to one percent effective beginning 2021 or 2022; and


• | Construction of a new transmission switching station to further the development of renewable generating resources.

Hearings were held in February 2018 with two parties opposing both the coal retirements and utility ownership. Fifteen parties in the proceeding support the CEP. The CPUC is expected to rule on the stipulation agreement in March 2018. PSCo is currently evaluating bids from a RFP and anticipates filing its recommended portfolios in April 2018. A CPUC decision on the recommended portfolio is anticipated in the summer of 2018.
Approval of the CEP portfolio could increase capital investment up to $1.5 billion, based on a preliminary estimate. The level of capital investment may decline due to lower renewable pricing and the ultimate composition of assets selected as part of the RFP process. The expected cost and potential capital investment of the CEP will be determined once a recommended portfolio is filed with the CPUC. The CEP portfolio is not included in PSCo and Xcel Energy’s base capital expenditures forecast. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of the capital forecast.
Boulder, Colorado Municipalization — In 2011, in the City of Boulder, Colorado (Boulder), voters passed a ballot measure authorizing the formation of an electric municipal utility, subject to certain conditions. Since that time, there have been various legal proceedings in multiple venues with jurisdiction over Boulder’s plan. In 2014, the Boulder City Council passed an ordinance to establish an electric utility. PSCo challenged the formation of this utility as premature and the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in PSCo’s favor, vacating a lower court decision. Subsequently, the Colorado Supreme Court granted Boulder’s petition to review the Court of Appeals decision and oral arguments were held on Feb. 14, 2018. A ruling on the petition is anticipated in 2018. 
In 2015, the Boulder District Court (District Court) affirmed a prior CPUC decision that Boulder cannot serve customers outside its city limits; these customers were included in Boulder’s plan at the time. The District Court also ruled the CPUC has jurisdiction over the transfer of any facilities to Boulder and in determining how the systems are separated. Further, the District Court found that the CPUC must give approval before Boulder files any condemnation proceeding. Boulder does not have authorization to initiate a condemnation proceeding at this time. 
18

Boulder has filed multiple separation applications, the most recent one being in May 2017, which was challenged by PSCo and other intervenors. In September 2017, the CPUC issued a written decision, agreeing with several key aspects of PSCo’s position, stating PSCo is not required to undertake many of Boulder’s proposals, such as acting as a financier and contractor for Boulder. Additionally, the CPUC approved the designation of some electrical distribution assets for transfer, subject to Boulder completing certain items, including: 

• | Filing an agreement between Boulder and PSCo providing permanent rights for PSCo to place and access facilities in Boulder needed to continue to serve its customers;


• | Filing a complete and accurate revised list of distribution assets desired to be transferred; and


• | Filing an agreement to address payments from Boulder to PSCo for costs of Boulder’s municipalization efforts.

Boulder has requested that the CPUC grant an extension through March 13, 2018 to complete such filings. Once those filings have been submitted, additional hearings may be held.
In November 2017, Boulder voters passed certain measures regarding Boulder’s pursuit of municipalization, including an extension and increase of the Utility Occupational Tax for funding Boulder’s exploration of municipalization.
MWTG — PSCo, along with nine other electric service providers from the Rocky Mountain region, have been considering creating and operating a joint transmission tariff to increase wholesale market efficiency and improve regional transmission planning.  In September 2017, the MWTG determined that membership in the SPP RTO could provide opportunities to reduce customer costs, and maximize resource and electric grid utilization. In October 2017, the MWTG commenced negotiations with SPP through the SPP public stakeholder process. 
SPP’s Board of Directors and organizational groups have begun to address the MWTG’s proposed terms for integration into the SPP RTO. Should the MWTG decide to move forward, SPP would make filings with the FERC and PSCo would make filings with the CPUC and the FERC, in the later part of 2018. If approved, MWTG operations within the SPP RTO would not be expected to begin until late 2019 at the earliest. PSCo recently engaged a consultant to conduct an analysis of the benefits associated with membership in the SPP RTO. The analysis assumed gas price forecasts that are lower than gas price forecasts used by the other MWTG utilities in their analysis of the benefits associated with membership in the SPP RTO. PSCo is in the process of evaluating that analysis.

Fuel Sources
Coal — PSCo normally maintains approximately 35 - 50 days of coal inventory. Coal supply inventories at Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 48 and 36 days of usage, respectively. PSCo has contracted for coal supply to provide 75 percent of its 9.1 million tons of estimated coal requirements in 2018, and a declining percentage of requirements in subsequent years. PSCo’s general coal purchasing objective is to contract for approximately 75 percent of requirements for the first year, 40 percent of requirements in year two, and 20 percent of requirements in year three. Remaining requirements will be filled through the procurement process or over-the-counter transactions.
PSCo has coal transportation contracts that provide for delivery of 100 percent its coal requirements in 2018 and 2019. Coal delivery may be subject to interruptions or reductions due to operation of the mines, transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment.
Natural gas — PSCo uses both firm and interruptible natural gas supply in combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas supplies for PSCo’s power plants are procured under contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel. However, as natural gas primarily serves intermediate and peak demand, any remaining forecasted requirements are able to be procured through a liquid spot market. The majority of natural gas supply under contract is covered by a long-term agreement with Anadarko Energy Services Company and the balance of natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing features tied to changes in various natural gas indices. PSCo hedges a portion of that risk through financial instruments. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Most transportation contract pricing is based on FERC approved transportation tariff rates. Certain natural gas supply and transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. 

• | At Dec. 31, 2017, PSCo’s commitments related to gas supply contracts, which expire between 2021 through 2023, were approximately $545 million and commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts, which expire between 2018 through 2040, were approximately $620 million.


• | At Dec. 31, 2016, PSCo’s commitments related to gas supply contracts were approximately $654 million and commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts were approximately $573 million.

PSCo has limited on-site fuel oil storage facilities and primarily relies on the spot market for incremental supplies.

Renewable Energy Sources
PSCo’s renewable energy portfolio includes wind, hydroelectric, biomass and solar power from both owned generating facilities and PPAs. As of Dec. 31, 2017, PSCo was in compliance with mandated RPS, which requires generation from renewable resources of 20.0 percent of electric retail sales.
Renewable energy as a percentage of PSCo’ total energy:

 | 2017 | | 2016
Renewable | 27.7 | % | | 28.3 | %
Wind | 23.7 | | | 23.7 | 
Hydroelectric, biomass and solar | 3.9 | | | 4.6 | 

PSCo also offers customer-focused renewable energy initiatives. Windsource® allows customers to purchase electricity from renewable sources. The number of customers utilizing Windsource increased to approximately 50,000 in 2017 from 46,000 in 2016. 
Additionally, to encourage the growth of solar energy on the system, customers are offered incentives to install solar panels on their homes and businesses under the Solar*Rewards® program. Over 34,900 PV systems with approximately 310 MW of aggregate capacity have been installed in Colorado as of Dec. 31, 2017 and over 32,500 PV systems with approximately 276 MW of aggregate capacity were installed as of Dec. 31, 2016. Additionally, 33 community solar gardens with 33.5 MW of capacity have been completed in Colorado as of Dec. 31, 2017. 
Wind — PSCo acquires the majority of its wind energy from PPAs. Currently, PSCo has 18 of these agreements in place, with facilities ranging in size from two MW to over 300 MW.

• | PSCo had approximately 2,560 MW of wind energy on its system at the end of 2017 and 2016. In addition to receiving purchased wind energy under these agreements, PSCo typically receives wind RECs which are used to meet state renewable resource requirements.


• | The average cost per MWh of wind energy under these contracts was approximately $42 in 2017 and 2016. The cost per MWh of wind energy varies by contract and may be influenced by a number of factors including regulation, state-specific renewable resource requirements, and the year of contract execution. Generally, previously executed contracts continued to benefit from improvements in wind technology, excess capacity among manufacturers, and motivation to commence new construction prior to the anticipated expiration of the federal PTCs. In December 2015, the federal PTCs were extended through 2019 with a phase down on sites that began construction in 2017. 

Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations
PSCo conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging and sharing of any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement. See Item 7 for further discussion.

SPS
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — The PUCT and NMPRC regulate SPS’ retail electric operations and have jurisdiction over its retail rates and services and the construction of transmission or generation in their respective states. The municipalities in which SPS operates in Texas have original jurisdiction over SPS’ rates in those communities. The municipalities’ rate setting decisions are subject to review by the PUCT, which has ultimate authority to set the rates SPS charges in the municipalities. The NMPRC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities. SPS is regulated by the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers, and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. As approved by the FERC, SPS is a transmission-owning member of the SPP RTO and operates within the SPP RTO and SPP IM wholesale market. SPS is authorized to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 
Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — SPS has several retail adjustment clauses that recover fuel, purchased energy and other resource costs:

• | DCRF — Recovers distribution costs in Texas that are not included in base rates.


• | EECRF — Recovers costs associated with providing energy efficiency programs in Texas.


• | EE rider — Recovers costs associated with providing energy efficiency programs in New Mexico.


• | FPPCAC — Adjusts monthly to recover the actual fuel and purchased power costs.


• | PCRF — Allows recovery of certain purchased power costs in Texas that are not included in base rates.


• | RPS — Recovers deferred costs associated with renewable energy programs in New Mexico.


• | TCRF — Recovers certain transmission infrastructure improvement costs and changes in wholesale transmission charges in Texas that are not included in base rates.

Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of SPS’ retail electric tariff. SO2 and NOx allowance revenues and costs are also recovered through the fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor. The regulations allow retail fuel factors to change up to three times per year.
The fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor provides for the over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy expenses. Regulations also require refunding or surcharging over- or under- recovery amounts, including interest, when they exceed four percent of the utility’s annual fuel and purchased energy costs on a rolling 12-month basis, if this condition is expected to continue.
PUCT regulations require periodic examination of SPS’ fuel and purchased energy costs, the efficient use of fuel and purchased energy, fuel acquisition and management policies and purchased energy commitments. SPS is required to file an application for the PUCT to retrospectively review fuel and purchased energy costs at least every three years. In June 2016, SPS filed its fuel reconciliation application which reconciled fuel and purchased power costs for 2013 through 2015. In March 2017, the PUCT approved the application.
SPS recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale customers through a monthly wholesale fuel and purchased economic energy cost adjustment clause accepted for filing by the FERC.
Capacity and Demand
Uninterrupted system peak demand for SPS for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2018, assuming normal weather conditions, is as follows:

 | System Peak Demand (in MW)
 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2018 Forecast
SPS | 4,374 | | 4,836 | | 4,678 | 4,483

22

The peak demand for the SPS system typically occurs in the summer. The 2017 system peak demand for SPS occurred on July 26, 2017. The decline in peak load from 2016 to 2017 is in part due to cooler weather in 2017. Additionally, the partial requirement contract with Golden Spread ended May 2017, contributing to the lower actual peak demand for SPS. The 2018 forecast assumes normal peak day weather.
Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives
SPS expects to use existing electric generating stations, power purchases, DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements. In addition, SPS has evaluated water supply issues at its Tolk facility, concluding that additional resource investment will be required to operate the plant through its existing life. The Ogallala aquifer in this region of the country has depleted more rapidly than expected and SPS installed a horizontal water well that could help to delay the need for a more substantial investment solution. As a result of this issue and to a lesser extent, future environmental rules facing the plant, SPS is seeking a decrease to the remaining life of the facility in its current Texas and New Mexico rate case proceedings (see Note 12).
Purchased Power — SPS has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts typically require a periodic capacity charge and an energy charge for energy actually purchased. SPS also makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, to replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance or during outages, to meet operating reserve obligations or to obtain energy at a lower cost.
Purchased Transmission Services — SPS has contractual arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.
TUCO Substation to Yoakum County Substation to Hobbs Plant Substation 345 KV Transmission Line — In 2014, SPP evaluated anticipated transmission needs for certain parts of the SPP region which is commonly known as the High Priority Incremental Load Study. As a result, SPS received 44 transmission projects, with an original estimated cost of $557 million. The most significant of these projects are the TUCO Substation to the Yoakum County Substation to the Hobbs Plant Substation and the Hobbs Plant Substation to the China Draw Substation transmission line projects. 
In 2016 and 2017, SPS received CCNs for the three segments of the TUCO Substation to Yoakum County Substation to Hobbs Plant Substation 345 KV transmission line, which are expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2020. This 345 KV transmission line is part of a larger project which includes an additional 345 KV transmission line from the Hobbs Plant Substation to the China Draw Substation, which was approved by the NMPRC in 2016 and is anticipated to be in service by June 2018. The estimated total investment for these transmission lines is approximately $402 million.  
Wind Proposals — In March 2017, SPS filed proposals with the NMPRC and the PUCT to build, own and operate 1,000 MW of new wind generation through two wind farms for a cost of approximately $1.6 billion. In addition, the proposal includes a PPA for 230 MW of wind.
In December 2017, SPS and parties filed a unanimous stipulation with the NMPRC. The stipulation is subject to approval by the NMPRC. The key terms of the stipulation are listed below:

• | An investment cap of $1,675 per KW, which is equal to 102.5 percent of the estimated construction costs;


• | SPS customers would receive a credit to their bills if actual capacity factors fall below 48 percent;


• | SPS customers would receive 100 percent of the federal PTC; and


• | SPS can file a HTY rate case and include projected capital additions for the wind farms five months beyond the end of the test year. Interim rates would also be made effective 30 days after filing which will allow SPS to closely match the start of cost recovery for that wind farm with the in service date.

On Feb. 9, 2018, the Hearing Examiner issued a certification of stipulation (certification) recommending approval of all but one aspect of the stipulation, which is the provision for interim rate recovery of SPS’ investment in the two wind farms. On Feb. 19, 2018, SPS filed exceptions to the recommended decision, as did other parties to the stipulation.
In addition, SPS has reached a settlement in principle with parties in Texas and is working towards finalizing a stipulation. SPS has shared an updated analysis with all parties which shows the wind projects remain cost-effective following the passage of the TCJA. The settlements require approval by the NMPRC and PUCT. Both commissions are expected to rule on the settlements by the end of the first quarter of 2018. The Hale wind project in Texas and the Sagamore wind project in New Mexico are scheduled to be in service by mid-2019 and year-end 2020, respectively.

Lubbock Power & Light’s (LP&L’s) Request for Participation in ERCOT — In September 2017, LP&L filed its application with the PUCT and proposed to transition a portion of its load to ERCOT no later than June 2021. As a result of LP&L’s proposal, approximately $18 million in wholesale transmission revenue would be reallocated to remaining SPS transmission customers at the time of the load transition. In November 2017, SPS and various other parties, including the PUCT Staff, filed direct testimony in response to LP&L’s application. SPS proposed an Interconnection Switching Fee to be determined by the PUCT.
In February 2018, SPS, LP&L, the PUCT Staff and various other parties filed a stipulation that provides SPS’ customers with an Interconnection Switching Fee of approximately $24 million to compensate them for the transfer of LP&L’s load from SPP to ERCOT. Under the settlement, SPS would allocate the Interconnection Switching Fee to its Texas and New Mexico retail and wholesale transmission customers through a bill credit following LP&L’s load transition to ERCOT (tentatively, June 2021). A PUCT decision is expected in March 2018. No final decision regarding LP&L’s departure or its potential timing is expected until completion of the PUCT proceedings.
Texas State ROFR Request for Declaratory Order — In February 2017, SPS and SPP filed a joint petition with the PUCT for a declaratory order regarding SPS’ ROFR. SPS contended that Texas law grants an incumbent electric utility, operating in areas outside of ERCOT, the ROFR to construct new transmission facilities located in the utility’s service area. SPP stated that Texas law does not provide a clear statement regarding the ROFR for incumbent utilities and therefore SPP was abiding by the portion of its OATT, which requires competitive solicitation to construct and operate new transmission facilities within areas of Texas’ SPP footprint. 
In October 2017, the PUCT issued an order finding that SPS does not possess an exclusive right to construct and operate transmission facilities within its service area. In January 2018, SPS and two other parties filed appeals of the PUCT’s order in the Texas State District Court. The appeals have been consolidated. A schedule has not been set for the case.

Fuel Sources
Coal — SPS purchases all of the coal requirements for its two coal facilities, Harrington and Tolk electric generating stations, from TUCO. TUCO arranges for the purchase, receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing and delivery of coal to meet SPS’ requirements. TUCO is responsible for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers. The coal supply contract with TUCO expires on Dec. 31, 2022 for both Harrington and Tolk. 
SPS normally maintains approximately 35 - 50 days of coal inventory. As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, coal inventories at SPS were approximately 52 and 64 day supply, respectively. Milder weather, purchase commitments and relatively low power and natural gas prices resulted in coal inventories being above optimal levels. SPS’ generation stations primarily use low-sulfur western coal from mines operating in Wyoming. TUCO has coal agreements to supply 79 percent of SPS’ estimated coal requirements in 2018 and a declining percentage of requirements in subsequent years. SPS’ general coal purchasing objective is to contract for approximately 75 percent of requirements for the first year, 40 percent of requirements in year two and 20 percent of requirements in year three.
Natural gas — SPS uses both firm and interruptible natural gas supply in combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas for SPS’ power plants is procured under contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel, which typically is purchased with terms of one year or less. The transportation and storage contracts expire between 2018 to 2033. All of the natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing that is tied to various natural gas indices.
Most transportation contract pricing is based on FERC and Railroad Commission of Texas approved transportation tariff rates. Certain natural gas supply and transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. SPS’ commitments related to gas supply contracts were approximately $11 million and $17 million and commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts were approximately $191 million and $161 million at Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
SPS has limited on-site fuel oil storage facilities and primarily relies on the spot market for incremental supplies.
Renewable Energy Sources
SPS’ renewable energy portfolio includes wind and solar power from PPAs. As of Dec. 31, 2017, SPS is in compliance with mandated RPS, which require generation from renewable resources of 3.7 percent of Texas electric retail sales and 15.0 percent of New Mexico electric retail sales. 
Renewable energy as a percentage of SPS’ total energy:

 | 2017 | | 2016
Renewable | 24.0 | % | | 22.8 | %
Wind | 21.2 | | | 21.6 | 
Solar | 1.8 | | | 1.2 | 

SPS also offers customer-focused renewable energy initiatives. Windsource® allows customers in New Mexico to purchase electricity from renewable sources. The number of customers utilizing Windsource increased to approximately 940 in 2017 from 900 in 2016. 
Wind — SPS acquires its wind energy from IPP contracts and QF tariffs. SPS currently has 24 of these agreements in place, with facilities ranging in size from under two MW to 250 MW. 

• | SPS had approximately 1,500 MW of wind energy on its system at the end of 2017 and 2016. In addition to receiving purchased wind energy under these agreements, SPS typically receives wind RECs on certain agreements which are used to meet state renewable resource requirements. 


• | The average cost per MWh of wind energy under the IPP contracts and QF tariffs was approximately $27 for 2017 and $25 for 2016. The cost per MWh of wind energy varies by contract and may be influenced by a number of factors including regulation, state-specific renewable resource requirements and the year of contract execution. Generally, contracts executed in 2017 continued to benefit from improvements in technology, excess capacity among manufacturers, and motivation to commence new construction prior to the anticipated expiration of the federal PTCs. In December 2015, the federal PTCs were extended through 2019 with a phase down on sites that began construction in 2017.

Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations
SPS conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. SPS uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. See Item 7 for further discussion.
Summary of Recent Federal Regulatory Developments
The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale, hydro facility licensing, natural gas transportation, asset transactions and mergers, accounting practices and certain other activities of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries and TransCos, including enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. State and local agencies have jurisdiction over many of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries’ activities, including regulation of retail rates and environmental matters. In addition to the matters discussed below, see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of other regulatory matters.
Xcel Energy attempts to mitigate the risk of regulatory penalties through formal training on prohibited practices and a compliance function that reviews interaction with the markets under FERC and CFTC jurisdictions. Public campaigns are conducted to raise awareness of the public safety issues of interacting with our electric systems. While programs to comply with regulatory requirements are in place, there is no guarantee the compliance programs or other measures will be sufficient to ensure against violations.
FERC Order, ROE Policy — In June 2014, the FERC adopted a two-step ROE methodology for electric utilities in an order issued in a complaint proceeding involving New England Transmission Owners (NETOs). The issue of how to apply the FERC ROE methodology has been contested in various complaint proceedings, including two ROE complaints involving the MISO TOs, which include NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. In April 2017, the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) vacated and remanded the June 2014 ROE order. The D.C. Circuit found that the FERC had not properly determined that the ROE authorized for the NETOs prior to June 2014 was unjust and unreasonable. The D.C. Circuit also found that the FERC failed to justify the new ROE methodology. The FERC has yet to act on the D.C. Circuit’s decision. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the D.C. Circuit’s decision and the impact on the MISO ROE Complaints.
DOE Grid Resiliency Notice of Proposed Rule (NOPR) — In September 2017, the DOE requested the FERC to consider and adopt a Grid Resiliency and Pricing Rule to address threats to the U.S. electrical grid. Under the proposed rule, coal and nuclear generation facilities would have to meet certain criteria to qualify for full recovery of their costs including a fair rate of return. In January 2018, the FERC rejected the DOE’s proposal, but alternatively initiated an inquiry into how RTOs and Independent System Operators address grid resilience. Efforts to resolve U.S. grid resilience issues may result from this proceeding and Xcel Energy plans to monitor and respond as necessary. 
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) Enforcement Complaint against CPUC — In December 2016, Sustainable Power Group, LLC (sPower) petitioned the FERC to initiate an enforcement action in federal court against the CPUC under PURPA. The petition asserts that a December 2016 CPUC ruling, which indicated that a QF must be a successful bidder in a PSCo resource acquisition bidding process, violated PURPA and FERC rules. In January 2017, PSCo filed a motion to intervene and protest, arguing that the FERC should decline the petition. The CPUC filed a similar pleading. sPower has proposed to construct 800 MW of solar generation and 700 MW of wind generation in Colorado and seeks to require PSCo to contract for these resources under PURPA. 
If sPower were to prevail, PSCo’s ability to select generation resources through competitive bidding would be negatively affected. However, due to a lack of quorum at the FERC, the FERC did not act on that petition within the sixty days contemplated by PURPA. 
Subsequently sPower filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (District Court) requesting that the court find the bidding requirement in the CPUC QF rules to be unlawful. PSCo intervened in that proceeding and the CPUC filed a motion to dismiss. In June 2017, the United States Magistrate Judge issued a recommendation to the District Court that sPower’s complaint be dismissed because sPower failed to establish that it faced a substantial risk of harm. In October 2017, the District Court denied the CPUC’s motion to dismiss and instead allowed sPower to file an amended complaint. The case effectively started over and PSCo intervened. The CPUC filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint which is currently pending before the District Court. The timing of a resolution in this case is unclear.

NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS
Overview
Xcel Energy operates natural gas local distribution companies in six states, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Colorado with PSCo being the largest. The most significant developments in the natural gas operations of the utility subsidiaries are uncertainty regarding political and regulatory developments that impact hydraulic fracturing, safety requirements for natural gas pipelines and the continued trend of declining use per residential and small C&I customer, as a result of improved building construction technologies, higher appliance efficiencies and conservation. From 2000 to 2017, average annual sales to the typical residential customer declined 17 percent, while sales to the typical small C&I customer declined 10 percent, each on a weather-normalized basis. Although wholesale price increases do not directly affect earnings because of natural gas cost-recovery mechanisms, high prices can encourage further efficiency efforts by customers. 
The PHMSA
Pipeline Safety Act — The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act (Pipeline Safety Act) requires additional verification of pipeline infrastructure records by pipeline owners and operators to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure of lines located in high consequence areas or more-densely populated areas.  In April 2016, the PHMSA released proposed rules that address this verification requirement along with a number of other significant changes to gas transmission regulations.  These changes include requirements around use of automatic or remote-controlled shut-off valves, testing of certain previously untested transmission lines and expanding integrity management requirements. The Pipeline Safety Act also includes a maximum penalty for violating pipeline safety rules of $2 million per day for related violations.  
PHMSA is currently working through the rule with its Pipeline Advisory Committee. Current estimates are the rule will likely go into effect in late 2018 or early 2019. 

Xcel Energy has been taking actions that were intended to comply with the Pipeline Safety Act and any related PHMSA regulations as they become effective.  PSCo and NSP-Minnesota can generally recover costs to comply with the transmission and distribution integrity management programs through the PSIA and GUIC riders, respectively.
28

NSP-Minnesota
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s retail natural gas operations are regulated by the MPUC and the NDPSC within their respective states. The MPUC has regulatory authority over security issuances, certain property transfers, mergers with other utilities and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s natural gas supply plans for meeting customers’ future energy needs. NSP-Minnesota is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to certain natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. NSP-Minnesota is subject to the DOT, the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety, the NDPSC and the SDPUC for pipeline safety compliance, including pipeline facilities used in electric utility operations for fuel deliveries.
Purchased Gas and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Minnesota’s retail natural gas rates for Minnesota and North Dakota include a PGA clause that provides for prospective monthly rate adjustments to reflect the forecasted cost of purchased natural gas, transportation service and storage service. The annual difference between the natural gas cost revenues collected through PGA rates and the actual natural gas costs is collected or refunded over the subsequent 12-month period. 
NSP-Minnesota also recovers costs associated with transmission and distribution pipeline integrity management programs through its GUIC rider. Costs recoverable under the GUIC rider include funding for pipeline assessments as well as deferred costs from NSP-Minnesota’s existing sewer separation and pipeline integrity management programs. The MPUC and NDPSC have the authority to disallow recovery of certain costs if they find the utility was not prudent in its procurement activities.
Minnesota state law requires utilities to invest 0.5 percent of their state natural gas revenues in CIP. These costs are recovered through customer base rates and an annual cost-recovery mechanism for the CIP expenditures.
Capability and Demand
Natural gas supply requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers with an alternate energy supply). The maximum daily send-out (firm and interruptible) for NSP-Minnesota was 893,062 MMBtu, which occurred on Dec. 26, 2017 and 800,232 MMBtu, which occurred on Jan. 18, 2016.
NSP-Minnesota purchases natural gas from independent suppliers, generally based on market indices that reflect current prices. The natural gas is delivered under transportation agreements with interstate pipelines. These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of 640,489 MMBtu per day. In addition, NSP-Minnesota contracts with providers of underground natural gas storage services. These agreements provide storage for approximately 26 percent of winter natural gas requirements and 29 percent of peak day firm requirements of NSP-Minnesota.
NSP-Minnesota also owns and operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 2.0 Bcf equivalent and three propane-air plants with a storage capacity of 1.3 Bcf equivalent to help meet its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities have production capacity equivalent to 246,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or approximately 30 percent of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline transportation charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on extremely cold winter days.
NSP-Minnesota is required to file for a change in natural gas supply contract levels to meet peak demand, to redistribute demand costs among classes, or to exchange one form of demand for another. In February 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s contract demand levels for the 2016 through 2017 heating season. Demand levels for the 2017 through 2018 heating season were filed with the MPUC in August 2017.
Natural Gas Supply and Costs
NSP-Minnesota actively seeks natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased interruption and financial risk and economical rates. In addition, NSP-Minnesota conducts natural gas price hedging activity that has been approved by the MPUC.

GENERAL
Seasonality
The demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months, and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result, the overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Additionally, Xcel Energy’s operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. See Item 7 for further discussion.
Competition
Xcel Energy is a vertically integrated utility in all of its jurisdictions, subject to traditional cost-of-service regulation by state public utilities commissions. However, Xcel Energy is subject to different public policies that promote competition and the development of energy markets. Xcel Energy’s industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to own or operate facilities to generate their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels, such as natural gas, steam or chilled water for heating, cooling and manufacturing purposes, or the option of relocating their facilities to a lower cost region. Customers also have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and in most jurisdictions can avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them. Several states have policies designed to promote the development of solar and other distributed energy resources through significant incentive policies; with these incentives and federal tax subsidies, distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy’s electric service business.
33

The FERC has continued to promote competitive wholesale markets through open access transmission and other means. As a result, Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries and their wholesale customers can purchase the output from generation resources of competing wholesale suppliers and use the transmission systems of the utility subsidiaries on a comparable basis to serve their native load.
In addition, FERC Order 1000 seeks to establish competition for construction and operation of certain new electric transmission facilities. State public utilities commissions have created resource planning programs that promote competition in the acquisition of electricity generation resources used to provide service to retail customers. Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries also have franchise agreements with certain cities subject to periodic renewal. If a city elected not to renew the franchise agreement, it could seek alternative means for its citizens to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization. While each of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with currently available alternatives.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Xcel Energy’s facilities are regulated by federal and state environmental agencies. These agencies have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous substances. Various company activities require registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals from these agencies. Xcel Energy has received all necessary authorizations for the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and distribution systems. Xcel Energy’s facilities have been designed and constructed to operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards. However, it is not possible to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to environmental regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or what effect future laws or regulations may have upon Xcel Energy’s operations. See Item 7 and Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
There are significant present and future environmental regulations to encourage the use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs to address climate change. Xcel Energy has undertaken a number of initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. If these future environmental regulations do not provide credit for the investments we have already made to reduce GHG emissions, or if they require additional initiatives or emission reductions, then their requirements would potentially impose additional substantial costs. Xcel Energy believes, based on prior state commission practice, it would recover the cost of these initiatives through rates.
Xcel Energy is committed to addressing climate change and potential climate change regulation through efforts to reduce its GHG emissions in a balanced, cost-effective manner. Starting in 2011, Xcel Energy began reporting GHG emissions to the EPA under the EPA’s mandatory GHG Reporting Program.
Xcel Energy estimates that in 2017, it reduced the CO2 emissions associated with the electric generating resources used to serve its customers by 35 percent from 2005 levels. This reduction accounts for emissions both from electric generating plants owned by Xcel Energy as well as purchased power. To achieve this goal, Xcel Energy primarily relied on strategies that resulted in:

• | Development of renewable energy facilities;


• | Retirement and replacement of existing generating plants; and


• | Customer energy efficiency programs.

CAPITAL SPENDING AND FINANCING
See Item 7 for a discussion of expected capital expenditures and funding sources.
EMPLOYEES
As of Dec. 31, 2017, Xcel Energy had 11,075 full-time employees and 59 part-time employees, of which 5,115 were covered under collective-bargaining agreements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
