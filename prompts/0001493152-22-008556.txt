The GO-Global Software Products
 
Our GO-Global product offerings, which currently are our only revenue source, can be categorized into product families as follows:
 

● | GO-Global for Windows: Allows access to Windows-based applications from remote locations and a variety of connections, including the Internet connections. The Windows applications run on a central computer server along with GO-Global Windows Host software. This allows the applications to be accessed remotely via GO-Global Client software, or a Web browser, over many types of data connections, regardless of the bandwidth or operating system. Web-enabling is achieved without modifying the underlying application’s code or requiring costly add-ons.

● | GO-Global for UNIX: Allows access to UNIX and Linux-based applications from remote locations and a variety of connections, including the Internet and connections. The UNIX/Linux applications run on a central computer server along with the GO-Global for UNIX Host software. This allows the applications to be accessed and run remotely via GO-Global Client software or a Web browser without having to modify the application’s code or requiring costly add-ons. 
● | GO-Global Client: We offer a range of GO-Global Client software that allows remote application access from a wide variety of local, remote and mobile platforms, including Windows, Linux, UNIX, Apple OS X and iOS, and Google Android. We plan to continue to develop GO-Global Client software for new portable and mobile devices. 

Target Markets
 
The target market for our GO-Global products includes small to medium-sized companies, departments within large corporations, governmental and educational institutions and independent software vendors (ISVs). Our software enables these targeted organizations to move their existing applications to the public cloud and provide SaaS, or move them to a secure, private cloud environment. By using our software, organizations can give their remote users, partners and customers access to their native applications. Our software is designed to allow these organizations and enterprises to tailor the configuration of the end-user device for a particular purpose, rather than following a “one PC fits all” high-cost ownership model. We believe our opportunities are as follows:

● | ISVs. By Web-enabling their applications through use of our products, we believe that our ISV customers can accelerate their time to market without the risks and delays associated with rewriting applications or using other third-party software, thereby opening up additional revenue opportunities and securing greater satisfaction and loyalty from their customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Our technology integrates with their existing software applications without sacrificing the full-featured look and feel of such applications, thereby providing ISVs with out-of-the-box Web-enabled applications with their own branding for licensed, volume distribution to their enterprise customers. 
● | Enterprises Employing Windows and Unix/Linux. Enterprises ranging from small to medium-sized companies to departments in large companies use GO-Global software to allow users to access applications from remote locations and from different client devices. We believe that our software products reduce the cost and complexity of connecting PCs to various applications.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our GO-Global products are primarily sold through resellers both domestically and internationally. The resellers consist of OEMs, system integrators, value-added resellers and distributors. The reseller channel acts as a sales force for our GO-Global products by creating awareness and also providing integration and support services for our current and potential customers. We support our existing reseller channel and seek to grow our reseller partners through direct marketing activities that include digital marketing, promotional materials, direct response and maintaining an active Web presence for marketing and sale purposes.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had one reseller that represented more than 27.8% of sales and three resellers that represented 51.5%, 15.0%, and 11.9% of accounts receivable, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had one reseller that represented more than 14.5% of sales and one reseller that represented 44.7% of accounts receivable. For the purposes of this description, “sales” refers to the dollar value of orders received from these customers and partners in the period indicated. The sales values do not necessarily equal recognized revenue for these periods due to our revenue recognition policies which require deferral of revenue associated with prepaid software service fees.
 
Operations
 
We perform all purchasing, order processing and shipping of products and accounting functions related to our operations. We generally ship products and fulfill orders electronically so we do not maintain any prepackaged inventory. Additionally, we have relatively little backlog at any given time; thus, we do not consider backlog a significant indicator of future performance.

Competition
 
The software markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Competitive factors in our market space include price, product quality, functionality, product differentiation and the breadth and variety of product offerings and product features. We believe that our products offer certain advantages over our competitors, particularly in product performance and market positioning.
 
GO-Global competes with developers of conventional server-based software for the individual PC, as well as with other companies in the cloud computing software market and the application virtualization software market. We believe our principal competitors in the cloud computing software market include Citrix Systems, Inc., OpenText Communications, Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation. Citrix is an established leading vendor of virtualization software, OpenText is an established market leader for remote access to UNIX applications and Microsoft is an established leading vendor of Windows operating systems and services for servers.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we had a full-time equivalent of 12.5 total employees, including 2 in marketing, sales and support, 8.5 in research and development (which is inclusive of employees who may also perform customer service related activities), 2 in administration and finance. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
