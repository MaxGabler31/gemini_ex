Future Plan
 
Marketing Campaign and Publicity Enhancement

Human Resources and Talent Development
 
Taking into consideration of the aforementioned development, the company is well aware that with existing manpower is far from sufficient to the materialization of future plan, thus spending on human resources and talent development is inevitable, including but not limited to internal admin and operation, sales and marketing, accounting and finance as well as top management. Besides, we would like to invest in the pet supplement innovation and development and explore new business opportunities in the growing pet supplement industry.
Merger and Acquisition
 
The Company is actively seeking opportunity to merge and acquire potential target company to derive extraordinary synergies in multiple segments but limited to healthcare, bio-technology, beauty slimming and wellness, food science and related industries. The management believe that organic growth itself is incapable of coping with the expectation of shareholders in the current dynamic business environment, thus via merger and acquisition the Company can create greater value to every stakeholder not limited to shareholders.
Marketing 
 
We recognise the growing trend of social media and because of that, the management had decided to place a higher priority on social media for our marketing strategy. Coupled with the extensive networks we had built since our inception, the nature of our job has become easier and efficient to reach out to our clients. But, perhaps the most imperative to our success is the ability to connect with our customers and receive their feedback directly. From the feedback we received, we can understand our customer’s demands better and make further improvements. As a result, our customers’ base has been growing exponentially and resulted in a robust brand image of our company.
