Item 1. Business
On February 22, 2019, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc., or Roche. Pursuant to the merger agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, a wholly owned acquisition subsidiary of Roche, or Merger Sub, will commence a cash tender offer, or the tender offer, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at a price per share of $114.50, net to the seller of such shares in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. The completion of the tender offer will be conditioned on at least a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock having been validly tendered into and not withdrawn from the offer, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. 
Following the completion of the tender offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company, with our company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche. The merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, with no stockholder vote required to consummate the merger. In the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares of common stock held by us as treasury stock, or owned by Roche or Merger Sub or held by stockholders who are entitled to demand, and who properly demand, appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $114.50 per share in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. 
We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2019. If the transaction is completed, it is expected that our common stock will be removed from listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market and from registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the transaction.
Overview
We are a leader in the field of gene therapy, seeking to transform the lives of patients suffering from debilitating genetic diseases by developing potentially one-time, life-altering treatments. The goal of gene therapy is to overcome the effects of a malfunctioning, disease-causing gene. Gene therapies have the potential to provide long-lasting effects, dramatically and positively changing the lives of patients with conditions where no, or only palliative, therapies exist. We have built a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates that are directed to the retina, the liver and the central nervous system. 
In December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved LUXTURNATM (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) for the treatment of patients with viable retinal cells and confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, a genetic blinding condition caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. LUXTURNA is the first FDA-approved gene therapy for a genetic disease, the first and only pharmacological treatment for an inherited retinal disease, or IRD, and the first adeno-associated virus, or AAV, vector gene therapy approved in the United States. LUXTURNA is manufactured at our manufacturing facility located in Philadelphia, which is the first licensed manufacturing facility in the United States for a gene therapy treating an inherited disease. LUXTURNA has received orphan drug status. In January 2018, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of voretigene neparvovec outside the United States. In November 2018, we received approval from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the marketing authorization of LUXTURNA in all 28 member states of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
We are supporting the appropriate use of LUXTURNA in the United States through small, targeted commercial and medical affairs teams. LUXTURNA is administered by trained retinal surgeons at selected treatment centers in the United States that specialize in treating IRDs. In January 2018, we announced two novel payer programs to help ensure eligible patients in the United States have access to LUXTURNA: (i) an innovative contracting model that includes an option for direct-to-payer contracting; and (ii) an outcomes-based rebate arrangement with a short-term efficacy measure and a long-term durability measure. 
We have three gene therapy product candidates, to which we retain global commercialization rights, in clinical development: (i) SPK-8011, our lead product candidate in the SPK-FVIII program for hemophilia A; (ii) SPK-8016, a product candidate for the hemophilia A inhibitor market; and (iii) SPK-7001, targeting choroideremia, or CHM. A fourth clinical-stage product candidate, SPK-9001, our lead product candidate in the SPK-FIX program for hemophilia B, recently was transitioned 
to Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, pursuant to our license agreement with Pfizer. In July 2018, Pfizer announced the initiation of a Phase 3 program for SPK-9001, now referred to as PF-06838435 or fidanacogene elaparvovec.
In our SPK-FVIII program for the treatment of hemophilia A, we initiated a dose-escalating Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our lead product candidate, SPK-8011, in 2017. As of a November 2, 2018, data cutoff date, we had enrolled 12 participants in the trial: two at a dose of 5 x 10 vector genomes (vg)/kilogram (kg) of body weight, three at a dose of 1 x 10 vg/kg and seven at a dose of 2 x 1012 vg/kg. Across all 12 participants at the three doses tested, we saw a 94% reduction in bleeding and a 95% reduction in infusions. In the 2 x 1012 vg/kg dose cohort, five of the seven participants had reduced their overall bleeds and infusions by 100% and 99% , respectively (calculated based on data after week four). We also saw evidence of stable, durable factor VIII activity levels in all participants that have been followed for greater than one year. We demonstrated a dose response, with higher doses, on average, leading to higher factor VIII levels. No participant developed factor VIII inhibitors, no thromboembolic events have been reported and transaminase elevations were infrequent and transient. One participant was electively admitted to the hospital to receive intravenous administration of methylprednisolone rather than having the infusions on an outpatient basis. The admission met the criteria for a serious adverse event, or SAEs. We plan to incorporate a course of prophlactic steriods going forward in the development program. 
We have scaled our mammalian cell-based suspension process to a 400 liter process and have achieved initial yields that are supportive of our future clinical and commercial requirements. Analytical and non-clinical testing demonstrated comparability of material manufactured with this suspension process to material manufactured with our adherent process. We have secured dedicated manufacturing capacity at Brammer Bio MA LLC's, or Brammer Bio's, facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
We recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical program for SPK-8011, beginning with a run-in study. In February 2018, FDA granted SPK-8011 breakthrough therapy designation. We retain global commercialization rights to the SPK-FVIII program.
We have additional product candidates in the SPK-FVIII program that are intended to target specific sub-populations of hemophilia A patients, the first of which will target the hemophilia A inhibitor market using a novel, internally developed product candidate, SPK-8016.  Our Investigational New Drug, or IND, for SPK-8016 has been cleared and, per agreement with FDA, we initiated dosing in this Phase 1/2 study in a cohort similar to the patient cohort in our on-going SPK-8011 Phase 1/2 study in order to establish safety before expanding into participants representing segments of the inhibitor market.
In December 2014, we entered into a global collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of SPK-FIX product candidates for the treatment of hemophilia B. In July 2016, FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to SPK-9001, the lead product candidate in our SPK-FIX program. In July 2018, we transitioned the program to Pfizer for Phase 3 development.
We are developing other liver-directed gene therapies, including SPK-3006, our lead product candidate for Pompe disease, an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency that leads to accumulation of glycogen in cells, for which there are shortcomings in current enzyme replacement standard of care. In October 2018, we reported preclinical proof-of-concept data for SPK-3006. 
SPK-7001 is our lead product candidate for the treatment of CHM, an IRD caused by mutations in the REP-1 gene. We have completed enrollment of ten participants in two dose cohorts of our Phase 1/2 trial for SPK-7001 and continue to follow subjects in the trial. In July 2017, we completed enrollment of five additional subjects in the trial who are at an earlier stage of disease. To date, SPK-7001 has been well tolerated and we have not observed any product candidate-related SAEs in this trial. We have observed two SAEs that were deemed to be procedure related. We have received orphan product designation for SPK-7001 for the treatment of CHM in both the United States and the European Union. 
We have several product candidates in various stages of preclinical development. We have preclinical programs targeting IRDs, including Stargardt's disease. We are developing neurodegenerative disease product candidates that are intended to address TPP1 deficiency, which is a form of Batten disease, and Huntington's disease, among others. We have received orphan product designation in the United States for SPK-TPP1 for the treatment of CLN2 disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL)) caused by TPP1 deficiency.
Our product candidates 
The following table summarizes information regarding our product candidates and development programs:
(1) Initial construct licensed from Genethon
(2) Form of Batten disease
Retina-directed gene therapies 
Biallelic IRD due to RPE65 mutations 
Background
Mutations in the RPE65 gene lead to IRD characterized by a range of visual impairments, notably night blindness, or nyctalopia. The RPE65 gene encodes a protein that helps convert the light entering the eye into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, enabling sight. Without the properly functioning protein encoded by the RPE65 gene, the visual cycle is disrupted, resulting in debilitating visual impairments, progressing to blindness. The RPE65 gene is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, layer of the retina. 
RPE65-mediated IRD
RPE65-mediated IRD historically has been clinically diagnosed based on clinical presentation and findings and has been characterized most frequently as a form of Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, or retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, among over 20 other clinical classifications. We estimate that LCA affects approximately one in every 81,000 individuals and RP affects approximately one in every 4,500 individuals. Because, prior to the approval of LUXTURNA, there were no pharmacologic treatments for IRDs and there are known to be over 220 different genes causing IRDs, there are limited epidemiology data from which to derive population estimates.  Additionally, epidemiology estimates vary based on geography. We are aware of studies that estimate the prevalence of RPE65 mutations within the LCA population from approximately 6% to 16% and within the RP population from approximately 1% to 3%. Based on our own assessment of the epidemiology data, we believe the prevalent population is up to approximately 6,000 individuals with RPE65 mutations in the United States, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific. We estimate the United States prevalent population at approximately 1,000 to 2,000 individuals.
LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec) 
In December 2017, FDA approved LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy and viable retinal cells. LUXTURNA is the first FDA-approved gene therapy for a genetic disease, the first and only pharmacological treatment for an IRD and the first AAV vector gene therapy approved in the United States. LUXTURNA is manufactured at our manufacturing facility located in Philadelphia, which is the first licensed manufacturing facility in the United States for a gene therapy treating an inherited disease. LUXTURNA has received orphan drug status. In January 2018, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with Novartis for the development and commercialization of voretigene neparvovec outside the United States. In November 2018, we received approval from the EMA for the marketing authorization of LUXTURNA in all 28-member states of the EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
In October 2015, we announced positive top-line results from our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of LUXTURNA, the first successfully completed randomized controlled Phase 3 trial of a gene therapy for genetic disease in the United States. The Phase 3 trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of functional vision in subjects that were progressing toward complete blindness. 
LUXTURNA continues to demonstrate durable effects as measured by both the multi-luminance mobility test, or MLMT, and full-field light sensitivity threshold testing, or FST. 
We are supporting the appropriate use of LUXTURNA in the United States through small, targeted commercial and medical affairs teams to continue to build and promote access to the product. LUXTURNA is administered by trained retinal surgeons at selected treatment centers in the United States that specialize in treating IRDs. 
In January 2018, we announced two novel payer programs to help ensure eligible patients in the United States have access to LUXTURNA: (i) an innovative contracting model that includes an option for direct-to-payer contracting; and (ii) an outcomes-based rebate arrangement with a short-term efficacy measure and a long-term durability measure. Traditionally, specialty medications administered by physicians in hospitals in the United States are purchased by the institution where the patient is treated. The institution then bills the payer, typically including a mark-up on the product. With higher-value, higher-cost therapies, this traditional “buy and bill” model may represent a significant financial burden and risk to the institution and may create substantial additional costs to the payer. Under our innovative contracting model, we enter into an agreement with the commercial payer under which the payer, or a designated specialty pharmacy, purchases LUXTURNA. As a part of this agreement, the payer agrees to provide coverage for its members consistent with FDA labeling of LUXTURNA, expedite benefits processing and cap patient out-of-pocket amounts at in-network limits. Further, we will share risk with certain health insurers by paying rebates if patient outcomes fail to meet specified thresholds, thereby linking the payment for LUXTURNA to both short-term efficacy (30-90 days) and longer-term durability (30 months) measures that are unique to this one-time gene therapy. The short-term and long-term measures will be based on FST testing scores, with a baseline to be established for each eligible patient before administration of LUXTURNA.
We have established Spark Therapeutics Generation Patient ServicesSM to support commercially insured patients and their caregivers in the United States through the treatment experience. Through this program, we will assist eligible and enrolled commercially insured patients in navigating the insurance process, and will provide options to support their travel and accommodation logistics and costs to and from treatment centers, as well as assistance with other out-of-pocket costs directly related to the treatment.
SPK-7001 for the treatment of choroideremia
Overview
Choroideremia is an IRD linked to the X-chromosome. Clinically, CHM manifests in affected males in childhood as night blindness and a reduction of visual field, followed by progressive constriction of visual fields. CHM is characterized by deletions or mutations in the CHM gene, resulting in defective or absent Rab escort protein-1, which is the encoded protein of the CHM gene. We estimate prevalence of CHM is between approximately one in 50,000 and one in 100,000 people, implying a total population of up to approximately 12,500 males in the United States and the five major European markets.
SPK-7001
Our SPK-CHM program is technically similar to our LUXTURNA program, including use of the same vector, targeting the same types of RPE cells and utilizing the same route of administration through sub-retinal injection. SPK-7001 is our investigational product candidate for the treatment of IRD caused by CHM gene mutations. We have received orphan product designation for SPK-7001 in both the United States and the European Union.
Phase 1/2 clinical trial
We have completed enrollment of ten participants in two dose cohorts of our Phase 1/2 trial for SPK-7001 and continue to follow subjects in the trial. In July 2017, we completed enrollment of five additional subjects in the trial who are at an earlier stage of disease. To date, SPK-7001 has been well tolerated and we have not observed any product candidate-related SAEs in this trial. We have observed two SAEs that were deemed to be procedure related. We are evaluating efficacy primarily by assessing functional vision, as measured by standard ophthalmic tests. Evaluations are ongoing.
Other IRDs
The RPE65 and CHM genes are two of more than 220 genes that have been identified to cause IRDs. We have several preclinical programs targeting other IRDs, including a preclinical program addressing Stargardt's disease, an IRD that affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States.
Liver-directed gene therapies
Our product development portfolio includes product candidates targeting expression of genes in the liver, with a focus on hemophilia and lysosomal storage disorders.
Hemophilia B
Background
Hemophilia B is a serious and rare inherited disease characterized by insufficient blood clotting that results from the lack of functional FIX, a blood clotting factor normally produced by cells located in the liver. Hemophilia B is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the coagulation FIX protein. The condition can lead to repeated and sometimes life-threatening episodes of spontaneous bleeding. According to the 2016 World Federation of Hemophilia Annual Global Survey, approximately 30,000 people worldwide suffer from hemophilia B.
The severity of hemophilia B is determined by the circulating levels of FIX. Severe hemophilia B is classified as a level of FIX in the blood of less than 1% of normal. People with severe hemophilia B experience frequent spontaneous bleeding episodes, often into their joints and muscles. Moderate hemophilia B is classified as a level of FIX in the blood equal to or greater than 1% of normal but less than 5% of normal. People with moderate hemophilia B may have bleeds following trauma, or may have spontaneous bleeding episodes, but these will occur less frequently than in those with severe hemophilia B. 
The current standard of care for hemophilia B is either prophylactic or on-demand FIX protein replacement therapy, in which frequent intravenous administrations of recombinant FIX are required to stop or prevent bleeding. Prophylactic therapy for hemophilia B, which has been shown to lead to the best outcomes, is practiced only by some adult patients in the United States due to the significant expense, patient inconvenience and concern about lifetime insurance caps. A gene therapy treatment could offer patients the benefits of prophylaxis without the need for frequent factor infusion.
SPK-9001, our lead SPK-FIX product candidate for the treatment of hemophilia B
In December 2014, we entered into a global collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of product candidates in our SPK-FIX program for the treatment of hemophilia B. Under this collaboration, we had responsibility for the clinical development of SPK-FIX product candidates through the completion of Phase 1/2 trials. Pfizer has responsibility for further clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercialization. Based on positive Phase 1/2 study results, in July 2018 we transitioned the program to Pfizer. In July 2018, Pfizer announced the initiation of a Phase 3 program.
Hemophilia A
Background
Hemophilia A is a serious and rare inherited disease characterized by insufficient blood clotting that results from the lack of functional factor VIII, a blood clotting factor normally produced by cells located in the liver. Hemophilia A is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the coagulation factor VIII protein. The condition can lead to repeated and sometimes life-threatening episodes of spontaneous bleeding. According to the 2016 World Federation of Hemophilia Annual Global Survey, approximately 150,000 people worldwide suffer from hemophilia A.
The severity of hemophilia A is determined by the circulating levels of factor VIII. Severe hemophilia A is classified as a level of factor VIII in the blood of less than 1% of normal. People with severe hemophilia A experience frequent spontaneous bleeding episodes, often into their joints and muscles. Moderate hemophilia A is classified as a level of factor VIII in the blood 
equal to or greater than 1% of normal but less than 5% of normal. People with moderate hemophilia A may have bleeds following trauma, or may have spontaneous bleeding episodes, but these will occur less frequently than in those with severe hemophilia A. 
The current standard of care for hemophilia A is either prophylactic or on-demand factor VIII protein replacement therapy, in which frequent intravenous administrations of recombinant factor VIII are required to stop or prevent bleeding. Prophylactic therapy for hemophilia A, which has been shown to lead to the best outcomes, is practiced only by some adult patients in the United States due to the significant expense, patient inconvenience and concern about lifetime insurance caps. A gene therapy treatment could offer patients the benefits of prophylaxis without the need for frequent factor infusion.
The most significant complication of treatment with FVIII concentrates in patients with hemophilia A is the development of alloantibodies, or inhibitors, that block factor VIII activity. Approximately 30% of hemophilia A patients develop inhibitors to recombinant or plasma-derived factor VIII. Children, people with a family history of inhibitors and certain ethnic subgroups are more at risk for developing inhibitors, but it has not been possible to predict in advance which patients will be affected. Inhibitors usually appear in young children, within the first 50 exposure days to FVIII replacement therapy, but they can develop at any age. 
Severe hemophilia patients with inhibitors do not bleed more often than other severe patients, but their bleeds are more difficult to manage because they do not respond to standard treatment. Inhibitor patients also may develop serious complications like uncontrollable bleeds and joint disease. Patients with inhibitors are hospitalized more frequently.
Once factor replacement is ineffective due to inhibitors, acute management of bleeding requires agents that bypass factor VIII activity. Long-term management traditionally has consisted of eradicating inhibitors through immune tolerance. Immune tolerance induction, or ITI, can be achieved in approximately 70% of patients that receive regular infusions of factor VIII, which are given several times per week over periods ranging up to 18 months. These frequent infusions may require the placement of an indwelling line, particularly in younger children. Despite the development of multiple ITI protocols over the past forty years, the mechanism of tolerance induction and the best means of achieving it are unknown. Given the arduous nature of all ITI protocols, the time commitment required from families to implement it and the substantial failure rate, some have advocated abandoning this approach and managing inhibitor patients solely with newer, long-acting bypassing agents. Others note that eradication of the inhibitor leads to better overall outcomes and should still be pursued. 
SPK-8011, our lead SPK-FVIII product candidate for the treatment of hemophilia A
We initiated a dose-escalating Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our lead product candidate, SPK-8011, in 2017. In February 2018, FDA granted breakthrough designation to SPK-8011. We recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical program for SPK-8011, beginning with a run-in study. We retain global commercialization rights to the SPK-FVIII program. 
As of a November 2, 2018, data cutoff date, we had enrolled 12 participants in the trial - two at a dose of 5 x 10 vg/kg of body weight, three at a dose of 1 x 10 vg/kg and seven at a dose of 2 x 1012 vg/kg. Across all 12 participants at the three doses tested, we saw a 94% reduction in bleeding and a 95% reduction in infusions. In the 2 x 1012 vg/kg dose cohort, five of the seven participants had reduced their overall bleeds and infusions by 100% and 99% , respectively (calculated based on data after week four). We also saw evidence of stable, durable factor VIII activity levels in all participants that have been followed for greater than one year. We demonstrated a dose response, with higher doses, on average, leading to higher factor VIII levels. No participant developed factor VIII inhibitors, no thromboembolic events have been reported and transaminase elevations were infrequent and transient. One participant was electively admitted to the hospital to receive intravenous administration of methylprednisolone rather than having the infusions on an outpatient basis. This admission met the criteria for an SAE. We plan to incorporate a course of prophylactic steroids going forward in the development program.
Across the study, seven of the 12 participants received a tapering course of oral steroids in response to an alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, elevation above participant baseline, declining factor VIII levels and/or positive IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospots, or ELISPOTs. For these seven participants, steroids led to a normalization of ALT levels and ELISPOTs. For all but two participants in the 2 x 1012 vg/kg dose cohort, oral steroids led to a stabilization of factor VIII levels. One of these two participants did not rapidly respond to oral steroids and was electively admitted to the hospital to receive two intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone rather than having the infusions on an outpatient basis. The event subsequently resolved, but the admission to the hospital met the criteria for an SAE. We plan to incorporate a course of prophylactic steroids going forward in the development program.
We have scaled our mammalian cell-based suspension process to a 400 liter process and have achieved initial yields that are supportive of our future clinical and commercial requirements. Analytical and non-clinical testing demonstrated the comparability of material manufactured with this suspension process to material manufactured with our adherent process. We have secured dedicated manufacturing capacity at Brammer Bio's facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
SPK-8016 for the treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors
We have additional product candidates in the SPK-FVIII program that are intended to target specific sub-populations of hemophilia A patients, the first of which will be aimed at addressing the hemophilia A inhibitor market using a novel, internally developed product candidate, SPK-8016.  Our IND for SPK-8016 has been cleared and, per agreement with FDA, we initiated dosing this Phase 1/2 trial in a cohort similar to our on-going SPK-8011 Phase 1/2 trial in order to establish safety before expanding into participants representing segments of the inhibitor market.
SPK-3006 for the treatment of Pompe disease
We are developing other liver-directed gene therapies, including SPK-3006, for Pompe disease. Pompe disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency that leads to accumulation of glycogen in cells. Pompe disease is a progressive condition that can lead to muscle weakness making walking, breathing and simple activities difficult. 
In October 2018, we presented preclinical proof of concept data for our lead investigational product candidate, SPK-3006. SPK-3006 is an AAV gene therapy expressing a novel, modified form of GAA (secGAA) engineered for efficient secretion into plasma. Preclinical data demonstrated glycogen clearance throughout the body, including in refractory tissues, with sustained plasma GAA levels and evidence of lysosomal uptake driven by one-time administration.
CNS-directed gene therapies
We are developing neurodegenerative disease product candidates that are intended to address TPP1 deficiency, which is a form of Batten disease, and Huntington's disease, among others. We have received orphan product designation in the United States for SPK-TPP1 for the treatment of CLN2 disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL)) caused by TPP1 deficiency.
TPP1 deficiency is a form of Batten disease that causes severe childhood neurodegenerative disorders that result in motor and mental decline, seizures and visual deficits appearing between ages two and four and that is fatal by ages ten to twelve in a majority of cases. 
Huntington's disease is a hereditary genetic disorder with negative physical, emotional, behavioral and cognitive effects. 
We have other neurodegenerative disease programs in preclinical development.
Our manufacturing platform
Using a chemical method we refer to as transfection, we insert many copies of DNA plasmids encoding the specific therapeutic gene sequence, or transgene, into human embryonic kidney cells that have already been grown to high density. During an incubation period following transfection, each cell produces vectors through biosynthesis using the natural machinery available within the cell. At the end of the incubation period, the newly generated vectors are collected from the cells that have been broken apart or, alternatively, from the cell culture medium.
We have made significant investments in developing optimized manufacturing processes and believe that our processes and methods provide the most comprehensive manufacturing process developed to date for AAV-based vector therapies, including:


• | sufficient scale to support commercial manufacturing requirements for LUXTURNA and many of our product candidates, including those for IRDs;


• | stable manufactured AAV vectors with sufficient longevity so that a small number of initial batches will likely provide adequate commercial supply for multiple years;


• | proprietary AAV vector manufacturing processes and techniques that produce a highly purified product candidate, as evidenced by the approximately 25- to 30-fold reduction in non-infectious vector related impurities as compared to vectors used in many previous clinical trials;


• | approximately 30 assays to accurately characterize our process and the AAV vectors we produce; and


• | a series of high-efficiency purification processes, adapted and customized for multiple different AAV capsids, which allow us to produce higher purity AAV vector solutions, with higher concentrations of active vectors and that are essentially free of empty capsids.

We believe these improvements, and our continued investment in our manufacturing platform, will enable us to develop best-in-class, next-generation gene therapy products. For example, we recently demonstrated proof-of-concept in scaling from 
the current adherent process to a suspension process. This capability will be important in addressing disease indications with a large target population, such as hemophilia A.
In 2017, we received FDA current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, validation of our facility in Philadelphia to produce commercial supply of LUXTURNA. In 2018, we successfully completed EMA inspection of our manufacturing facility in Philadelphia. Our facility in Philadelphia is the first licensed manufacturing facility in the United States for a gene therapy treating an inherited disease and is now licensed in Europe and all mutual recognition countries. 
Intellectual property 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we license rights or with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our licensed patents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. Moreover, we have not sought, and may be unable to obtain, patent protection for certain of our product candidates generally, including SPK-CHM, as well as with respect to certain indications. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
We have licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our product candidates. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, generally is directed to AAV vectors, methods of treatment of clinical indications important for our development programs, transferring genetic material into cells, inhibiting antibody responses to gene therapies, processes to manufacture and purify our AAV- and lentiviral-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product candidates. We are heavily dependent on the patented or proprietary technologies that we license from third parties. We anticipate that we will require additional licenses to third-party intellectual property rights relating to our development programs in the future, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

CNS-directed gene therapies
We exclusively in-licensed a portfolio of approximately 181 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications from UIRF that relate to treatment of a broad array of CNS and neurodegenerative diseases.
Trade secrets
In addition to patents and licenses, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our AAV and lentiviral vector and manufacturing processes and gene therapies are based upon trade secrets and know-how. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of our premises and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Collaboration and license agreements 
Pfizer
In December 2014, we entered into a global collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of SPK-FIX product candidates in our gene therapy program for the treatment of hemophilia B. Under the agreement, we have granted Pfizer an exclusive worldwide license under specified patent rights and know-how relating to any factor IX gene therapy that we develop, manufacture or commercialize prior to December 31, 2024, to develop, manufacture and commercialize such licensed factor IX gene therapy products for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and cure of hemophilia B.    
Under the terms of the agreement, we are primarily responsible for conducting research and development activities through completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials of hemophilia B product candidates. Pfizer and we will share development costs incurred under an agreed product development plan for each product candidate, with our share of development costs under the agreement limited to $10.6 million. Following the completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials, Pfizer will primarily be responsible for development, manufacture, regulatory approval and commercialization, including all costs associated therewith.
During the period through completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials, which we refer to as the collaboration period, the hemophilia B program will be governed by a joint steering committee, or JSC, consisting of representatives of Pfizer and us. The JSC will, among other responsibilities, provide operational and strategic oversight to the activities to be performed under the product development plan, will monitor and assess the progress of collaboration activities and will serve as a forum for the parties to communicate regarding collaboration issues and resolve disputes. During the collaboration period, if the JSC is unable to reach agreement, we generally have final decision-making authority regarding the conduct of the agreed product development plan and, following the collaboration period, Pfizer generally has final decision-making authority regarding the further development and commercialization of licensed compounds and licensed products.
Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $20.0 million upfront payment. In each of December 2015 and December 2016, we earned a $15.0 million milestone payment and also are eligible to receive up to an additional $230.0 million in aggregate milestone payments under the agreement, $110.0 million of which relates to potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the first product candidate to achieve each milestone and $120.0 million of which relates to potential regulatory milestones for additional product candidates. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalties, calculated as a low-teen percentage of net sales of licensed products. The royalties may be subject to certain reductions, including for a specified portion of royalty payments that Pfizer may become required to pay under any third-party license agreements, subject to a minimum royalty. Under the agreement, we remain solely responsible for the payment of license payments payable by us under specified license agreements.
In June 2016, Pfizer and we amended the agreement to allow for the technology transfer of certain of our manufacturing processes related to SPK-9001 to be transferred to Pfizer for use in the field of hemophilia B. 
In November 2017, Pfizer and we amended the agreement to provide for the enrollment of up to five additional participants in the current Phase 1/2 clinical trial each of which will receive SPK-9001 manufactured using an enhanced process to test its comparability to SPK-9001 received by the first 10 participants enrolled in the ongoing trial. Under the terms of this amendment, we received a $10.0 million upfront payment and received an additional $15.0 million in milestone payments. 
The agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the latest of: (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim, as defined in the agreement, in the licensed patent rights covering a licensed product, (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire regulatory exclusivity granted with respect to a licensed product or (iii) 15 years after the first commercial sale of the last licensed product to be launched, in each case in the applicable country. The last to expire patent right licensed to Pfizer, if it issues as a patent, is currently expected to expire in 2034, excluding any applicable patent term extension or adjustment, although we could obtain rights to additional patents, including through the issuance of pending patent applications, with later expiration dates, which would be subject to Pfizer’s license under the agreement. After expiration, but not termination, of the agreement as to a country, Pfizer’s licenses will become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable as to licensed products in the applicable country.
Pfizer may terminate the agreement, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and a country-by-country basis, or in its entirety, for any or no reason (i) upon 90 days’ written notice prior to the commencement of commercialization of a licensed product or (ii) upon 180 days’ written notice after the commencement of commercialization of a licensed product. Either party may, subject to a cure period, terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Either party also may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events. If the agreement is terminated, rights to licensed products that were being developed, manufactured or commercialized at that time generally revert to us.
If the agreement is terminated by Pfizer after the initiation of a pivotal clinical trial, and we continue development utilizing intellectual property rights or data developed by Pfizer through its activities under the agreement, we will be required to pay 
Pfizer a royalty, calculated as a single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed products, with the percentage determined based on the stage of development or commercialization of the product candidate at the time of Pfizer’s termination.
In February 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Pfizer for production of one batch of SPK-9001 drug substance, which was delivered in July 2018. 
In July 2018, Pfizer announced they had initiated a Phase 3 program following the transfer of our responsibility for the hemophilia B gene therapy program to Pfizer.
Novartis
In January 2018, we entered into a Licensing and Commercialization Agreement, or the Novartis License Agreement, with Novartis to develop and commercialize voretigene neparvovec outside the United States. We also entered into a Supply Agreement with Novartis, or the Novartis Supply Agreement, to manufacture and supply all of the requirements of Novartis for voretigene neparvovec. Under the terms of the Novartis License Agreement, we granted Novartis an exclusive right and license, under our intellectual property reasonably necessary or useful for the development or commercialization of LUXTURNA™, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of RPE65-mediated IRD in humans outside the United States. 
Novartis paid us a non-refundable, non-creditable, one-time payment of $105.0 million and $25.0 million for approval of voretigene neparvovec by the EMA in November 2018, and we may receive up to an additional $40.0 million based upon the achievement of certain aggregate net sales in certain markets. We also are entitled to receive royalty payments at a flat mid-twenties percentage of net sales on a royalty-region by royalty-region basis, subject to reduction and extension in certain circumstances. We will retain regulatory responsibility for obtaining approval for LUXTURNA by EMA and Novartis will have regulatory responsibility for obtaining approval for LUXTURNA for countries outside of the United States and the European Union. 
The Novartis License Agreement continues until the last to complete royalty term, which is on a royalty-region by royalty-region basis for 12 years from the first commercial sale in such region of LUXTURNA, but may be extended in a certain country until regulatory exclusivity expires in that country or on a region-by-region basis until aggregate net sales fall below a certain threshold. Either party may terminate the Novartis License Agreement upon the other party’s uncured material breach of the Novartis License Agreement, insolvency, or bankruptcy. Novartis may terminate the Novartis License Agreement at any time upon one year’s prior written notice to us. Novartis also may terminate the Novartis License Agreement in the event: (i) that there is an uncured material breach of the Novartis Supply Agreement by us, resulting in Novartis taking over the manufacture of LUXTURNA or (ii) we undergo a change of control.
Under the Novartis Supply Agreement, we have agreed to provide all of the commercial supply of LUXTURNA required by Novartis, subject to certain conditions. The Novartis Supply Agreement continues until the expiration or early termination of the Novartis License Agreement. Either party also may terminate the Novartis Supply Agreement upon the other party’s uncured material breach of the Novartis Supply Agreement, insolvency or bankruptcy.
In-license agreements
We have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents under licenses from other entities. We consider the commercial terms of these licenses, which provide for modest milestone and royalty payments, and their provisions regarding diligence, insurance, indemnification and other similar matters, to be reasonable and customary for our industry.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
In October 2013, we entered into a technology assignment agreement with CHOP. Under this agreement, CHOP assigned to us CHOP’s rights to the preclinical and clinical programs and intellectual property that we are currently advancing, as well as know-how, standard operating procedures, trade secrets and proprietary processes related to our manufacturing platform. Furthermore, under this agreement, we obtained commercial rights to the drug master file, batch records and related data associated with the manufacture of AAV and lentiviral vectors using our manufacturing platform.
We also entered into a license agreement with CHOP under which CHOP granted us an exclusive worldwide license in the field of gene therapy, with the right to sublicense, under a broad portfolio of gene therapy and viral vector patent rights and gene therapy know-how related to vector manufacturing technology, the treatment of hemophilia and other gene therapy indications. CHOP also granted us a non-exclusive worldwide license in the field of gene therapy, with the right to sublicense, to other know-how owned or controlled by CHOP, existing as of the effective date of the license agreement and not explicitly covered by the exclusive licenses, that is necessary or useful for making, using, selling or importing any products we may develop that are covered by our exclusive license. Under both license grants, we have the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights or the licensed know-how in the field of gene therapy. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable best efforts to develop and 
commercialize licensed products. We are obligated under the license agreement to make milestone payments upon the treatment of the first subject treated in a U.S. Phase 3, or a foreign equivalent, clinical trial and upon the first commercial sale for the first licensed product in each of four indications. These milestone payments range from $125,000 to $5.0 million, and would, in the aggregate, reach a maximum of $7.1 million if all milestones are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to pay CHOP a low-single-digit royalty on a country-by-country basis on net sales of licensed products covered by a valid licensed patent claim. Following the expiration of our royalty obligations as to a licensed product in a country, we will retain a perpetual, full and unrestricted right to make, use and commercialize the licensed product in such country under the licensed intellectual property rights. CHOP controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. We have agreed to reimburse CHOP for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights, including those fees and expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the license agreement. Unless sooner terminated, the term of the license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patent rights, the latest of which is currently expected to expire in 2034. If we oppose or contest the grant or validity of any licensed patent right, or any claims thereof, CHOP may terminate the license granted to us with respect to such patent right. CHOP may terminate this license upon uncured material breaches by us of the terms of the license or if such action is legally necessary to comply with applicable federal laws or regulations relating to government march-in rights and we may terminate the license at any time upon giving 90 days’ prior written notice to CHOP.
We also have entered into a master research services agreement with CHOP under which CHOP supplies us with viral vectors. Under this master research services agreement, we expect to maintain a sufficient supply of clinical-grade gene therapy vectors produced in CHOP’s cGMP clinical facility to meet both our clinical needs and, at our option, our commercial batches to support the commercial launch of LUXTURNA. The term of the agreement extends until October 14, 2028 as to services relating to the supply of RPE65 vectors and until June 30, 2018 as to other services, and continues beyond such expiration dates as to work orders executed by the parties prior to the applicable expiration date until the completion of such work orders. We amended this agreement in March 2016 to extend the expiration date for services other than the supply of LUXTURNA vectors. We may terminate this agreement upon 30 days’ written notice for any reason, and CHOP may terminate this agreement upon 30 days’ written notice upon uncured material breaches by us of the terms of the agreement or if it reasonably determines that continuation of this agreement will have a materially adverse effect on its legal, regulatory or tax status.
We also entered into an additional licensing agreement with CHOP in November 2015. The licensing agreement supplements our existing license agreement with CHOP by granting us a worldwide exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, to use and practice a patent application family related to the production of gene therapies on substantially the same terms and conditions as the existing agreement.
University of Pennsylvania
In December 2015, we converted a co-exclusive license agreement to certain patent rights with Penn, Cornell University and the University of Florida relating to a method of treating and retarding the development of blindness to manufacture and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights in the field of research, development, manufacture and commercialization for the diagnosis, treatment, amelioration and prevention of human and animal diseases to an exclusive license in the field of use related to the treatment of retinal disorders or diseases caused by a mutation or mutations in the RPE65 gene. Penn can no longer grant an additional license to a third party with the same scope of rights that we have received under our amended license agreement with Penn, including a right to commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights. 
Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, and to use such efforts to accomplish specified development and commercial launch objectives in accordance with a specified timeline as well as to expend specified resources in the development and commercialization of licensed products. If our total expenditures on development and commercialization of the licensed products in any 12-month period do not meet or exceed the applicable diligence minimum, then we must pay Penn the amount of the shortfall. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to make commercial milestone payments related to the licensed products, which could, in the aggregate, reach a maximum of $3.8 million per licensed product if all milestones are achieved for such licensed product. In addition, we are obligated to pay Penn a low- to mid-single-digit royalty, on a country-by-country basis, on net sales of licensed products covered by a valid licensed patent claim. Penn controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. We made an initial cash payment to Penn to cover 50% of Penn’s previously incurred patent expenses relating to the licensed patent rights, with the exception of one patent for which we agreed to reimburse Penn for all such expenses. With respect to that specific patent, we agreed to reimburse Penn for patent expenses arising during the term of the license. This license will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of all of the patents and patent applications subject to the license, the latest of which is currently expected to expire in 2022. Penn may terminate the license upon uncured material breaches by us of the terms of the license or upon the occurrence of certain events, including specified bankruptcy and insolvency events relating to us, or if we commence an action against Penn or any of the co-owners of the licensed patent rights 
to declare or render invalid or unenforceable the patent rights. We may terminate the license at any time upon giving 60 days’ prior written notice to Penn.
In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Penn, under which Penn granted us an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to certain patent rights owned by Penn related to certain proviral plasmids that are useful in the manufacture of certain gene therapy products for the treatment of CHM.
Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, and to use such efforts to accomplish development and commercial launch objectives as well as to expend specified resources in the development and commercialization of licensed products. If our total expenditures in any 12-month period do not meet or exceed the applicable diligence minimum, then we must pay Penn the amount of the shortfall. Under the terms of the agreement, we issued shares of our common stock to Penn and we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones relating to the licensed products, which could, in the aggregate, reach a maximum of $5.5 million per licensed product if all milestones are achieved for such licensed product. Upon mutual agreement between Penn and us, we could elect to pay up to 100% of such amounts with shares of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Penn a mid-single-digit royalty, on a country-by-country basis, on net sales of licensed products covered by a licensed patent claim so long as the licensed product achieves and retains orphan designation, and if the licensed product does not receive or retain orphan product designation, we are obligated to pay Penn a low-single digit royalty on a country-by-country basis. We are obligated to pay Penn specified percentages of certain non-royalty payments and other consideration we may receive from any sublicense of our rights under the license agreements, with the specified percentage dependent on the timing of the sublicense grant. Penn controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. We also made an initial cash payment to Penn to cover all of Penn’s previously incurred patent expenses relating to the licensed patent rights. This license will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of all of the patents and patent applications subject to the license, the latest of which, if it issues as a patent, is currently expected to expire in 2032. Penn may terminate the license upon uncured material breaches by us of the terms of the license and upon the occurrence of certain events, including specified bankruptcy and insolvency events relating to us, or if we commence an action against Penn to declare or render invalid or unenforceable the patent rights. We may terminate the license at any time upon giving 60 days’ prior written notice to Penn.
University of Iowa Research Foundation
In December 2013, we entered into a license agreement with UIRF, which we amended in January 2016 to expand the list of patent and patent applications to which we have rights. Under the license agreement, as amended, UIRF granted us an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to a portfolio of approximately 96 gene therapy patents and patent applications owned by UIRF or jointly owned by UIRF and Massachusetts General Hospital related to RNA interference and gene therapy technologies, and to the results of a certain research collaboration among UIRF, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and CHOP, to manufacture and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights or discovered, developed, manufactured or commercialized through the use of the research collaboration results. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. In connection with the agreement, we issued shares of our common stock and made a cash payment of approximately $157,000 to UIRF, and we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones relating to the licensed products, which could, in the aggregate, reach a maximum of $1.3 million if all milestones are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to pay UIRF a low-single-digit royalty on a country-by-country basis on net sales of licensed products covered by a valid licensed patent claim. Commencing in 2017, we are obligated to pay an aggregate of $40,000 in annual license maintenance fees to UIRF, which are creditable against specified milestone and royalty payment obligations accruing in the same year. The license
maintenance fees and royalty rates are subject to increase if we, or any person or entity acting on our behalf, bring any action or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of the licensed patent rights. UIRF is responsible for prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights and we have agreed to reimburse UIRF for reasonable expenses incurred in prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. Upon mutual agreement between UIRF and us, we could elect to pay some or all of our payment obligations under the license with shares of our common stock.
The license agreement and our obligation to pay royalties expire, unless earlier terminated, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim, as defined in the agreement in the licensed patent rights (including patent applications) covering the manufacture, use, sale or importation of such licensed product in such country. Following the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties on a licensed product in a country, we will retain a fully paid-up, non-royalty-bearing, perpetual license to the results of the collaboration relating to such licensed product in such country. UIRF may terminate this license or render it non-exclusive at any time after October 14, 2018 if we have both (i) not put the licensed product into commercial use in any country and (ii) are not demonstrably engaged in a program directed toward achieving commercial use of the product, and if we fail to eliminate such conditions within a specified cure period following notice from UIRF. UIRF may also terminate this license upon uncured material breaches by us of the terms of the license, subject to a specified notice and cure period. The license agreement automatically terminates if we undergo certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. We may terminate the license at any time upon giving 90 days’ prior written notice to UIRF.
Selecta Biosciences, Inc.
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement that provides us with exclusive worldwide rights to Selecta's proprietary SVP™ platform technology for co-administration with gene therapy targets, including factor VIII for hemophilia A, as well as exclusive options for up to four additional undisclosed genetic targets.
Selecta's immune tolerance SVP, including SVP-Rapamycin, is an investigational technology intended to suppress the formation of neutralizing antibodies to an AAV capsid when used in combination with gene therapies, without altering the therapeutic profile of the gene therapy. Neutralizing antibodies form in response to an initial administration of an AAV gene therapy and prevent effective subsequent usage. The potential ability to re-dose a gene therapy may be beneficial where a patient has not achieved a sufficient therapeutic expression of the transferred gene in the initial dose.
Subject to the terms of the agreement, we made an initial $10.0 million cash payment to Selecta and purchased $5.0 million of Selecta's common stock. During 2017, we paid Selecta an additional $5.0 million in cash and purchased an additional $10.0 million of Selecta's common stock. Selecta will be eligible for up to $430.0 million in milestone payments for each target, with up to $65.0 million being based on our achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $365.0 million for specified commercial milestones. In addition, we will pay Selecta tiered mid-single to low-double-digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of any resulting commercialized gene therapy.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
We are aware of companies focused on developing AAV gene therapies in various indications, including 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Abeona Therapeutics Inc., Actus Therapeutics, Inc., Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., Axovant Sciences, Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., GenSight Biologics SA, Homology Medicines, Inc., Horama SAS, Lysogene SAS, MeiraGTx Limited, Nightstar Therapeutics plc, PTC Therapeutics, Inc., REGENXBIO, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., Solid Biosciences, Inc., Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., uniQure N.V. and Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., as well as several companies addressing other methods for delivering or modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against LUXTURNA and any of our product candidates.    
For LUXTURNA and clinical product candidates we have developed, the main competitors include:


• | LUXTURNA. While no other approved pharmacologic agents exist for patients with RPE65-mediated IRD, Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. has received approval from FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities for a retinal prosthesis medical device, which is being marketed to RP patients with limited or no light perception. Another retinal prosthesis medical device from Retina Implant AG has obtained a CE Certificate of Conformity from its notified body, and is similarly indicated for blinded patients. Novelion Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly QLT Inc.) completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of a vitamin A derivative to treat RP and LCA. In the gene therapy space, certain companies and several academic institutions have conducted or plan to conduct clinical trials involving RPE65-based product candidates, including MeiraGTx Limited and Horama SAS. To date, none of these organizations has completed a trial involving injection of a subject’s second eye or has initiated a Phase 3 trial.


• | SPK-CHM. We are aware that Nightstar Therapeutics plc, or Nightstar, is developing an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of choroideremia. Nightstar has obtained orphan product designation in the United States and the European Union for this product candidate for the treatment of choroideremia and has announced that it has initiated a Phase 3 trial for choroideremia. We are also aware that 4D Molecular Therapeutics and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG have pre-clinical programs in process.


• | SPK-FVIII. The standard of care for moderate to severe hemophilia A patients is intravenously administered factor VIII protein or its derivatives that are produced by several companies. There are other companies developing gene therapies to treat hemophilia A, including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, Shire PLC, uniQure N.V., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with Pfizer and Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy in collaboration with Sanofi. 

Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and 
acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly or earlier than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our product or product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product or product candidates against competitors.
Regulation of gene therapies 
In the United States, FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. The FDCA, PHSA and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, advertising and promotion of biologic products. Before conducting human studies with an investigational gene therapy, the sponsor must notify the FDA through the Investigational New Drug application process. Upon completion of clinical studies, the sponsor submits a Biologics License Application or BLA, to FDA, which then determines whether the product should be approved for marketing. 
Within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, or OCTGT, and FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, or CTGTAC, a panel of medical and scientific experts and consumer representatives, to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with NIH and the Regulatory Affairs Certification, or RAC, which makes recommendations to NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to gene therapies and their development. FDA has issued a growing body of guidance documents on chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products.
U.S. biologic products development process
The process required by FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:


• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to FDA’s Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;


• | preparation and submission to FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of animal and laboratory testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. BLA or new drug application, or NDA, application fees for products designated as orphan drugs by FDA are waived. 

Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by FDA.
Human clinical trials under an IND
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:


• | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


• | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase 3. The biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically

confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to FDA.
Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to FDA, NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving gene therapies. FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
NIH and FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
Compliance with cGMP requirements 
Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Sites in the United States that manufacture products intended to be distributed in the EU are subject to inspections by the competent authority in the importing EU country to ensure compliance with cGMP. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to FDA and the EMA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. Neither FDA nor the EMA will approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapies we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on symptoms, in conjunction with existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by FDA. For future therapies, however, it may be necessary to use FDA-cleared or FDA-approved diagnostic tests to select patients or to assure the safe and effective use of therapies in appropriate patients. FDA refers to such tests as in vitro companion diagnostic devices. On July 31, 2014, FDA announced the publication of a final guidance document describing the agency’s current thinking about the development and regulation of in vitro companion diagnostic devices. The final guidance articulates a policy position that, when safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on a diagnostic device, FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic device at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. The final guidance allows for two exceptions to the general rule of concurrent drug/device approval, namely, when the therapeutic product is intended to treat serious and life-threatening conditions for which no alternative exists, and when a serious safety issue arises for an approved therapeutic agent, and no FDA-cleared or FDA-approved companion diagnostic test is yet available. At this point, it is unclear how FDA will apply this policy to our future gene therapy candidates, or even to our current products. Should FDA deem genetic tests used for selecting appropriate patients for our therapies to be in vitro companion diagnostics requiring FDA clearance or approval, we may face significant delays or obstacles in obtaining approval for a BLA.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biologic product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $2,374,200. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics ($114,450) and an annual establishment license fee ($585,200) on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA.
FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
Upon completion of its review of the BLA, FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval letter also may impose certain conditions of approval, such as a REMS. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the application and may require the sponsor to undertake substantial additional testing or provide additional information for FDA to reconsider the application. If those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, FDA will issue an approval letter.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months after FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
Expedited development and review programs
FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.


• | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review.


• | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.


• | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.

Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy (which may include a cell therapy) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.    
Post-approval requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products.
A sponsor also must comply with FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications to healthcare professionals or patients, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost 
during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States that, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to, and accepted by, FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection that cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which FDA cannot accept or approve a biosimilar application.
Biosimilars and exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or PPACA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biologic product, referred to as biosimilars. For FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved until 12 years thereafter. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilars—companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA may be approved earlier than 12 years. As an innovator, we plan to file a full BLA to support market approval of all of our current and future products.
The 21st Century Cures Act
On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increasing funding for FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Cures Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes for four years the priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
FDA approval of companion diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. FDA has not indicated that it would require a companion diagnostic with LUXTURNA.
Government regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, sponsors are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of biologic products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not a sponsor obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a request for a Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with the European Union and the European Union Member State’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines, suspension, variation or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
European Union regulation and exclusivity
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biologic product under European Union regulatory systems, applicants must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization informed by the opinion delivered by EMA.
Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the European Union based on a full MAA (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product). Applications for marketing authorization for innovative medicinal products must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product to support their application. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are also entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. During these 10 years of market exclusivity, no generic or biosimilar medicinal product may be placed on the European Union market even if a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities in the European Union Member States. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of 
data exclusivity, another company, nevertheless, could also market another competing medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive 10 years of market exclusivity. During this 10-year period, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and European Commission may not accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal product for the same orphan indication. There are, however, three exceptions to this principle. Marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same orphan indication if:


• | The second applicant can establish in its application that its medicinal product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient quantities of orphan medicinal product.

An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for the conduct of pediatric trials. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation; for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar, in principle, to those in the United States. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan medicinal product designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan medicinal product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable no earlier than October 2018. Until the Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable, all clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive, which will be repealed on the day of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation. It will however still apply three years from that day to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opted for old system. The Clinical Trials Regulation will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the legislation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
Other healthcare laws and regulations
Healthcare professionals, physicians and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payers, existing or potential customers and referral sources are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:


• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The PPACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it;


• | the federal False Claims Act or FCA, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA;


• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare professionals and their immediate family members;


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and


• | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to: items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare professionals or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.
Coverage and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as Average Selling Price, or ASP, Average Manufacturing Price, or AMP and Actual Acquisition Cost. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, which is intended to take account of medical, social, economic and ethical issues when determining the suitability of a 
medicinal product for reimbursement is increasingly become an element of the pricing and reimbursement decisions of the competent authorities in European Union Member States.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increasing the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressing a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and establishing annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
With the new Administration and Congress, there likely will be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the PPACA.  To that end, on January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order Minimizing the Economic Burden of the PPACA Repeal. The Executive Order declares that, pending repeal of the PPACA, it is imperative for the executive branch to ensure that the law is being efficiently implemented, take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the PPACA and prepare to provide the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market. The Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to exercise their authority and discretion to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare professionals, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices, products or medications.
With respect to repeal of the Affordable Care Act and its replacement with new legislation, it is unclear when such legislation will be enacted, what it will provide and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the costs of healthcare. 
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
