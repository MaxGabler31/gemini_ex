ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
TiVo Corporation ("TiVo") is a global leader in media and entertainment products that power consumer entertainment experiences and enable its customers to deepen and further monetize their audience relationships. We provide a broad set of cloud-based services, embedded software solutions and intellectual property that enable people to find and enjoy online video, television programming, movies and music entertainment. Our solutions include content discovery through device-embedded and cloud-based user experience ("UX"), including interactive program guides (“IPGs”), digital video recorders ("DVRs"), natural language voice and text search, cloud-based recommendations services and our extensive entertainment metadata (i.e., descriptive information, promotional images or other content that describes or relates to television shows, videos, movies, sports, music, books, games or other entertainment content).
We offer our portfolio of products as both discrete component technologies for our customers to integrate into their internally developed solutions or as part of completely integrated modular solutions. Our integrated portfolio of software and cloud-based services provide an all-in-one approach for navigating a fragmented universe of content by seamlessly combining live, recorded, video-on-demand ("VOD") and over-the-top ("OTT") (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, VUDU, YouTube and other digital-first brands) content into one intuitive user interface with simple universal search, discovery, viewing and recording to create a unified viewing experience. 
We also offer advanced media and advertising solutions, including viewership data, sponsored discovery, audience insights and in-guide advertising, which enable advanced audience targeting for advertising through linear television, streamed content and other direct digital display and video platforms. 
Our solutions are sold globally to cable, satellite and telecommunications pay TV service providers, virtual service providers, consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, content and new media companies and advertisers. In the United States, we also sell a suite of DVR and whole home media products and services directly to retail consumers.
Our products and innovations are protected by broad portfolios of licensable technology patents. These portfolios cover many aspects of content discovery, DVR, VOD and OTT experiences, multi-screen viewing, mobile device video experiences, entertainment personalization, voice interaction, social and interactive applications, data analytics solutions and advertising. We license our patent portfolios for use with linear broadcast television and, as the industry extends into new video services through internet technologies, for use with internet connected televisions, personal computers, video game consoles, media streaming and mobile devices. We believe that an ongoing marketplace transition toward mobile viewing and device

proliferation present further opportunity to extend our patent licensing programs for new use cases and additional customer verticals.
We are industry pioneers having invented the IPG and the DVR. Today, we continue our strong focus on innovation with new advanced solutions for unified viewing of internet video and pay TV, cutting edge natural language voice-enabled technologies, entertainment personalization, audience management and viewership prediction solutions. Through our innovations, we have established broad industry relationships with the companies leading the next generation of digital entertainment. As the industry transforms to deliver more content over the internet, we are developing complementary products, services and intellectual property to address our customers' needs. 
Industry Background
Fragmentation. The entertainment marketplace is transforming as content moves from traditional broadcast distribution methods to distribution and delivery over the internet. The consumer entertainment experience is increasingly distributed across multiple screens such as televisions, tablets, smartphones and personal computers, via virtual service providers and content and new media companies. The continued expansion of network bandwidth, the influx of connected devices and the increased availability of digital content, along with increased accessibility through mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, are accelerating this overall industry shift and leading to changes in consumer behavior. Consumers are demanding higher quality personalized, interactive content experiences, where they can easily discover and access entertainment content across service providers and content libraries.
Home Media Complexity. Video content, such as movies and TV shows, continues to capture the majority of consumers' entertainment spending and viewing time. While many consumers have purchased large high definition televisions to maximize video enjoyment in the home, portable devices and services have made video content available to consumers outside the home. These portable devices and services must help identify what is available across linear broadcast television, DVR and VOD, as well as OTT services and digital-first content. For consumers, setting up the ideal home media environment is complex and requires integrating numerous devices, subscribing to multiple services (pay TV, internet and new media services) and often a deep understanding of media format compatibility. Simplifying the consumer experience in the home media ecosystem is critical to the successful evolution of the industry.
Pay TV Is Moving To The Internet. These portable devices and services, as well as new capabilities are impacting the full entertainment value chain, fueling new business models and increasing competition among existing market participants, while introducing new entrants. Distributors such as pay TV and virtual service providers, content and new media companies, retailers and others are seeking ways to strengthen their respective competitive advantages and increase their speed of innovation. Pay TV providers are engaged in a broad effort to enable subscribers to enjoy content where and when they want, on whatever device they choose, which we refer to as "TV Everywhere" ("TVE"). TVE is driving significant investment as service providers move from legacy distribution technologies to internet-based infrastructure for delivering pay TV services across broadband networks and wireless networks. 
Content Producer and Distributor Business Models. Content producers are also exploring new forms of distribution and business models to protect and advance their position in the distribution value chain. Many content producers are trying direct-to-consumer business models, exploring new forms of content licensing and additional hybrid business models which combine both traditional pay TV with direct-to-consumer distribution through either subscription or ad-supported monetization. Content distributors are looking to better understand consumer engagement, improve their services and expand their ability to market their content and services. Many distributors are also investing in original content or developing digital first content to establish a more competitive position, retain subscribers and protect their business from future subscriber losses. Combined, these changes are resulting in an overall increase in industry competition between content producers and content distributors, as well as increasing the number of companies distributing premium video content directly to consumers.
Consumer Electronics Devices. Global economic trends and increased competition have challenged much of the traditional CE marketplace and consumption habits are evolving beyond the TV and set-top boxes ("STBs"), gaming consoles and media streaming devices to a broader set of video consumption devices such as tablets, smart phones and media streaming devices. Consumers are demanding access to media on all their devices that can connect to video services. This has evolved into an ecosystem of multi-device functionality that requires extensive software development, cloud infrastructure and ongoing maintenance and support for these devices throughout their usable life, leading to higher costs for a CE manufacturer years after the initial device is sold. Consumers are becoming more comfortable managing multiple consumption endpoints driving CE manufacturers to seek an ongoing revenue relationship with their customers; one that expands beyond selling the consumer a new device every few years. This leads to a demand for add-on services and advertising that allow the CE manufacturer to monetize and profit from the ongoing distribution or maintenance of entertainment content over the life of a device.

Audiences and Engagement. As traditional media changes, the opportunities for advertisers are evolving as well. As television viewership has become more fragmented, advertisers are looking for new ways to reach audiences by managing consumer engagement across the many devices and applications in use. Additionally, the growth of digital online advertising has fundamentally changed the criteria advertisers use to evaluate advertising campaigns, adding metrics such as completion and guaranteed views. Consumption data, audience measurement and other analytics data and services that bridge a consumer's engagement across many devices and entertainment services are emerging as key capabilities required to capture advertising value across both pay TV and internet advertising. Virtually every major broadcast network has a significant program in place to enable analytics-driven advertising models.
Data Driven Economy. To enable this evolving advertising and media ecosystem, it is critical that advertisers, advertising agencies, broadcast networks and content producers and content distributors have broad access to granular census-level viewership data that can be anonymously matched with other information such as behavioral, demographic or purchase data. While much of the third-party data is available as a result of the relative maturity of the digital advertising ecosystem, this level of pay TV, OTT and digital first viewership data is still relatively scarce. Viewership data is a critical component required to identify, locate and market to specific audiences, as well as to enable effective cross-platform measurement and attribution.
Our Strategy
Television is rapidly evolving with proliferating content choices including traditional linear programming, VOD, TVE, OTT services and now digital-first and user-generated content. Further, consumers are accessing and subscribing to video content in new ways such as "skinny bundles" (which include smaller groups of channels) from incumbent pay TV service providers or through OTT services on tablets, smart televisions and streaming devices. This is leading to pressure on the content producers and content distribution business models and we believe we have created a best-in-class suite of products, advanced technologies and intellectual property that addresses the needs of consumers, pay TV service providers, virtual service providers, CE manufacturers, content and new media companies and the evolving advertising ecosystem. 
Entertainment Discovery, Access and Recording. Finding content to watch or record and watch later remains the foundation of the entertainment experience. We believe new discovery experiences integrating advanced personalization, live, recorded and online video on multiple screens with social engagement and new forms of interaction such as voice commands, will continue to be an area of opportunity. We also believe that metadata, which contains detailed information about entertainment content and programming, data on consumer’s entertainment interests and media engagement history, along with predictive analytics to interpret and utilize the data will be important in enabling highly personalized content experiences both in pay TV and video services from virtual service providers, CE manufacturers and content and new media companies.
Audience Monetization and Insights. Shifts in the value chain are creating new ways for consumers to gain access to content and new business models are emerging to capture consumers’ entertainment engagement and resulting spend. Monetizing audiences through content and media experiences across television and OTT services accessed through different devices such as smart TVs, tablets, smartphones, personal computers, media streaming devices and video game consoles, has become a critical challenge for the industry. We are focused on ensuring consumer privacy while delivering solutions that utilize consumer media engagement data to help service providers, content producers and advertisers better understand consumer behavior and better target and measure audiences.
Build on Key Customer Relationships. We intend to grow our business by expanding on the technologies that we provide to existing customers and creating new customer product and licensing relationships as more companies add media entertainment to their digital lifestyle solutions. We continue to accelerate our customers' efforts to address the industry's expanding needs for entertainment discovery, access, recording and audience data. We will continue to expand relationships with customers in various industry and market segments, including:

• | Pay TV Service Providers: Cable, telecommunications and satellite television providers that aggregate and distribute content over their own networks.


• | Virtual Service Providers: Content distributors that aggregate and stream content, including linear television, over broadband networks.


• | CE Manufacturers: Producers of content access points such as smart televisions, Blu-ray and DVD players, DVRs, video game consoles, mobile devices, streaming media devices, digital STBs and other connected media devices.


• | Content Producers and New Media Companies: Creators and owners of video content for OTT content, media distribution, search, social network and online retail companies.


• | Advertisers: Marketers, brand advertisers, agencies and advertising technology providers.

4


• | Retail End-Consumers: The entertainment consumer that aspires to create their own bundle of entertainment across available pay TV services, OTT, virtual service providers and new media.

Introduce New Products, Services and Technologies. We are developing additional technologies and solutions to meet the evolving needs of both traditional pay TV and internet distribution of entertainment from content owners and other aggregators. We are committed to expanding our technology base, to enhance our existing products and introduce additional products and services. Key areas of development include enabling our customer to transition to internet or streamed video delivery, powering natural language voice interactions, enabling personalized content discovery, monetizing audiences through sponsored promotions and delivering media engagement data to enable targeted advertising solutions. In addition to improving technologies in our current fields of operation, we intend to pursue emerging opportunities where we are positioned to drive growth in the business. This includes the impending launch of a platform to engage viewing audiences through a single unified content discovery experience across traditional TV and digital first content. This offering creates a guide for the streaming age by enabling content from the internet to be fully integrated with traditional TV and OTT services. We are enabling content producers, service providers and advertisers to promote and merchandize content in new ways. Central to this experience are streaming channels that bring video made for digital content, movies and a variety of internet video streams together in a single location that is easy to access across content platforms. This platform will let viewers access ad-supported free programming, a-la-carte purchases and subscription collections of their favorite internet-based content. Viewers will have access to categories like news, sports and entertainment and internet favorites from well-known content aggregators. TiVo will enable both our multichannel video programming distributor (“MVPD”) end-users and our retail customers to access all this content from TiVo Experience 4 with no applications to open. Content discovery will be seamless with an entertainment experience that is highly personalized for every viewer. 
Expand and Protect our Intellectual Property Position. We have adopted a proactive patent and trademark strategy designed to protect and extend our technology and intellectual property. We have built, and will continue to add to, a large intellectual property patent portfolio. The licensing of our intellectual property patent portfolio is a significant part of our business. We believe that our future success partly depends on our ability to continue innovating for the evolving media consumption marketplace. We have patented functionality for many aspects of our solutions in the areas of content discovery, DVR, VOD, TVE, OTT, multi-screen, personalization, contextual search and recommendation and other interactive applications, data analytics and advertising. Our portfolio of internally developed innovation is also enhanced by patents acquired from other industry participants. While we historically have licensed our portfolio for use with linear broadcast television, the industry transition to internet platform technologies is enabling new video services for television inside and outside the home on a broad array of media consumption devices. We believe this transition presents new opportunities for us to expand the industries we serve and to license additional patent rights, which are essential and/or useful as enablers of advanced media devices and services.
Pursue Strategic Transactions. When appropriate, we seek to expand our technology portfolio, improve our capabilities and extend or grow our businesses by pursuing licensing arrangements, joint ventures, and strategic acquisitions of companies whose business, technologies or proprietary rights complement and advance our operational and strategic goals.

User Experience ("UX") Solutions. Our UX Solutions allow service providers to customize certain elements of the IPGs for their customers and to upgrade the programming features and services they offer. Our UX Solutions provide viewers with current and future program information and are compatible with service providers' subscription management, pay-per-view (“PPV”) and VOD services. We also offer operational support, professional services and content metadata. Our UX Solution also has the ability to include advertising. When advertising is included, we typically share a portion of the advertising revenue with the service provider. We currently offer UX Solutions marketed to service providers under the TiVo, iGuide and Passport brands in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Service providers generally pay us a monthly per subscriber fee to license our UX Solutions. 
We also offer UX Solutions to the CE industry under the G-GUIDE brand in Japan. We receive license fees for these solutions based on the number of units produced or shipped that incorporate our technology or utilize our patents. Our agreements with the major CE manufacturers generally allow them to ship an unlimited number of units incorporating our technology, provided they pay us a fixed fee.

This technology platform delivers content faster and at higher quality than traditional editorial models can offer. There are five levels within the metadata portfolio: basic metadata (such as artist or album); navigational metadata (such as relationships between actors and movies or television series); editorial metadata (such as actor biographies, television, movie or music reviews); enhanced metadata (such as weighted keywords and connections 
6

across all entities in our library) and real-time metadata (such as sports play-by-play and excitement scores). Our focus on quality, robustness and consistent international depth has made us a recognized leader in entertainment metadata services worldwide. Looking forward, we continue to expand our portfolio, recently launching new products that support new media efforts from content studios, TV broadcasters and automotive entertainment providers. 
Our television and movie metadata includes information from 73 countries including the United States, countries in Latin America including Brazil, countries in Europe including Russia, Turkey and Poland, and countries in Asia including Hong Kong, India and Taiwan. We license several metadata and service offerings, including, but not limited to, schedules, listings and web content linking services. Customers typically pay us a monthly or quarterly fee for the rights to use the metadata, receive regular updates and integrate it into their own service. Our metadata can be sold stand-alone or as a complement to another TiVo product such as a UX Solution or search and recommendation solution. We deliver metadata using real-time APIs and as bulk data files depending on our customer’s requirements. Globally our metadata customers include leading companies such as Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ("Samsung").
Personalized Content Discovery and Natural Language Voice. Personalized Content Discovery with conversation services provides service providers, CE device manufacturers and application/service developers a way to enable their customers to quickly find, discover and access content across linear broadcast television, VOD, DVR and OTT sources. We process anonymous viewing information uploaded from STBs, digital media devices and consumer input for use in recommendations and personalization. The advanced algorithms of our technology understands the nature and relationship of content information and the context surrounding a user's behavior to deliver an advanced personalized content discovery experience. Results can be generated through traditional text entry, voice interaction or our content recommendations. Our natural language voice solution, when combined with our advanced search and recommendations technology, enables a conversational interaction between a viewer and their content experience. We have brought together advanced semantic and contextual technologies to enable powerful media centric voice interactivity. Combined with the expertise of our content editors and our comprehensive entertainment metadata, we deliver a powerful discovery solution. These technologies can be applied to pay TV, IPTV and video services from virtual service providers, content producers and CE manufacturers. Customers typically pay us a per subscriber or per device fee. Our search and recommendation solutions are widely deployed with many leading pay TV service providers including Charter and Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon"). 
Advanced Media and Advertising. Our Advanced Media and Advertising solutions enable pay TV and virtual service providers, content and new media companies, and advertisers and their agencies to better understand and monetize consumer media engagement.
We provide advertisers with nationwide or regionally targeted advertising on our UX Solutions. Advertisers place ads in a variety of display formats, seamlessly incorporated into the user interface. Advertisements can trigger a variety of actions when selected via a remote control, including video advertisement playback, DVR recordings and direct response. Media and conventional advertisers are interested in the value proposition of utilizing display advertising in television interfaces to reach consumers with an interactive experience or guide them to related media content. Utilizing our Personalized Content Discovery platform, we also target content promotions as ‘paid search’ by directly including the sponsored content in user interface’s recommended content carousel. We work with service providers bundling their non-TiVo advertising inventory with our native inventory giving us a more significant national footprint.
Our TV Viewership Data platform is built on modern big data technologies and processes millions of households of TV viewership data with program airings data. Our platform enables us to partner with service providers to unlock the value of their return-path data, transforming raw return-path data into meaningful viewership information to inform advertising, promotion, and marketing initiatives. Utilizing our TV Viewership Data, MVPDs, broadcasters, content producers, advertising agencies and advertisers can activate subscriber’s TV viewership alone or in combination with third-party data sources using industry-leading data safe havens to target directly, or through third party viewer segments, promotions and advertising to monetize their subscriber customer base.
We also offer a software-as-a-service Audience Insights solution used by service providers to analyze the habits and preferences of TV subscribers, providing critical insights that can be utilized to increase operational efficiency, improve customer engagement, support carriage and bundling decisions, help mitigate churn and maximize average revenue per user. Integrated with our Personalized Content Discovery solutions, Audience Insights processes millions of households of TV viewership data, programming data, billing and customer attributes data, as well as third-party sources providing service providers deep analysis of their subscriber’s second-by-second engagement and consumption of content.

Other
Analog Content Protection. Our legacy technology of analog video content security, commercially known as ACP, has been used to protect billions of videocassettes since 1985 and billions of DVDs since 1997. We license ACP directly to CE manufacturers and content producers, as well as semiconductor companies that supply the CE manufacturers. ACP can be licensed as a fixed annual fee, per unit royalty or, in some cases, as a one-time fee for a perpetual license. 
Intellectual Property Licensing Segment
Our Intellectual Property Licensing segment generated 42%, 49% and 54% of our Total Revenues, net for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Patent Portfolios. The foundation for our Intellectual Property Licensing segment is two expansive patent portfolios from Rovi and TiVo Solutions, which encompass approximately 4,200 issued and 1,500 pending patents. We have filed patent applications relating to thousands of inventions resulting from our research and development, including many critical aspects of the design, functionality and operation of TiVo products and services as well as technology that we may incorporate into future products and services. We continue to grow our patent portfolios in size and relevance through ongoing investment, targeted acquisitions and strategic management of the portfolios. We generate a substantial portion of our Intellectual Property Licensing revenue from our discovery patents, which represents 94% of our total patents. Over the last 10 years, our portfolio of U.S. discovery patents has more than doubled in total size; however, the number of issued patents in our patent portfolio has more than quadrupled. The scope and relevance of our discovery patent portfolios have also grown over this period, reflective of the increase in entertainment UX, DVR and mobile device media functionality. We believe that interactive video guidance technology is a necessary tool for television viewers facing an increasing amount of available content and an increasing number of digital television channels, VOD services and OTT services. The entertainment UX is evolving from a solution for linear television content to a UX for all the content consumers have access to across all of the devices they use. Our discovery patent portfolio includes important intellectual property coverage and protection for key features and functionality across guidance, search and recommendation, DVR, VOD, OTT, second screen offerings, mobile device media utilization and various interactive television applications. Our discovery portfolio's patents have expiration dates as late as 2038. We have extensive, ongoing innovation efforts in place to ensure the longevity of our patent portfolios so they continue to provide long-term protection across the key areas of our business and the media experience.
Protecting our Investment. From time-to-time, we engage in intellectual property litigation to protect our technology from infringement. We are currently involved in litigation against Comcast Corporation ("Comcast"), where we have alleged that Comcast is infringing our intellectual property. While litigation is never our preference and we prefer to reach a mutually agreeable commercial licensing arrangement, it is a necessary tool to effectively protect our technology investment. 
Multiple Licensing Segments. Traditional pay TV service providers typically pay us a monthly per subscriber fee and have historically licensed our discovery patent portfolio for the television use case. We have extended our pay TV licensing program to cover virtual service providers, who deliver pay TV services over the internet at comparable rates to traditional pay TV. As mobile TV initiatives have also become more prevalent with service providers, we have established secondary licensing agreements to provide coverage and rights for the mobile TV use case. Online and OTT video service providers typically have paid us a flat fee to license our patents for a specified period of time. Our CE licensees typically pay us license fees based on the number of units produced or shipped that utilize our patents, for specified products, in defined territories. Our agreements with the major CE manufacturers generally allow them to ship an unlimited number of units utilizing our discovery patents, provided they pay us a fixed annual fee.
Major Licensees. Our major pay TV service provider and video distribution intellectual property licensees include Altice USA, Inc. (including Cablevision), AT&T, Inc. ("AT&T"), Charter, Cox Communications, Inc, Sky plc, Verizon and many others. We also have license agreements with third party IPG providers. Our CE intellectual property licensees include leading CE companies such as Panasonic Corporation and Samsung. As of December 31, 2018, 160 million pay TV subscribers worldwide are estimated to be receiving a licensed UX or IPG solution, including 88 million internationally. 
Innovation and Development
TiVo Service Platform & Client Software. Over the past few years, the TiVo Service Platform and Client Software have undergone a significant refactoring. In addition to developing a new look and feel, our next generation TiVo Service Platform integrates all of our most advanced technologies and solutions, including advanced cross-platform conversational voice search, personalized recommendations, predictions and insights, extensive video metadata, robust data collection and new back office capabilities.

TiVo Enabled Hardware Devices. We continue to advance the TiVo software to operate across a variety of hardware platforms. In 2018, we outsourced the manufacturing and future hardware designs to a strategic partner, including for the TiVo BOLT VOXTM DVRs and TiVo Mini VOXTM non-DVR STBs. The TiVo Service Platform software includes a modular front-end that allows the basic platform to be used by hardware manufacturers to build STBs that support digital and analog broadcast, cable, IPTV, OTT and VOD services. In addition, our cloud-based TiVo Service Platform allows our hardware partners' devices and the internet to connect with third-party consumer devices and services to enable existing and future functionality. 
Personalization, Prediction and Voice. The ongoing investment in our Personalized Content Discovery platform enables us to provide some of the most advanced capabilities in media personalization, prediction and voice search. Built on a robust cloud architecture and widely deployed with Tier 1 pay TV and other providers, our solution is a leading technology in the market. We continue to expand this solution with innovations focused on new verticals such as, content promotion, internet video services and advertising.
Advanced Media and Advertising. We are leading the industry to use advanced technologies focused on television data to create efficiencies and value multipliers in the evolving television advertising ecosystem. Our TV data platform processes the raw TV viewership events from millions of STBs which our customers can anonymously match against billing, customer and a range of other third-party data. These capabilities can be used across a variety of advertising use cases in both traditional linear television and digital advertising for internet delivered content.
TiVo's Evolving Content Discovery Solutions. We are reimaging television to evolve the user experience to be the content discovery platform that breaks down the content silos and boundaries to create a truly unified media experience. We are integrating virtual channels of internet delivered video directly into the consumer's primary video consumption platform to provide universal search, discovery and consumption regardless of where the content originates. TiVo's UX will provide content producers with a platform for merchandising their content and allows consumers to build their own entertainment bundle to truly personalize their experience.
Supporting Operations
Operations and Technical Support. We have technical support and certification operations to support our products:

• | We provide training, technical support and integration services to pay TV service providers who license our products.


• | We operate the internet-based services required for our service offerings including data delivery, search, recommendation, advertising, device management and media recognition.


• | We provide broadcast delivery of television programming data and advertising to UXs on TVs and STBs in major European markets and in Japan. In North America, we deliver similar programming and advertising data via the internet.


• | We support our customers with porting and engineering services to ensure our IPGs and DVRs operate properly.


• | We provide customer care for UX and DVR customers to resolve data, advertising and consumer functional issues.

TiVo Service. We provide customer support through outsourced service providers as well as our internal customer service personnel for our direct-to-consumer retail TiVo Service in the United States. When our product is distributed through a pay TV service provider, the pay TV service provider is primarily responsible for customer support. We offer training, network operating center services and other assistance to these pay TV service providers. Our retail TiVo Service subscribers have access to an internet-based repository for technical information and troubleshooting techniques. Subscribers can also obtain support through other means such as the TiVo website, web forums, email and telephone support.
Seasonality. We generate a significant number of our new consumer subscriptions for the TiVo Service during and immediately after the Christmas holiday shopping season. We also incur increased sales and marketing costs in advance of the Christmas holiday shopping season.
Competition
There are a number of companies that produce and market advanced media solutions such as UXs, IPGs, DVRs, search, recommendation, natural language voice, metadata and advanced data and analytics in the various formats which compete, or we believe will compete, with our products and services over time. Principal competitive factors include brand recognition and awareness, product and service functionality, innovation, ease of use, personalization, content access and 
9

availability, mobility and pricing. While we are competitive across this range of factors, we believe our primary competitive differentiation comes from our ability to integrate all of our products to create unique value to our customers.
Platform Solutions: Our Platform Solutions face competition from companies such as Synamedia, MediaKind, Kudelski, SA, MobiTV, Inc., and Espial and from MSO internally developed solutions such as Comcast X1 and Liberty Global plc's Horizon Media, which have created competing products that provide user interface software for use on STBs and CE and mobile devices. Such companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers and CE manufacturers by bundling multiple products together. Another common competitor we encounter is a customer who chooses to build its own IPG and DVR solution, under license with our intellectual property. We believe that we provide a strong alternative to “do-it-yourself,” as we have innovative, high-quality products ready to be implemented, with local and network DVR, integrated data distribution infrastructure and content, as well as third party services (such as VOD services). We differentiate our products by continuing to integrate our broad portfolio of products into a suite of solutions and services for our customers. We believe our solutions can speed our customers' time to market, can be deployed at a lower cost than internally built products and can be superior to “do-it-yourself” products. For those that choose to do it themselves, we have component products such as advanced search, recommendation, conversation and insights, Cubiware middleware products and our extensive metadata offerings providing them a full suite of services to power their next generation in-house built media experience.
TiVo Service. The TiVo Service competes in the U.S. against solutions sold directly by pay TV service providers and virtual service providers. These solutions often have similar feature sets, such as DVR capabilities, search and discovery, multi-room viewing, and TVE access for mobile devices. Some of these solutions are offered at lower prices, but in many cases, are bundled with other services provided by the operator and the price for the DVR and DVR service may not be apparent to the consumer. In addition, the DVRs are usually professionally installed and may appeal to consumers who do not wish to pro-actively select a DVR service. The TiVo Service also competes against products with on-demand OTT streaming capabilities offered by CE manufacturers. Though these devices do not offer the breadth of the TiVo service, they do offer alternative ways to access TVE and OTT content. For example, many CE manufacturers have television or DVD products that are internet-enabled and others have built dedicated devices for accessing video over the internet such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast and Roku. Similarly, companies such as DISH Network L.L.C (Sling TV), AT&T (DirecTV NOW), Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") and Sony Corporation have now enabled the digital delivery of video programming over the internet to video game consoles and other consumer devices.
Metadata. In metadata, we compete with other providers of entertainment-related content metadata such as Gracenote (a subsidiary of Nielsen Holdings plc) and Ericsson Group's Red Bee Media. While we do not believe that our competitors' metadata sets offer the same comprehensive breadth of focus on media exploration, discovery and management in as many regions of the world as we do, they present competition to our metadata business for each of their areas of focus.
TV Audience Data. We collect and analyze audience research data in an area where companies such as comScore, Inc. and Nielsen Holdings plc and other online data analytics companies compete for research spend from advertisers, advertising agencies and television networks. Other large companies are also focusing resources in this area including Comcast, Facebook, Inc. and Google (succeeded by Alphabet, Inc.). Many of our existing customers are investing in significant platforms to enable their businesses with these capabilities. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for us as an independent data and technology provider, with proprietary access to critical data assets associated with consumers' engagement with entertainment media.
Intellectual Property Rights, including Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Tradenames
We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means, including but not limited to applying for patent protection domestically and internationally.
As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 1,600 U.S. patents and had approximately 600 U.S. patent applications pending. As of December 31, 2018, we also had approximately 2,600 foreign patents and approximately 900 foreign patent applications pending. Each of our issued patents expire at a different time based on the particular filing date of that respective patent, with expiration dates as late as 2038.

We own or have rights to various copyrights, trademarks and trade names used in our business. These include, but are not limited to, TiVo, Rovi, Passport, Rovi Guides, G-GUIDE, iGuide and Cubiware. We have secured numerous foreign and domestic trademark registrations for our distinctive marks, including but not limited to registrations, for the marks “TiVo,” the TiVo logo, “Season Pass” and certain sound marks.
Many of our competitors and other companies and individuals have obtained, and may be expected to obtain in the future, patents that may directly or indirectly affect the products or services offered or under development by us. We offer no assurance that any enhancements developed by us would not be found to infringe patents that are currently held or may be issued to others. There can be no assurance that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. In addition, patent applications are generally confidential for a period of 18 months from the filing date, or until a patent is issued in some cases, so we cannot evaluate the extent to which certain products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications prior to their publication. In general, if one or more of our products or services were to infringe patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the patent holders or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent. This could affect our ability to compete in a particular market.
Legislative and Regulatory Actions
A number of government and legislative initiatives have been enacted to encourage development and implementation of technologies that protect the rights and intellectual property of the content owners. For example, the U.S. and other countries have adopted certain laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), and the European Copyright Directive, which are aimed at the prevention of piracy of content and the manufacture and sale of products that circumvent copy protection technologies, such as those covered by our patents.
Compatibility Between Cable Systems and CE Equipment 
The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") has been working for over a decade to implement a congressional mandate to create a competitive market for cable television STBs and other devices to access video programming on cable systems (“navigation devices”) and give consumers a choice in the devices used to access such programming, while still allowing the cable systems to have control over the secured access to their systems.
To meet its statutory obligation without compromising the security of video services, the FCC required cable systems to make available a security element (now known as a CableCARD) separate from the basic navigation device needed to access video program channels. In 2003, the FCC adopted regulations implementing an agreement between cable television system operators and CE manufacturers to facilitate the retail availability of so-called “plug and play” devices that utilize unidirectional CableCARDs, including digital televisions and other digital devices that enable subscribers to access cable television programming without the need for a STB (but without the ability for consumers to use interactive content). In 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the FCC rules in a way that could have an impact on cable operators’ continued provision of CableCARDs to customers for use with third-party navigation devices. In December 2014, Congress passed the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization ("STELAR"), which repealed an FCC requirement that cable operators employ separable security (i.e., CableCARDs) in the STBs they lease to their subscribers effective December 4, 2015. STELAR also directed the FCC to create a working group to find a successor standard to replace the CableCARD. The cable industry has continued to provide, and committed to Congress to provide, CableCARDs for third-party devices like those supplied by TiVo to requesting customers. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of any new technical equipment regulations on our business and operations. Although current FCC regulations no longer prohibit multi-channel video service providers from deploying navigation devices with combined security and non-security functions, further developments with respect to these issues could impact the availability and/or demand for “plug and play” devices, particularly bi-directional devices, and STBs, all of which could affect demand for UXs incorporated in STBs or CE devices.
General Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies that import or export software and technology, including encryption technology, such as the U.S. export control regulations as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
We are also subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet. In addition, because of the increasing popularity of the internet and the growth of online services, laws relating to user 
11

privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, accessibility, network neutrality, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. Each jurisdiction may enact different standards, which could impact our ability to deliver data, services or other solutions through the internet.
We may be further subject to international laws associated with data protection, privacy and other aspects of our business in Europe and elsewhere, and the interpretation and application of data protection laws remains uncertain. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. Further, the application of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear. The resulting regulation, if any, may alter our ability to target advertising or provide data about the end-users and/or customers and their behavior.
In the U.S., service providers have been subject to claims of defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and other data protection claims, torts, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted or the content generated by users. In addition, several other federal laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the DMCA has provisions that limit, but do not eliminate, our liability for hosting or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of service providers to collect information from minors, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,700 full-time employees, of which approximately 650 were based outside the U.S. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any organized work stoppages. We believe that our future success will depend in part on the continued service of our key employees and on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We may not be able to retain our key employees and may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business in the future.
