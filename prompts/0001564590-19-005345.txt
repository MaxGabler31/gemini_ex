--------+---------

General
 CARBO Ceramics Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or our “Company”) is a global technology company that provides products and services to the oil and gas, industrial, and environmental markets to enhance value for its clients.  The Company was incorporated in 1987 in Delaware.  As used herein, “Company”, “CARBO”, “we”, “our” and “us” may refer to the Company and/or its consolidated subsidiaries.
 The Company conducts its business within two operating segments: 1) Oilfield and Industrial Technologies and Services and 2) Environmental Technologies and Services.  Financial information about reportable operating segments is provided in Note 14 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 The Company’s Oilfield and Industrial Technologies and Services segment manufactures and sells ceramic technology products and services, base ceramic proppant and frac sand for both the oilfield and industrial sectors.  The products have different technology features and product characteristics, which vary based on the application for which they are intended to be used.  The various ceramic products’ manufacturing processes are similar.
 Oilfield ceramic technology products, base ceramic proppant and frac sand proppant are manufactured and sold to pressure pumping companies and oil and gas operators for use in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells.  Hydraulic fracturing is the most widely used method of increasing production from oil and natural gas wells.  The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a natural gas or oil well at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation.  A granular material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture, “propping” it open once high-pressure pumping stops.  The proppant filled fracture creates a conductive channel through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation to the well and then to the surface.
 There are three primary types of proppant that can be utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: sand, resin coated sand and ceramic.  Sand is the least expensive proppant, resin-coated sand is more expensive and ceramic proppant is typically the most expensive.  We believe that the higher initial cost of ceramic proppant is justified by the fact that its use in certain well conditions typically results in an increase in the production rate of oil and natural gas, an increase in the total oil or natural gas that can be recovered from the well and, consequently, an increase in cash flow for the operators of the well.  The increased production rates are primarily attributable to the higher strength and more uniform size and shape of ceramic proppant versus alternative materials.  We are one of the world’s largest suppliers of ceramic proppant.
 We manufacture various distinct ceramic proppants.  Our technology suite of ceramic proppants include the following:
 KRYPTOSPHERE® HD is a high-performance mono-mesh ceramic proppant engineered to deliver increased conductivity and durability in the highest closure stress wells.  In challenging, high-cost environments such as ultra-deep wells, KRYPTOSPHERE HD retains its integrity and enables greater production and Estimated Ultimate Recovery (“EUR”) from the reservoir.
 KRYPTOSPHERE XT meets client needs for a lower density proppant than KRYPTOSPHERE HD, and the closure stress is lower than the application for KRYPTOSPHERE HD, but higher than KRYPTOSPHERE LD. Commercialization occurred in January 2019.
 KRYPTOSPHERE LD meets client needs for a lower density proppant than KRYPTOSPHERE HD, yet has similar characteristics and conductivity in high stress wells.
 SCALEGUARD® is a porous ceramic proppant that is infused with scale-inhibiting chemicals and placed throughout the fracture as part of the hydraulic fracturing process.  The infused scale inhibitor in SCALEGUARD is designed to be released into the fracture only on contact with water and thereby reduce or eliminate expensive remedial maintenance programs.  SALTGUARD® was commercialized in 2018.  The product has been shown to prevent salt build up in oil and gas wells.
 Our FUSION® technology improves well productivity by forming a stable, high-permeability proppant pack that prevents proppant washout from the non-compressive annulus and near-wellbore areas.

CARBOAIR® is a high-transport, ultra-low-density ceramic proppant technology that has been developed primarily to increase production and EUR from slickwater fracturing operations. The technology enables exploration and production (“E&P”) operators to avoid the introduction of gel into their fracs while improving reservoir contact and fracture conductivity.
 NANOMITE™ C is a micro mesh ceramic proppant which is engineered to prop natural fractures which are opened during the hydraulic fracturing process which would not normally be propped open. The resulting propped reservoir contact increases and the EUR is increased.
 Our RPM relative permeability modification technology is engineered to alter the wettability of proppant to neutral, preventing the retention of water-based fluid in the proppant pack. As a result, RPM technology increases the effective fracture length, conductivity and permeability of the pack to hydrocarbons, leading to higher production and increased ultimate recovery.
 In addition, we manufacture CARBONRT®, a detectable proppant that utilizes a non-radioactive tracer material to assist operators in determining the locations of fractures in a natural gas or oil well.  This tracer is added to the proppant granules during the manufacturing process, and can be added to most of the types of proppant that the Company sells.
 Our base ceramic suite of products include:
 CARBOLITE® and CARBOECONOPROP® are low-density ceramic proppants.  CARBOLITE® is used in medium depth oil and natural gas wells, where higher production rates can be achieved due to the product’s uniform size and spherical shape.  CARBOECONOPROP was introduced to provide a lower cost ceramic to compete more directly with resin-coated sand and sand proppant.
 We produce resin-coated ceramic (CARBOBOND LITE®), which addresses a niche market in which oil and natural gas wells are subject to the risk of proppant flow-back.
 Our sand proppants include CARBO NORTHERN-WHITE, which is a frac sand that is used by operators that still value quality, but do not wish to pay the higher costs associated with ceramic or resin-coated proppants.
 Our industrial ceramic technology products are manufactured and sold to industrial companies globally.  These products are designed for use in various industrial technology applications, including but not limited to casting and milling.
 Our industrial sand products are manufactured and sold to industrial companies.  These products are designed for use in various industrial applications.
 ACCUCAST® is a high-performance ceramic casting media that is engineered for precision performance.  Outperforming specialty and silica sand products, their unique thermal, physical and chemical properties reduce media consumption and costs, lower production defects and reduce energy consumption.
 CARBOGRIND® is a high-performance ceramic media that improves grinding efficiency while lowering operational costs for clients.  The durability of our ceramic grinding media results in longer product life, while the uniform size and spherical shape add efficiency to grinding operations and reduce wear on the mechanical parts of milling equipment.
 The CARBOBEAD™ family of high-performance ceramic media technologies are engineered to provide economic, Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) and performance advantages in a wide variety of industrial applications compared to sand and other competing synthetic media types.
 We also produce industrial products at our manufacturing facilities for third parties under tolling arrangements.  These products have been used in industrial, agricultural and oilfield applications.  Contract manufacturing has led to increased revenue generation.  We continue to develop additional opportunities within the industrial, agricultural and oil and gas industries to grow revenue, and to reduce our plant’s slowing and idling costs.
 Through our wholly-owned subsidiary StrataGen, Inc., we promote increased production and EUR of oil and natural gas by selling a widely used fracture stimulation software under the brand FracPro®, and providing fracture design and consulting services to oil and natural gas E&P companies under the brand StrataGen®.

FracPro provides a suite of stimulation software solutions used for designing fracture treatments and for on-site real-time analysis.  Use of FracPro enables our clients to optimize stimulation jobs to enhance oil and gas production.  FracPro has been integrated with third-party reservoir simulation software, furthering its reach and utility.
 The StrataGen consulting team works with operators around the world to help optimize well placement, fracture treatment design and production enhancement.  The broad range of expertise of the StrataGen consultants includes: fracture treatment design; completion support; on-site treatment supervision; quality control; post-treatment evaluation and optimization; reservoir and fracture studies; rock mechanics and software application and training.  
 Our Environmental Technologies and Services segment is intended to protect operators’ assets, minimize environmental risks and lower lease operating expense (“LOE”).  Asset Guard Products Inc. (“AGPI”), the only wholly-owned subsidiary of ours to operate in this segment, provides spill prevention, containment and countermeasure systems for the oil and gas and industrial industries.   AGPI uses proprietary technology to make products designed to enable its clients to extend the life of their storage assets, reduce the potential for hydrocarbon spills and provide containment of stored materials.  
 Current demand for proppant is extremely dynamic.  Most of our oilfield products and services depend primarily on the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, as well as on the number of natural gas and oil wells drilled, completed or re-completed worldwide.  More specifically, the demand for most of our products and services is dependent on the number of oil and natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured to stimulate production.  The demand for our products and services is also dependent on the commodity price of oil and natural gas, and lower commodity prices result in fewer purchases of our premium products.  In addition, our results of operations are also significantly affected by a host of other factors, including but not limited to (a) rig counts, (b) well completions activity, which is not necessarily correlated with rig count, (c) customer preferences, (d) new product and technology adoption, (e) imports and competition, (f) changes in the product mix of what we sell, (g) costs of developing our products and services and running our business, and (h) changes in our strategy and execution.  
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 81% of our consolidated revenues in the United States and 19% in international markets.
 Competition
 As the demand for ceramic proppant (including proppant produced by us) continued to be negatively impacted in 2018 by the severe decline in the oil and natural gas industry, the number of domestic and international competitors in the marketplace continued to decrease, and many of our competitors have shut down plants and/or reduced production.  However, we do not have full visibility as to the extent or duration of these shut-downs and reductions.  One of our worldwide proppant competitors is Saint-Gobain Proppants (“Saint-Gobain”).  Saint-Gobain is a division of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, a large French glass and materials company.  Saint-Gobain manufactures a variety of ceramic proppants that it markets in competition with some of our products.  Saint-Gobain’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in Bauxite, Arkansas.  Saint-Gobain also manufactures ceramic proppant in China.  Mineracao Curimbaba (“Curimbaba”), based in Brazil, also manufactures and markets ceramic proppant in competition with some of our products.  Imerys, S.A., a competitor based in France (“Imerys”), has ceramic proppant manufacturing facilities in Andersonville and Wrens, Georgia and also competes with some of our products.
 We are aware of a number of manufacturers in China.  Most of these companies produce intermediate-density and low-density ceramic proppants that are marketed both inside and outside of China.  Chinese proppant imports into the United States increased beginning in 2010 and 2011, which contributed to an over-supply of ceramic proppant beginning in 2012.  However, beginning in early 2015, imports declined significantly or stopped.
 Our KRYPTOSPHERE product line replaced both CARBOHSP and CARBOPROP.  Historically, competition for CARBOHSP and CARBOPROP principally includes ceramic proppant manufactured by Saint-Gobain, Curimbaba, as well as various manufacturers located in China.  Our CARBOLITE, CARBOECONOPROP and CARBOHYDROPROP products compete primarily with ceramic proppant produced by Saint-Gobain, Curimbaba and Imerys and with sand-based proppant for use in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells.  At this time, there is not in our view a comparable competitor’s product to our mono-mesh KRYPTOSPHERE product line, which is the subject of patent protection.
 We believe that some of the significant factors that influence a customer’s decision to purchase our ceramic proppant are (i) reservoir and geological characteristics, (ii) price/performance ratio, (iii) on-time delivery performance, (iv) technical support, (v) proppant availability and (vi) the financial status of E&P operators.  We believe that our products are competitively priced and that our delivery performance and customer experience is far better than the competition.  We have seen an increased usage of our technology proppants internationally and in North America, especially with E&Ps which are focused on increasing the EUR of their wells, are completing wells with higher permeability or are making attempts to lower their lease operating expenses (LOE).

The leading suppliers of Northern White mined sand are Covia Corporation, U.S. Silica Company, Hi-Crush Partners LP, and Badger Mining Corp. There are several other sand competitors (including the aforementioned) which have added in-basin capacity in the last year.  This is sand which has significantly lower quality (resulting in lower EUR and production), but is closer to where the wells will be completed resulting in significantly lower costs.  A large majority of our sand from our Northern White sand plant as well as the distribution center it is being railed into is under contract.
 Our industrial ceramic products enhance our clients’ performance for their manufacturing processes, products, and services.  The two primary industries of the ten market segments we currently serve are foundry with our ACCUCAST products and grinding applications with our CARBOGRIND products.  Our industrial sector has competitors across several industries we sell into.
 ACCUCAST metal casting media products are used by foundries to form high quality cores and molds.  During the past year, our sales activity has focused on North America and primarily in the United States due to the new OSHA PEL for respirable crystalline silica that went into effect in 2018 for foundries.  ACCUCAST ceramic media is a solution for the new OSHA requirements.  We utilize direct sales B2B and a network of qualified distributors.  Our competition in the North American foundry market includes several ceramic media manufacturers and the primary competitors in the North American foundry market is Itochu and Prince Minerals.  Itochu, based in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, is a diverse global company competing in many industries including Textile, Machinery, Metals & Minerals, Energy & Chemicals, Food, General Products & Realty, and Financial Business Services with distribution facilities and manufacturing located globally.  Their Cerabeads, casting media for the foundry market, is produced in Japan and distributed globally.  Sales are direct B2B and through a broad group of distributors. Prince Minerals, headquarters in Houston, TX, is a manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial additives.  They sell direct B2B and through distributors selling both internally and externally manufactured products.  Their Ceramcast, media for the foundry market, has been historically produced by a third party manufacturer in China with narrow product offerings for foundries.
 CARBOGRIND products are used in milling equipment for processing ore in the precious metals mining industry and other milling applications such as pigments, paints, and ceramic tile.  Within the precious metals mining industry, we sell globally through direct sales teams and distributors.  Competitors in the precious metals mining industry include Keramos, Magotteaux, Saint Gobain, Kings, and Cenotec.  The majority of these competitors manufacture their ceramic grinding products in manufacturing plants located in China.     
 We believe some of the significant factors that influence a customer’s decision to purchase our industrial ceramic media are (i) broad portfolio of superior ceramic products designed specifically to solve challenges for different industries (ii) excellent price/performance ratio, (iii) on-time delivery performance, (iv) technical support, (v) product availability (vi) consistent superior quality and (vii) the financial status of our clients.  We believe our industrial products are competitively priced and our delivery performance and customer experience is better than the competition.  Lastly, our superior technical support has enabled us to persuade customers to use our products in an increasingly broad range of applications which in turn has increased the overall market for our industrial products.
 
The ASSETGUARD™ environmental sector is divided into two divisions: a manufacturing division and a services division.  The manufacturing division supplies products into both the oil and gas and industrial markets.  The service business, operating as Falcon Technologies, provides services to the oil and gas market.  In 2018, oil and gas activity levels accelerated beyond those seen in both 2016 as well as 2017, and as a result additional competition entered into the market.  Falcon Technologies operates in the United States, and we are aware of at least two dozen competitors operating within the United States.
 
It is our belief that there are several key factors that are driving customers to purchase from ASSETGUARD, including (i) centralized manufacturing, which offers customers one stop shopping capability, along with a proven track record of on time delivery and competitive pricing, (ii) field services that are established across the United States as being professional, efficient, and reliable and centered on customer satisfaction, (iii) and the technical support available to the customer is unmatched in the industry, ensuring that the client receives timely response to their issues and quick resolution to any problem that might arise.
 Product Development
 We have broadened our product development efforts in 2018 to address the dynamic growth of the industrial, contract manufacturing, and environmental sectors.  Product development efforts are roughly equally split between oilfield and industrial applications.   
 SALTGUARD was commercialized in our GUARD® product line to prevent salt buildup in oil and gas wells.  
 CARBOGRIND, our superior line of grinding media, portfolio of products continues to grow. Many new product offerings were launched in 2018 as a direct result of our customers requiring grinding solutions to solve their grinding challenges. The portfolio of 
 4


products will continue to grow as our development team develops products with heavier densities, various sizes, and improve grinding performance. 
 QUANTUM™ service based on iON™ electrically conducting proppant continues to be the industry best method to directly measure hydraulic fracture dimensions.  This technology will become commercial in 2019.   
 Intellectual property continues to be a strong focus to support our technology leadership.  In 2018, ten patents were issued to the Company.  
 Customers and Marketing
 The customer base within CARBO is transforming as our revenue streams change from primarily oil and gas, to oil and gas, industrial and environmental customers.  The three business sectors are each utilizing different sales channels, including direct to the end consumer of our products and services, an intermediary which adds their services around our products, distributors and through ecommerce for certain products. We are seeing shifts in the purchasing behaviors of some of the end users of our products and have changed and are changing our sales and marketing efforts accordingly. 
 Our largest customers are participants in the hydraulic fracturing industry.  Specifically, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. and Keane Group which each accounted for more than 10% of our 2018 revenues.    We generally supply our customers with products on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders.  Continuing sales of product depend on our direct customers and the operators being satisfied with value creation, product quality, availability and delivery performance.  In addition, our ability to increase sales of our products and services depends on a favorable level of activity in the upstream oil and gas industry and expansion into other industrial and environmental business segments as well as capturing further market share in conventional segments.
 We recognize the importance of a technical marketing program in demonstrating long-term economic advantages when selling products and services that offer financial benefits over time.  We have a broad technical sales force to advise end users on the benefits of using our base ceramic proppant, technology ceramic products, fracture simulation software, and related consulting services. In addition we have added domain technical expertise within our industrial business unit to provide technical recommendations and ongoing support throughout the sales and ownership process. We also believe that our new product introductions and education-based technical marketing efforts have enabled us to maintain our position not only as one of the world’s largest suppliers of ceramic proppant but also as a leading innovator in the three sectors we sell into: oil and gas, industrial and environmental.
 Our international marketing efforts are conducted primarily through our sales offices in Houston, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Europe, and South America.  Our products and services are used worldwide by U.S. customers operating domestically and abroad, and by foreign customers.  Sales outside the United States accounted for 19% and 21% of our sales for 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The distribution of our international and domestic revenues is shown below, based upon the region in which the customer used the products and services:
 
 
 | For the years ended December 31, | 
--------------+----------------------------------+------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
 | ($ in millions) | 
Location | | | | | 
United States | $ | 171.2 | | $ | 149.0
International | | 39.5 | | | 39.8 
Total | $ | 210.7 | | $ | 188.8

Production Capacity
 We have adequate capacity to support present and foreseeable demand for our products. We continue to incorporate new methods and technologies to reduce our manufacturing costs and make our products more cost-competitive.   Our manufacturing costs per unit are typically inversely related to production levels.  When production levels increase, costs per unit tend to decrease, and when production levels decrease, costs per unit tend to increase.

Stated capacity of our facilities varies based on the mix of products we expect to produce.  The following table sets forth the current stated capacity of each of our existing ceramic manufacturing and other facilities:
 
 
 | Annual | 
----------------------------------------+----------------------+------
Location | Capacity | 
 | (millions of pounds) | 
Eufaula, Alabama | | 245 | * 
McIntyre, Georgia | | 275 | * 
Toomsboro, Georgia | | 1,000 | * 
Total ceramic manufacturing capacity | | 1,520 | 
Marshfield, Wisconsin – sand processing | | 1,500 | 
New Iberia, Louisiana – resin-coating | | 330 | **
Total current capacity | | 3,350 | 


* | Given market conditions, output levels at these facilities are at reduced levels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


** | Processing activities at the New Iberia facility primarily involve resin-coating of previously manufactured ceramic proppant substrate.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The retrofit of the first production line at our Eufaula, Alabama plant to produce KRYPTOSPHERE was completed in late 2015.  With this retrofit, we can now produce up to approximately 100 million pounds of KRYPTOSPHERE annually.  While this retrofit enables production of our new KRYPTOSPHERE technology products, it did not add additional production capacity.
 During 2018, our overall total ceramic plant utilization, excluding our Millen plant, which we sold in December 2018, was approximately 16% of stated capacity.  Our sand processing plant in Marshfield operated at approximately 73% of its stated capacity during 2018.  We expect improvements to our plant utilization in 2019 due to contract manufacturing growth.  We expect utilization at our sand processing plant to improve during 2019.  Depending on industry conditions, we can modify output levels or idle operations at plants as needed.  Refer to our discussion of impairment considerations in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Construction of additional manufacturing capacity beyond our existing facilities is not expected in the foreseeable future, and would be dependent on the expected future demand for our products, access to needed capital and the ability to obtain necessary environmental permits.
 Distribution
 We maintain finished goods inventories at each of our manufacturing facilities and at remote stocking facilities.  Our North American remote stocking facilities consist of bulk storage silos with truck trailer and sand box loading facilities, as well as rail yards for direct transloading from rail cars to truck trailers.  International remote stocking sites are duty-free warehouses operated by independent owners.  North American sites are typically supplied by rail, and international sites are typically supplied by container ship.  In total, we lease approximately 1,691 rail cars for use in the distribution of our products, of which we have subleased approximately 570 rail cars.
Raw Materials 
 Ceramic proppant and ceramic media are made from alumina-bearing ores (commonly referred to as clay, bauxite, bauxitic clay or kaolin, depending on the alumina content) that are readily available on the world market.  The main known deposits of alumina-bearing ores in the United States are in Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia; other economically mineable known deposits are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Gabon, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Russia and Surinam.  Bauxite is largely used in the production of aluminum metal, refractory material and abrasives.  We believe that our ability to purchase bauxite on the open market coupled with our current bauxite inventories will sufficiently provide for our bauxite needs in the United States during 2019.
 Our Eufaula, McIntyre and Toomsboro facilities primarily use locally mined kaolin for the production of CARBOLITE, CARBOECONOPROP and CARBOHYDROPROP.  We have entered into bi-lateral contracts that require a supplier to sell to us, and require us to purchase from the supplier, at least fifty percent of the Eufaula facility’s annual kaolin requirements.  The contract runs through May 2020, with an option for us to extend this agreement for additional three year terms.  We have obtained ownership rights in acreage in Wilkinson County, Georgia, which contains in excess of a twelve year supply of kaolin for our Georgia facilities based on full capacity production rates.  We have entered into a long-term agreement with a third party to mine and transport this material at a fixed price subject to annual adjustment.  The agreement requires us to utilize the third party to mine and transport a majority of the McIntyre and Toomsboro facility’s annual kaolin requirement.  Overall, we estimate that our fee simple and leasehold mineral rights 
 6


in the states of Alabama and Georgia contain approximately 19.0 million tons of kaolin suitable for use in production of our kaolin-based proppants.
 We utilize our own Northern White sand, CARBO NORTHERN-WHITE, and purchase third party wet processed sand reserves for our sand processing facility in Marshfield, Wisconsin, which supplies raw frac sand to the proppant market.
 Ceramic Production Process
 Ceramic proppants are made by grinding or dispersing ore to a fine powder, combining the powder into small pellets and firing the pellets in a rotary kiln.  We use three different methods to produce ceramic proppant.  Industrial ceramic media follows a similar process.
 Our plant in McIntyre, Georgia uses a dry process, which utilizes clay, bauxite, bauxitic clay or kaolin.  The raw material is ground, pelletized and screened.  The manufacturing process is completed by firing the product in a rotary kiln.
 Our plants in Eufaula, Alabama and Toomsboro, Georgia use a wet process, which starts with kaolin that is formed into slurry.  The slurry is then pelletized in a dryer and the pellets are then fired in a rotary kiln.
 The portion of our plant in New Iberia, Louisiana that manufactures ceramic proppant, as well as one line at our Eufaula, Alabama facility, uses a proprietary manufacturing process associated with the Company’s KRYPTOSPHERE product line.  
 Our rotary kilns are primarily heated by the use of natural gas.
 Patent Protection and Intellectual Property
 We make ceramic proppant and ceramic media used in foundry, grinding and scouring processes by processes and techniques that involve a high degree of proprietary technology, some of which is protected by patents.
 We own multiple patents in the United States and various foreign countries that relate to different types of ceramic proppant and production methods used for ceramic proppant and ceramic media; however, depending on market conditions, production of products pursuant to these patents may not necessarily constitute a material portion of our output.  We also own multiple U.S. and foreign patents that relate to methods for the detection of subterranean fractures and material, including gravel packs, in the near-borehole region.  We also own multiple U.S. patents that relate to detectable proppant.
 During 2014 and 2015, we obtained three U.S. patents relating to our KRYPTOSPHERE manufacturing process, during 2017, we obtained one U.S. patent covering the KRYPTOSPHERE product, and during 2018, we obtained another U.S. patent covering the KRYPTOSPHERE product, each of which expire in 2031, and another U.S. patent relating to our KRYPTOSPHERE manufacturing process, which expires in 2036.  Also, during 2018, we obtained two U.S. patents relating to our GUARD product lines, which expire in 2035 and one U.S. patent relating to our FUSION product line, which expires in 2037.  We expect these patents to provide assistance in the future sales of these product lines.  During 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, we obtained six U.S. patents, which expire in 2033, 2034, 2035 and 2036 and relate to our far-field proppant detection products, systems and methods which relate to our iON product line and the QUANTUM service line, which are still under development.   
 We own multiple U.S. patent applications (together with a number of counterpart applications pending in foreign jurisdictions).  A portion of the U.S. patent applications cover ceramic proppant, detectable proppant, processes for making ceramic proppant and detectable proppant, tracers for detecting produced fluids, diversion particles, detection of subterranean fractures, and our KRYPTOSPHERE, GUARD, FUSION, CARBOAIR, and NANOMITE product lines and methods for making and using these products.  Another portion of the U.S. patent applications cover non-oilfield or industrial products, such as water treatment compositions, foundry media, building materials and ceramic media for use in solar power plants.  The applications are in various stages of the patent prosecution process, and patents may not issue on such applications in any jurisdiction for some time, if they issue at all.
 AGPI owns three U.S. patents, which expire in 2026, 2027 and 2034 and relate to construction of secondary containment areas.  In addition, AGPI owns four U.S. patents, which expire in 2030 and 2031 and relate to polyurea-encapsulated tank bases.  AGPI also owns multiple U.S. patent applications, each of which relates to tank bases, equipment bases, portable containments, or components useful in containment areas in upstream, midstream and downstream environments.

We believe that our patents have historically been important in enabling us to compete in the market to supply proppant to the natural gas and oil industry.  We intend to enforce, and have in the past vigorously enforced, our patents.  We may from time to time be involved in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our patent rights.  In addition to patent rights, and perhaps more notably, we use a significant amount of trade secrets, or “know-how,” and other proprietary information and technology in the conduct of our business.  None of this “know-how” and technology is licensed from third parties.  However, we have negotiated a long term license for some third party intellectual property used or jointly developed in connection with our QUANTUM service line.
 Seasonality
 Historically, we have experienced higher levels of proppant and environmental sales activities during warmer weather periods and less during colder weather months in the northern and eastern United States.  In addition, sales activities can be decreased by the spring snow and ice “break-up” in Canada, North Dakota, Montana, and the Northeast U.S., as well as the winter holidays in December and January.  Our industrial ceramic media products are not typically impacted by seasonality.
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
 We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable domestic and foreign federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations.
 Existing federal environmental requirements such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, as amended, impose certain restrictions on discharge of air and water pollutants from our operations via permits and regulations.  Those pollutants include volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, storm water and wastewater discharges and other by-products.  In addition to meeting environmental requirements for existing operations, the Company must also demonstrate compliance with environmental regulations in order to obtain any required permits prior to any future expansion.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state programs require covered facilities to obtain individual permits or have coverage under an EPA general permit issued to groups of facilities.  A number of federal and state agencies, including but not limited to, the EPA, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources promulgate and enforce environmental regulations applicable to our operations in the states in which we do business.  Historically we have been able to obtain permits, where necessary, to build new facilities and modify existing facilities that allow us to continue compliant operations.  Obtaining these permits in a timely manner will continue to be an important factor in our ability to do so in the future.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 407 employees worldwide.  In addition to the services of our employees, we employ the services of consultants as required.  Our employees are not represented by labor unions.  There have been no work stoppages or strikes during the last three years that have resulted in the loss of production or production delays.  We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
 Executive Officers of the Registrant
 Gary A. Kolstad (age 60) was elected in June 2006 by our Board of Directors to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company.
