Item 1. Business
General
 
Toucan Interactive Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on January 24, 2014 and maintained its official business address at Sabanilla de Montes de Oca, Urbanizacion Carmiol, Casa 254, San Jose, Costa Rica.
 
From inception until April 2016, the Company’s principal business consisted of developing a website, www.NEEDforCREDIT.com, to provide credit option services to users primarily in Costa Rica, Canada, the United States and South and Central America and to market context advertising services to banks and financial institutions in these countries and regions.
 
In April 2016, pursuant to the transactions described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 22, 2016, the Company experienced a change in control (the “Change of Control”) and ceased operations as a provider of credit option services. The Company also changed the address of its principal executive offices to 25 E. Foothill Blvd., Arcadia, California 91006.
 
Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Company qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
The Company currently serves as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any industry, specific business or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The Company intends to establish a market for freely trading shares following the conclusion of a successful business combination and commencing business as an operating company.
 
The Company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:
 

(a) | filing Exchange Act reports, and 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | investigating, analyzing and consummating a business combination. 

 
We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our controlling stockholder, management or other investors. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company has $17,662 cash in the bank. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers and directors. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following factors:
 

(a) | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
(c) | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
(d) | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
(e) | The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials to be acquired; 
(f) | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced. 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. In evaluating a prospective business combination, the Company will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as reasonably possible.

We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. We cannot assure investors that our choice of a business combination will result in profitable operations.
 
The Company anticipates that business opportunities will come to the Company’s attention from various sources. These sources may include, but not be limited to, its principal stockholder, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. Currently, the Company has no agreements, whether written or oral, with any individual or entity, to act as a finder for the Company. However, at the present, we contemplate that our majority stockholder, BDK Capital Group, LLC (“BDK”), or certain of its affiliates may introduce a business combination target to us.
 
It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of “penny stocks.” The regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company’s securities until such time as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the “penny stock” regulations.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. It is also impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company may not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
