General 
 
Applied Energetics, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our executive office is located at 2480 W Ruthrauff Road, Suite 140 Q, Tucson, Arizona, 85705 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415.
 
On March 9, 2018 new management for Applied Energetics, Inc was put in place by the shareholders. Since that time management has undertaken a series of activities focusing on the reconstitution of the company. The executive team has developed a short-term action plan to address immediate issues in order to establish a corporate foundation to begin to build its strategic direction for the company. Immediate priorities of the company include:
 
1)       Assessing and publishing the status and nature of AERG’s current intellectual property rights and making that information available to shareholders.
 
2)       Recapitalization of the company and addressing outstanding debt currently on the company’s balance sheet.
 
3)       Corporate due diligence on previous company financial and stock transactions with particular attention on large dilutive events, including issuance of shares that were registered on the company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 and as executive compensation from March 2, 2015.
 
4)       Reestablishment of formal communications to shareholders including quarterly communications, meetings, and phone calls.
 
5)       Effectively using the AERG Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) with emphasis on building corporate brand awareness and participation in industry events.
 
6)       Continuing to build a corporate leadership team with strong industry experience and relationships to assist in market pursuits and business development.
 
7)       Launching a targeted business development effort to engage the US Government and its existing teaming partners and communicate the value of AERG’s intellectual property and corporate capabilities.
 
AERG’s executive team is committed to providing updates with respect to the nature and timing of events listed above. AERG’s immediate goal will be to leverage the current strength of its patent portfolio and its executive team’s experience in this market to develop a product road map that enables AERG to engage with clients on existing and new technologies.
 
Starting in the fourth quarter of 2014 and through the first quarter of 2017, the company reported as a “shell company” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended due to the suspension of its previous business activities in October, 2014. The company has developed a comprehensive research and development program and commenced R&D Activities in April, 2017. Accordingly, the company is no longer a “shell company” and is reporting as a “smaller reporting company”.
 
AERG has reactivated its previous business activities pursuant to Teaming and Consulting Agreements with (i) Applied Optical Sciences, Inc. (“AOS”), (ii) Stephen W. McCahon, Ph.D., one of the company’s founders, a significant stockholder of the company and owner of AOS, who was primarily responsible for development of the company’s existing Intellectual Property portfolio, and (iii) each of the members of the Scientific Advisory Board. 
 
The members of the Scientific Advisory Board (‘SAB”) have agreed to assist in our Strategic Roadmap Development, expected R&D activities, and provide a sound technical basis for future teaming, investment, and market analysis. These members have been chosen based upon their areas of subject matter expertise and senior experience levels that span both the Department of Defense (“DOD”) and commercial sectors.
 
AERG owns intellectual property that is integral and necessary for the development of Ultra-Short Pulse (“USP”) Lasers, Laser Guided Energy (“LGE”) and Direct Discharge Electrical products for military and commercial applications. AERG owns 40 patents of which 10 are classified by the DOD. The classified patents have no expiration date until such time as they are no longer classified after that they will have the normal 17-year patent protection.

We are in discussions with and expect to team with a major Defense Contractor for co-development and manufacture of military products. We will also anticipate teaming with a leading commercial laser technology manufacturer for co-development of commercial products resulting from our research and development efforts.
 
Applied Optical Sciences
 
AOS and Dr. McCahon have the facilities and together with the SAB, the technical knowhow to utilize the company’s intellectual property in the development of a next generation of Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers (“Advanced Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers” or “AUSP Lasers”). The parties have agreed to cooperate in the company’s research and development activities and in the proposal and fulfillment of research and development contracts for branches of the DOD, agencies of the federal government and other defense contractors and in other research and development activities relating to lasers. The company and AOS have a research and development program for the next stage of LGE development that involves the development of AUSP Laser Technologies. These laser technologies are designed to eventually allow for LGE weapon systems to be mounted on mobile platforms for multiple anti-terrorist missions including counter measures against Improvised Explosive Devices (“IED”), vehicle stopping, and many others. Importantly, the AUSP laser technologies required for successful LGE deployment leads to many new and unique emerging market opportunities in the commercial, medical, and other military applications.
 
AOS was founded in April 2010 to focus on the long-term research and development of advanced optical materials, photonic devices, Ultra-Short Pulse (USP) lasers and their applications. AOS is self-funded by Dr. McCahon. AOS has made significant investments to establish an approximately 3500 sq. ft. R&D facility that is divided into the three primary areas, Photonic devices, Ultra-Short Pulse (USP) laser development, Optical Thin Films and Material Science. AOS funded R&D activities have resulted in numerous proprietary advanced concepts and technical knowhow.  Recently AOS executed advanced USP laser hardware development under DOD funding using existing AOS proprietary concepts. Additionally, AOS has prepared laboratory space and hardware, and is re-configuring existing developmental testbeds in order to apply its proprietary technical knowledge to High Energy and Average Power USP lasers that will support the continued development of the company’s Laser Guided Energy technologies. This will allow for an immediate start on the Company’s R&D plan without significant capital investment or staffing.

Path Forward
 
Our goal is to increase the energy and power while decreasing the size, weight, and cost of USP lasers. We expect to develop very high energy and power scaled USP lasers that have a very broad range of applicability for Department of Defense, commercial, and medical applications. Although the historical market for AERG’s LGE technology is the U.S. Government, the AUSP technologies will provide numerous platforms for commercial and medical, markets creating a substantially larger product market.
Employees
 
As of March 29, 2018, we had no employees, and we retain a consultant who is paid on an hourly basis.
