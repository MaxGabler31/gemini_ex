ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Telenav is a leading provider of location-based products and services for connected cars. We utilize our connected car platform to deliver these products and services. Our connected car platform allows us to deliver enhanced location-based navigation services to automobile manufacturers and tier one suppliers, or tier ones. In addition, as discussed below, until August 2019, we utilized our advertising platform, which we refer to as our Ads Business, to deliver highly targeted advertising services to advertisers and advertising agencies by leveraging our location expertise. We reported results through June 30, 2019 in three business segments: automotive, advertising and mobile navigation. Our fiscal year ends June 30. In this Form 10-K, we refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and ending June 30, 2020 as fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our total revenue was $209.7 million in fiscal 2017, $218.5 million in fiscal 2018 and $220.9 million in fiscal 2019. Our net loss was $29.5 million in fiscal 2017, $40.8 million in fiscal 2018 and $32.5 million in fiscal 2019.
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and tier ones whose vehicles or systems incorporate our proprietary personalized navigation software and services. These manufacturers and tier ones generally do not provide us with any volume or revenue guarantees.
Our legacy mobile navigation business has declined steadily since fiscal 2013, and we expect it to continue to decline and represent less than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2020. Our mobile navigation business generates revenue from our partnerships with wireless carriers who sell our navigation services to their subscribers either as a standalone service or in a bundle with other data or services. The mobile navigation business has declined both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from $116.4 million, or 61% of our revenue, in fiscal 2013 to $9.8 million, or 4% of our revenue, in fiscal 2019, as subscriptions for paid navigation services declined in favor of free or freemium navigation services offered by our competitors with greater resources and name recognition, such as Google and Apple. We have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience the non-renewal of our agreements for these services by our wireless carrier customers as demand from their subscribers declines. In the event our mobile navigation business ceases to be profitable, we may ultimately elect to terminate our legacy wireless carrier mobile navigation business to the extent allowable under our contractual arrangements. 
We offer four variations of our connected car products and services to our automobile manufacturer and tier one customers for distribution with their vehicles and systems. First, we offer on-board navigation systems that are built into vehicles with all key elements of the system residing in the vehicle as a self-contained application along with the related software and content. Our on-board navigation products do not require access to the Internet or wireless networks to function. Second, we offer advanced navigation solutions that contain on-board functionality and also add cloud functionality such as cloud search, cloud routing, map updates and “live” data. We refer to these solutions as hybrid navigation. Third, we offer mobile phone-based navigation solutions that run on the phone and provide an interactive map and navigation instructions to the vehicle's video screen and audio system, which we refer to as brought-in navigation. Finally, we offer a Navigation Software Development Kit, or SDK, that enables our customers to add mapping and location capabilities to their cloud, mobile and on-board automotive applications. We believe our history as a supplier of cloud-based navigation services combined with our proven track record of delivering navigation solutions to three of the top five global automobile manufacturers provides a unique advantage in the automotive navigation marketplace over our competitors.
We provide our connected car products and services directly to automobile manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company and affiliated entities, or Ford, which represented 55% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, General Motors Holdings and its affiliates, or GM, which represented 18% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, and Toyota Motor Corporation, or Toyota. We also provide our products and services indirectly through tier ones such as Xevo, Inc., or Xevo, for certain Toyota solutions; LG Electronics, Inc., or LG, for certain Opel solutions; and Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America, or Panasonic, for certain Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, or FCA, solutions. 
In August 2019, we sold the Ads Business to inMarket Media, LLC, or inMarket, a provider of digital advertising services (the "inMarket Transaction"). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, inMarket acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities related to and used in the Ads Business. In exchange, inMarket issued to Telenav units of inMarket representing a 14.5% member interest in inMarket at the time of closing of the transaction. In addition, inMarket granted to Telenav a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, license back to the software and 
other intellectual property rights being assigned to inMarket as part of the inMarket Transaction. We will report the operating results of the Ads Business as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and for all prior comparative periods.
In August 2019, we entered into certain agreements with affiliates of Grab Holdings, Inc., which, collectively with certain of its affiliates, we refer to as Grab, including: (i) a services agreement pursuant to which we agreed that we will provide certain services to Grab through certain of our employees designated to work on our OpenTerra location-based services platform, which we refer to as our OpenTerra Platform; (ii) a license agreement pursuant to which we have granted to Grab a perpetual license to certain intellectual property associated with the OpenTerra Platform; and (iii) an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we will sell certain intellectual property associated with the OpenTerra Platform to Grab and facilitate the making of offers for employment or consulting arrangements by Grab of certain of our OpenTerra employees. The transactions contemplated by the services agreement, license agreement and asset purchase agreement together comprise the “Grab Transaction.” The consideration for the services agreement, license agreement and asset purchase agreement is a mix of cash and Grab Holdings, Inc. ordinary shares. The asset purchase component of the Grab Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close before June 30, 2020.
Automotive Navigation
Industry background
The automotive industry is going through a significant transformation due to the convergence of connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification, or CASE. In addition, due to high consumer expectations set by mobile phones, consumers are demanding user friendly products that are well integrated, always up-to-date and easy to use. Our market research has shown that in-vehicle infotainment is one of the features that drivers value most when purchasing a new car. 
We believe, and market studies by Strategy Analytics, a leading automotive market research firm, indicate, navigation has been and will continue to be one of the highest demanded features within in-vehicle infotainment systems. With the current CASE trends, navigation and the navigation platform will become increasingly important because the services used for in-vehicle infotainment either stem from or must work with the navigation system. Therefore, navigation will become integral to providing a seamless infotainment experience. For example, driver safety continues to be a key priority for government regulators and automobile manufacturers globally, and the European New Car Assessment Program, or NCAP gives safety incentive points to vehicles with Speed Assist Systems, or SAS features, some of which require mapping and navigation software. Due to these pressures, automobile manufacturers are adding navigation as a standard feature on more vehicles.
In addition, navigation is an essential aspect of autonomous vehicles, as mapping and navigation are required to localize the vehicle and guide it to its destination. For shared mobility, finding the nearest vehicle to a rider and routing the vehicle requires mapping and navigation. For electric vehicles, range planning, optimization of energy use and finding charging stations along the route are enabled by mapping and navigation. For these reasons, navigation is becoming increasingly important and a key element of future vehicle infotainment and safety systems.
Industry challenges
The automotive industry is experiencing increasing pressures from new entrants, such as Tesla, and other industries, such as the software industry, that have fast innovation and execution, which enable them to capitalize on current trends. As a result, traditional automobile manufacturers are striving to keep up with consumer demands for new and updated content on the infotainment system, which previously was not capable of being updated without inconveniencing the consumer. According to Strategy Analytics, customers consider on-board access to connected applications an important factor in determining their purchase decision. Consumers are strongly indicating their desire to access connected apps through their vehicle’s controls and displays. Automobile manufacturers that enhance the in-vehicle experience with cloud connectivity and improved infotainment capabilities can find greater acceptance from consumers, but the delivery of these capabilities is technically challenging and not a traditional part of the automobile manufacturer's capabilities or supply chain. This challenge is driving automobile manufacturers to seek new partners to create differentiated in-car experiences. Automobile manufacturers are also under pressure because of the proliferation of brought-in platforms and products such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto along with other initiatives, including Open Automotive Alliance, which take control of the products and platforms away from automobile manufacturers and tier ones and could diminish brand loyalty to the automobile manufacturer. To counter this, automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in their infotainment solutions and leveraging their ability to provide better integration of the various automobile systems resulting in easy-to-use hybrid navigation services that are seamlessly integrated with in-vehicle displays (center screen, cluster, heads up display, rear-seat), speakers, voice recognition and vehicle sensors.
Our competitive strengths
Automobile manufacturers procure various elements of each vehicle that they manufacture from third party suppliers directly and through tier ones. We work directly with automobile manufacturers such as Ford, GM and Toyota, as well as through tier ones. Our strong track record as a provider of connected and personalized navigation services to mobile phones and our history of working with large wireless carriers has helped us develop skills and technology that are well suited to meet the demands faced by today's automobile manufacturers and tier ones. The sales cycle for automotive navigation systems is long, consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the automobile manufacturer and tier ones to succeed in securing business. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it define the ultimate product that it delivers to its end users in a way that not only enhances customer experience but also allows the automobile manufacturer to differentiate itself from the competition. We believe that our success with on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation solutions at Ford and GM, and the continuing shift in emphasis to connected services has demonstrated the strength of our offerings to other automobile manufacturers and tier ones. Through our ongoing collaboration with automobile manufacturers, we remain aligned with their goals and offer solutions that allow them to differentiate themselves from other competitors, providing their users with a superior experience and, as a result, creating brand loyalty among their customers.
Our automotive products and services
We entered the automotive navigation services business in fiscal 2008, initially with Ford, and our first on-board navigation product was launched in Ford's model year 2010 vehicles. Since that time, we have been working with Ford and other automobile manufacturers and tier ones to deploy our various navigation products and services worldwide through on-board, brought-in and hybrid systems. 
Ford currently distributes our on-board product as a standard or optional feature in certain of its models and locations. More recently, this solution has been enhanced with a phone-based connectivity feature providing key search capabilities. Our navigation products are now included in Ford models principally manufactured and sold in North America, South America, Europe and China, as well as distributed in models sold in Australia and New Zealand. In each geography where we provide navigation products to Ford, Ford also provides a map update program under which Ford owners in North America, South America, China and Europe with SYNC® 3 and in Australia and New Zealand with SYNC® 2 or SYNC 3 are eligible to receive annual map updates at no additional cost through the contractual period with the respective entity. 
In December 2017, we announced that Ford had chosen Telenav to provide its next generation navigation solution in North America, subject to certain conditions and execution of an agreement regarding those solutions. The terms of this next generation navigation solution were embodied in an amendment executed in December 2018. We were not awarded the contracts for Europe, South America and Australia and New Zealand. 
We also have agreements with GM to provide our on-board and hybrid navigation solutions in its vehicles. Our navigation SDK powers GM's OnStar RemoteLink, and associated branded mobile applications, MyBuick, MyCadillac, MyChevrolet and MyGMC. In February 2017, GM launched its first model featuring integration of our hybrid navigation solution in North America, the 2017 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V. Our solution is currently available in North America on select 2019 models of Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick. GM has also launched vehicles with our hybrid navigation solution in China and the Middle East. Our hybrid navigation solution is scheduled to become available in additional regions and GM models for model years 2020 to 2025.
We provide entry level on-board navigation through LG, a tier one supplier for the Opel and Vauxhall line of vehicles, for the European market, even after the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall brands to PSA Group in August 2017. This solution launched in Opel's Adam, Corsa, Karl and Zafira model vehicles in July 2017. Our solution is expected to be made available in select vehicles for model years 2020 to 2022.
We have a partnership with Toyota for brought-in navigation services where our Scout GPS Link mobile application is enabled to connect with select Toyota and Lexus models in the United States and Canada. Toyota and Lexus vehicles enabled to connect with our Scout GPS Link began shipping in August 2015 and September 2016, respectively. In addition, we have an agreement with Xevo, Inc., a tier one supplier to Toyota, whereby our Scout GPS Link and XevoTM Engine Link provide brought-in navigation services, including a fully interactive moving map, for select Toyota vehicles equipped with Entune 3.0 Audio, as well as select Lexus vehicles equipped with Lexus Enform. Our fully interactive solution first became available on select model year 2018 Toyota Camry and Sienna and Lexus NX and RC models, and was recently expanded to select model year 2019 Toyota Corolla hatchback, Avalon, CHR and RAV4 models, as well as Lexus UX and select model year 2020 Corolla sedans and Prius Prime. On these same Toyota and Lexus models, a premium embedded connected navigation option is also available that provides cloud-based search, powered by our navigation SDK. 
While we saw expansion of our latest version of Scout GPS Link solution across more Toyota and Lexus models in fiscal 2019, we expect Toyota to limit or reduce the number of models or vehicles on which Scout GPS Link is offered by Toyota and Lexus, beginning in model year 2021, due in part to the offering of alternative brought-in solutions such as Apple’s CarPlay, which Toyota is offering across certain Toyota models, and the expanded offering of Google’s Android Auto solution across more automobile manufacturers.
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Telenav entered into an amended agreement with Xevo. The amended agreement provides that we will receive a one-time $17.0 million cash pre-payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in exchange for removing a contractual minimum unit commitment that otherwise would have resulted in a payment to us in fiscal 2027. We recorded the receivable as deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and it will be recognized as revenue over future periods. Our contract with Xevo relating to the implementation of our solutions in Toyota and Lexus vehicles is expected to remain in place through 2026, and we are exploring additional opportunities with Xevo and Toyota as well.
In August 2017, Daimler AG, or Mercedes, selected Telenav’s enhanced OpenStreetMap, or OSM, platform and navigation SDK to power its Mercedes-Benz COMAND TOUCH® Rear Seat Entertainment system throughout the world. In May 2019, we announced that our solution will provide fully interactive mapping for rear seat entertainment and will be launched as optional equipment on the current Mercedes E-class and S-class models.
We also have an agreement to offer our on-board navigation solution in select Jeep and Chrysler vehicles in the China market through Panasonic. Our on-board navigation solution was initially included in the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which had its China launch in August 2017, and is now included in other Jeep Cherokee and Compass models in China.
Going forward, we anticipate more automobile manufacturers and tier ones will offer our hybrid navigation solutions with up-to-date data such as traffic, fuel prices, maps and points of interest, or POIs, to deliver an enhanced user experience. In addition, as the market transitions to cars that are “always connected,” we expect our product and service offerings to become more personalized, safer and seamlessly integrated with other functions in the infotainment system, resulting in a better overall user experience. 
Platform and architecture
Our automotive navigation product architecture is designed with flexibility in mind such that we may deliver custom solutions efficiently, to meet the unique requirements of automobile manufacturers and tier ones. We have created and continue to enhance our automotive reference product, or ARP, which serves as the foundation for our custom solutions and allows us to show automobile manufacturers our latest on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation capabilities. In addition, we provide our cloud services via a standard application programming interface, or API, via our navigation SDK for those manufacturers seeking cloud services only, such as GM's mobile companion app. 
We have developed proprietary technologies to provide location-based on-board, brought-in and hybrid mapping and navigation services. Our on-board navigation products include a broad set of services including local search for addresses and business, converting addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates known as geocoding, routing, map rendering, traffic decoding and processing, multi-level map matching, map updates, navigation and guidance. We have also developed customized technology to improve the quality of speech recognition for address and POI searches.
Our cloud location-based services platform includes our engines for routing, mapping, local search, voice recognition, geo data aggregation, traffic, personalization, and sensor processing. We leverage our existing back-end cloud technologies for deployment to automobile manufacturer and tier one applications.
Our proprietary location-based services platform provides fast route and map generation while optimizing the route based on real-time traffic conditions. It also includes a local search technology so users can find addresses and POIs easily, to which users can then be routed. Because our proprietary platform uses computing resources efficiently, we are able to scale our servers economically for our automotive solutions.
Our back-end cloud services allow us to deliver up-to-date location based data and services to support our on-board navigation technologies. Our platform is designed to be content agnostic and offers the flexibility to use various data providers for maps, POIs, traffic and other location-based content services. This enables the automobile manufacturer or tier one to offer best of breed content, by region, to delight their drivers. It also allows more competitive content pricing by offering the automobile manufacturer or tier one the option of seeking bids from more than one content provider. We have expanded our navigation offering to add Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, capabilities. Our initial ADAS feature, called e-horizon, predicts the path of the user and extracts relevant map attributes to tell the vehicle about upcoming road characteristics 
such as curvature and elevation. This information may be used by the vehicle to alert the driver of unsafe conditions, actuate the car and also improve fuel economy.
In January 2014, we acquired skobbler GmbH, or skobbler, a leading provider of technologies that enhance the collection and use of OSM mapping data. By combining skobbler's technologies with other proprietary Telenav technologies, we have developed our OpenTerra Platform, which includes a range of OSM capabilities that allow us to use crowd sourced maps for more advanced services such as navigation. We deployed OSM as part of our Toyota Entune Audio Plus and Lexus Display Audio multimedia products. In addition, the agreements entered into with Grab in August 2019 provide for the license to Grab of certain intellectual property underlying our OpenTerra Platform and represent an important step in monetizing the OpenTerra platform. While the agreements with Grab also provide for the sale of that intellectual property to Grab, we plan to leverage the license back to that intellectual property that we will receive from Grab to continue the development of the OpenTerra Platform and may potentially enter into similar licensing arrangements relating to our OSM mapping technologies with other third parties in the future. 
Infrastructure and operations
Automotive Navigation
Our end users rely on our services primarily while on the road. As a result, we strive to ensure the continuous availability of our services through our high quality hosting platform and operational excellence.
Data center facilities. We developed our infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the availability of our applications, which are hosted on a highly scalable and available network located in Amazon Web Services, or AWS, facilities in California, Oregon, Virginia, Germany, Ireland and South Korea. 
We entered into hosted service agreements with AWS for primary resource capacity and disaster recovery capacity. Pursuant to the service agreements, AWS provides leased facility space, power, cooling and Internet connectivity for a term of one year, and such agreements are subject to renewal.
We have similar arrangements with Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s cloud computing business unit, Alibaba Cloud, to provide hosting services for our location services in China.
Research and development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our services and products. Our engineering team has deep expertise and experience in in-car embedded software, mobile software, location technologies and cloud services and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with location services applications and scaling hosted service models.
Our current research and development efforts are focused on: 

• | timely execution and delivery of contracted customer solutions;


• | enhancing our unified platform that enables more efficient deployment of our solutions across multiple customers and programs;


• | improving and expanding features, functionality and performance of our existing services;


• | creating new applications, services and functionality for vehicles and mobile phones;


• | developing key technology and content to reduce third party costs; and


• | building features and functionality that allow OSM to be enhanced.

Our development strategy is to identify features, services and products that are, or are expected to be, needed or desired by end users and provide our customers with a means to differentiate themselves against their competitors. 
As of June 30, 2019, our research and development team consisted of 653 people, 159 of whom were located in Santa Clara and Culver City, California and 494 of whom were located in Cluj, Romania; Shanghai and Xi'an, China; Berlin, Germany; and Incheon, South Korea. Our U.S., China and Romanian research and development teams function together to provide service and product development for our automotive customers. Our research and development expenses were $67.4 
million, $85.6 million and $84.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. In August 2019, in connection with the inMarket Transaction, 11 employees engaged in research and development in our Culver City, California location left the Company.
Marketing and sales
Automotive Navigation
In connection with sales efforts directed at automobile manufacturers and tier ones, we employ a sales team that focuses on targeted customers and responds to requests for proposals and related sales opportunities.
The development and sales cycle for automotive navigation products and services is long. The automotive sales cycle is consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the customer to succeed in securing a design win. A typical sales cycle is 12 to 18 months long. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it to define the ultimate product that it chooses to deliver to its end users. Generally, design wins for vehicles are awarded 24 to 36 months prior to the anticipated model year launch of the vehicle, as it takes this much time to develop and integrate the software and cloud services. Once we launch services with an automobile manufacturer, our application and services are typically bundled with vehicles for multiple years.
Customers
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and tier ones whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our navigation services. To a lesser extent, we have legacy relationships with wireless carrier customers to provide mobile navigation services to their subscribers through mobile phones.
We generate revenue from automobile manufacturers and tier ones for delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software for on-board and hybrid automotive navigation solutions. In addition, we earn royalties from brought-in navigation services for vehicle applications powered by our location-based services platform. We typically enter into long term supply arrangements with our automotive customers to provide our solutions across multiple car models in multiple regions around the world.
Our revenue from customers located in the United States comprised 90%, 90% and 81% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
We are substantially dependent on Ford and GM for our billings and revenue. In fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, Ford represented 71%, 67% and 55% of our revenue, respectively, and 68%, 66% and 50% of billings, respectively. In fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, GM represented less than 10%, less than 10% and 18% of our revenue, respectively, and less than 10%, less than 10% and 19% of billings, respectively. We expect Ford and GM to represent a significant portion of our revenue and billings for the foreseeable future. 
Ford
Our contract with Ford covers a broad range of products and services that we provide to Ford. On March 28, 2018, we entered into an amendment with Ford that extends the term of the agreement from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020 for each jurisdiction in which we currently provide our products to Ford. On December 14, 2017, Ford also selected us to provide its next generation navigation solution in North America, subject to certain conditions and execution of an agreement regarding those solutions. The terms of this next generation navigation solution were embodied in an amendment executed in December 2018. With respect to North America production, this amendment extended the term of the agreement to December 31, 2022, which term may be further extended at Ford’s option subject to certain conditions. We were not awarded the contracts for Europe, South America and Australia and New Zealand. 
We are the preferred provider for on-board navigation integrated with Ford's SYNC 2 and SYNC 3 platforms during the term of the agreement. 
We have also entered into amendments with Ford such that Ford Europe and Ford Australia and New Zealand also provide a map update program under which Ford owners with SYNC 2, with respect to Australia and New Zealand only, or SYNC 3 in all geographies where we provide SYNC 3 products are eligible to receive annual map updates at no additional cost through the contractual period. 
In fiscal 2017, we also entered into amendments of our agreement with Ford pursuant to which Ford’s joint venture in China, Changan Ford Automobile Co., Ltd., became the primary contracting party for our relationship with Ford in that region.
Our agreement with Ford relating to navigation solutions integrated with Ford's SYNC 2 and SYNC 3 platforms allows for renewals for successive 12-month periods if either party provides notice of renewal at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term, and the other party agrees to such renewal. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party is insolvent or materially breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach. Under our agreement with Ford, we are required to become certified under a set of technical standards for the computer software development process in the automobile industry, which requirement currently requires certification by the fall of 2019. We do not currently have any such certification, and we may not be able to obtain it in a timely manner, if at all, for our software to be included in Ford’s model year 2021 vehicles.
GM 
Our contract with GM includes the provision of our on-board, hybrid, and brought-in navigation solutions across a wide assortment of GM vehicles. Our mobile navigation SDK powers GM’s branded mobile and web-based applications and is covered under a services agreement that was entered into June 13, 2014 and extends to December 31, 2019. Our on-board and hybrid navigation solutions for GM are covered under a product and services agreement that became effective February 1, 2017. These solutions began shipping in a limited number of vehicles beginning with model year 2017 and are gradually expanding across additional regions and models. In May 2017, additional vehicles through model year 2025 were added to this products and services agreement, which terminates on December 31, 2026. Our agreement with GM allows either party to terminate the agreement if the other party is insolvent or breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach, and permits GM to terminate at its convenience.
Our hybrid navigation solutions are available on select model year 2019 GM vehicles in markets including North America, Australia and New Zealand, and in China with Shanghai-GM, or SGM. Our on-board navigation solutions are available on select model year 2019 Opel vehicles. We have also started offering our hybrid and on-board navigation solutions in select model year 2020 GM vehicles. Under our agreements with GM, we are obligated to provide our navigation products and services for additional models and regions through model year 2025.
Indemnification under automotive customer agreements
Under our agreements with Ford and GM, we have obligations to indemnify each of them against, among other things, losses arising out of or in connection with any claim that our technology or services infringe third party proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our agreements with each of Ford and GM may be terminated in the event an infringement claim is made against us and it is reasonably determined that there is a possibility our technology or service infringed upon a third party's rights.
Safeguards against unauthorized data usage
We employ administrative, physical and technical safeguards as part of our efforts to prevent unauthorized collection, access, use and disclosure of our end users' private data and to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. We do not use any end user data for direct marketing or promotions without the consent of the user and do not store any user location information that personally identifies the end user except to deliver and support our services. We are also required to comply with our customers' privacy and data securities policies.
Intellectual property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are available.
We seek to patent key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions. As of June 30, 2019, we held 163 U.S. patents and 155 foreign patents expiring between April 11, 2020 and April 27, 2036, and have 62 U.S. and 106 foreign patent applications pending. Of the pending 62 U.S. patent applications, 49 are nonprovisional utility patent applications. These patents and patent applications may relate to features and functions of our services and the technology platforms we use to provide them. We have filed, and will continue to file, patent applications in the United States and other countries where there exists a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. 
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
We also enter into various types of licensing agreements to obtain access to technology or data that we utilize in connection with our navigation services. Our contracts with certain licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of revenue derived from the number of paying end users. Our most important agreements are with the providers of maps pursuant to which we generally pay a monthly fee per end user or copy or a per transaction fee. We obtain map data from HERE North America, LLC, or HERE, pursuant to a master data license agreement dated December 1, 2002. HERE is principally owned by a consortium consisting of Audi AG, or Audi, BMW AG, or BMW, and Mercedes. Our agreement with HERE was automatically renewed under its existing terms through January 31, 2019, and automatically renews for successive one year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. In addition, we have entered into separate territory license agreements with HERE under which we are licensed to use certain map data for particular programs with certain of our current automotive customers to fulfill their requirements. The term of these territory licenses with HERE vary based on the customer and program, and can be extended for additional periods. Our agreement with HERE also allows a party to terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach. 
In addition, we obtain other data such as map, weather updates, gas prices, POI and traffic information from additional providers.
Competition
The markets for development, distribution and sale of location services are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do.
We compete in the automotive navigation market with established automobile manufacturers and tier ones and providers of on-board navigation services such as AISIN AW CO., Ltd, or AISIN, AutoNavi Software Co., Ltd., or AutoNavi, Robert Bosch GmbH, or Bosch, Elektrobit Corporation, or Elektrobit, Garmin Ltd., or Garmin, HERE, Navinfo Co., Ltd., or Navinfo, NNG LLC, or NNG, Shenyang MXNavi Co., Ltd., or MXNavi, and TomTom North America, Inc., or TomTom, as well as other competitors such as Apple and Google. 
Competition in our markets is based primarily on pricing and performance including features, functions, reliability, flexibility, scalability and interoperability; automobile manufacturer and tier one relationships; technological expertise, capabilities and innovation; price of services and products and total cost of ownership; brand recognition; and size and financial stability of operations. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors based upon the performance, reliability and breadth of our services and products and our technical experience.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, including with respect to the following:

• | significantly greater revenue and financial resources;


• | ownership of mapping and other content allowing them to offer a more vertically integrated solution;


• | stronger brand and consumer recognition in a particular market segment, geographic region or worldwide;


• | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;


• | access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios;


• | access to custom or proprietary content;


• | quicker pace of innovation;


• | stronger automobile manufacturer or tier one, advertising agency and advertiser relationships;


• | more financial flexibility and experience to make acquisitions;


• | lower labor and development costs; and


• | broader global distribution and presence.

Our competitors’ and potential competitors’ advantages over us could make it more difficult for us to sell our navigation services, and could result in increased pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or even the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely cause harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.
