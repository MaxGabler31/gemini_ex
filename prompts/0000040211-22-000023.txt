RAIL NORTH AMERICA
Rail North America is composed of our operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Rail North America primarily provides railcars pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars, pays ad valorem taxes and insurance, and provides other ancillary services. These railcars have estimated economic useful lives of 27 to 45 years and an average age of approximately 22 years. Rail North America has a large and diverse customer base, serving approximately 860 customers. In 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 4% of Rail North America’s total lease revenue, and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 22% of Rail North America’s total lease revenue. Rail North America leases railcars for terms that generally range from one to ten years, which vary based on railcar types and market conditions. The average remaining lease term of the North American fleet was approximately 34 months as of December 31, 2021. Rail North America’s primary competitors are Union Tank Car Company, Wells Fargo Rail, CIT Rail, and Trinity Industries Leasing Company. Rail North America competes primarily on the basis of availability of railcars, lease rate, maintenance capabilities, customer relationships, and engineering expertise. 
Rail North America purchases new railcars from a number of manufacturers, including Trinity Rail Group, LLC ("Trinity"), a subsidiary of Trinity Industries, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (“Greenbrier”) and its subsidiaries, National Steel Car Ltd., and Freightcar America. We also acquire railcars in the secondary market. In 2018, we amended a long-term supply agreement with Trinity to extend the term to December 2023, and we agreed to purchase 4,800 tank cars (1,200 per year) beginning in January 2020 and continuing through 2023. At December 31, 2021, 3,036 railcars have been ordered pursuant to the amended terms of the agreement, of which 2,280 railcars have been delivered.
In 2018, we entered into a multi-year railcar supply agreement with American Railcar Industries, Inc. ("ARI"), pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 7,650 newly built railcars. The order encompasses a mix of tank and freight cars to be delivered over a five-year period, beginning in April 2019 and ending in December 2023. ARI's railcar manufacturing business was acquired by a subsidiary of Greenbrier on July 26, 2019, and such subsidiary assumed all of ARI's obligations under our long-term supply agreement. As of December 31, 2021, 6,141 railcars have been ordered, of which 3,838 railcars have been delivered. The agreement included an option to order additional railcars subject to certain restrictions and, as of December 31, 2021, we still have the option to order 2,200 additional railcars during the remaining term of the agreement.
Rail North America also owns a fleet of locomotives, consisting of 539 four-axle and 29 six-axle locomotives as of December 31, 2021. Locomotive customers are primarily regional and short-line railroads, industrial users, and Class I railroads. Lease terms vary from month-to-month to ten years. As of December 31, 2021, the average remaining lease term of the locomotive fleet was approximately 25 months. Rail North America's primary competitors in locomotive leasing are Wells Fargo Rail, CIT Rail, and Progress Rail Services Corporation. Competitive factors in the market include availability of locomotives, lease rates, customer service, and maintenance. 
Rail North America also remarkets its rail assets, and these remarketing activities may generate gains which could contribute significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.
Maintenance
Rail North America operates an extensive network of maintenance facilities in the United States and Canada dedicated to performing safe, timely, efficient, and high-quality railcar maintenance services for customers. Services include interior cleaning of railcars, routine maintenance and general repairs to the car body and safety appliances, regulatory compliance work, wheelset replacements, interior blast and lining, exterior blast and painting, and car stenciling. To the extent possible, railcar maintenance is scheduled in a manner that minimizes the amount of time the car is out of service.
In order to increase the efficiency of our maintenance network, Rail North America sold three of its customer-dedicated sites and three mobile repair units in 2021. Subsequent to year-end, Rail North America has sold one additional customer-dedicated site. Railcar maintenance demand was not sufficient to consistently achieve adequate productivity from these locations. 
At December 31, 2021, Rail North America’s maintenance network consisted of: 
•Six major maintenance facilities that can complete nearly all types of maintenance services.
•Two smaller maintenance facilities with more limited capabilities. 
•Three customer-dedicated sites operating within customer facilities that offer services tailored to the needs of our customers’ fleets.
•Five locations with mobile units that travel to many track-side field locations to provide spot repairs and interior cleaning services.
    The maintenance network is supplemented by a number of preferred third-party maintenance providers and railroads. In 2021, third-party maintenance network expenses accounted for approximately 21% of Rail North America’s total maintenance network expenses, excluding repairs performed by the railroads. In 2021, wholly owned and third-party maintenance facilities performed approximately 42,700 service events, including multiple independent service events for the same car.
Our maintenance activities are dedicated to servicing our wholly owned railcar fleet pursuant to the provisions of our lease contracts. This may include services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement, such as repairs of railcar damage or other customer-specific requirements. Revenue earned from these types of maintenance services is recorded in other revenue. We may also perform maintenance and repair activities on cars owned by third parties.
Affiliates
GATX is a co-founder of, and owns a 17% share in the RailPulse LLC ("RailPulse") joint venture. GATX’s partners include Norfolk Southern Railway Company, Genesee & Wyoming Inc., Trinity Industries, Inc., Watco Companies, LLC, and Greenbrier Leasing, LLC. The RailPulse joint venture was formed to create an industry-wide telematics platform to enable the use of telematics devices to gather data and enhance rail safety and the value proposition for rail shippers across North America. As of December 31, 2021, RailPulse is preparing to launch its first service pilot, and has publicly stated its intention to enter regular service in 2023. The financial results of RailPulse are not currently material to GATX.
RAIL INTERNATIONAL
Rail International is composed of our operations in Europe ("GATX Rail Europe" or "GRE"), India ("GRI"), and Russia ("Rail Russia"). GRE primarily leases railcars to customers throughout Europe pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars and provides value-added services according to customer requirements. These railcars have estimated useful lives of 35 to 40 years and an average age of approximately 17 years. GRE has a diverse customer base with approximately 240 customers. In 2021, one customer accounted for approximately 12% of GRE's total lease revenue and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 50% of GRE's total lease revenue. GRE's lease terms generally range from one to ten years and as of December 31, 2021, the average remaining lease term of the European fleet was approximately 26 months. GRE's primary competitors are VTG Aktiengesellschaft, the Ermewa Group, Wascosa AG, and Touax. GRE competes principally on the basis of availability of railcars, customer relationships, lease rate, and maintenance expertise.
GRE acquires new railcars primarily from Gök Yapi San. Tic. a.s., Greenbrier-Astra Rail (Wagony Swidnica sp. z.o.o and Astra Rail Industries S.A.), Duro Dacovic, On Rail, and Tatravagonka a.s. Additionally, GRE's Ostróda, Poland maintenance facility assembles several hundred tank cars each year. As of December 31, 2021, GRE had commitments to acquire from third parties, primarily from Gök Yapi San. Tic. a.s., Duro Dacovic, Greenbrier-Astra Rail, and Tatravagonka Poprad, approximately 1,400 newly manufactured railcars to be delivered in 2022. The majority of these railcars have committed leases in place with customers.
As of December 31, 2021, GRI owned 4,830 railcars with estimated useful lives of 15 to 25 years. GRI's leases are net leases and have terms generally ranging from four to fourteen years. As of December 31, 2021, the average remaining lease term of the Indian fleet was approximately 5 years. GRI has a small customer base with twelve customers in the automotive, container, steel, cement, and bulk commodities transport sector, as well as one customer in the public sector. As of December 31, 2021, GRI had entered into contracts to acquire 548 railcars to be delivered in 2022, the majority of which have committed leases in place with customers.
As of December 31, 2021, Rail Russia owned 380 railcars with useful lives of 22 to 32 years. Rail Russia's leases have terms generally ranging from three to seven years. As of December 31, 2021, the average remaining lease term of the Russian fleet was approximately 3 years. Rail Russia has a small customer base with three customers in the timber, food products, and chemical sectors.
Maintenance
As of December 31, 2021, GRE operates a maintenance facility in Ostróda, Poland. This facility assembles railcars for GRE's fleet and performs significant repairs, regulatory compliance, and modernization work for our owned railcars. This facility is supplemented by a number of third-party repair facilities. The third party facilities accounted for approximately 69% of GRE's fleet repair costs in 2021.
Similar to our Rail North America segment, GRE's customers periodically require maintenance services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement. These services are generally related to the repair of railcar damage caused by customers and railways. Revenue earned from these maintenance activities is recorded in other revenue.
In India, all railcar maintenance is performed by Indian Railways or third-parties authorized by Indian Railways, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In Russia, all railcar maintenance is performed by third-party repair facilities either owned or authorized by Russian Railways, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Portfolio Management is composed primarily of our ownership in a group of joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc that lease aircraft spare engines, directly-owned aircraft spare engines and five liquefied gas-carrying vessels (the "Specialized Gas Vessels").
Investment Portfolio
 

Affiliates
The Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance joint ventures (collectively the “RRPF affiliates”) are a group of 50% owned domestic and foreign joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc (or affiliates thereof, collectively “Rolls-Royce”), a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft jet engines. The RRPF affiliates are primarily engaged in two business activities: leasing of aircraft spare engines to a diverse group of commercial aircraft operators worldwide and leasing of aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce for use in their engine maintenance programs. As of December 31, 2021, the RRPF affiliates, in aggregate, owned 407 engines, of which 199 were on lease to Rolls-Royce. Aircraft engines generally have an estimated economic useful life of 20 to 25 years when new and, depending on actual usage and with proper maintenance, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. As of December 31, 2021, the average age of these engines was approximately 12 years. Lease terms vary, but typically range from 3 to 12 years. Rolls-Royce acts as manager for each of the RRPF affiliates and also performs substantially all maintenance activities.
Owned and Managed Assets
As of December 31, 2021, Portfolio Management's owned assets consisted primarily of aircraft spare engines and the Specialized Gas Vessels.
In 2021, GATX began investing directly in aircraft spare engines through its new entity, GATX Engine Leasing ("GEL"). During 2021, GEL acquired 14 aircraft spare engines for approximately $352 million, including 4 engines for $120 million from the RRPF affiliates. GEL leases the aircraft spare engines to airline customers, and the engine lease administration is managed by the RRPF affiliates. Aircraft spare engines generally have an estimated economic useful life of 20 to 25 years when new and, depending on 
actual usage and with proper maintenance, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. As of December 31, 2021, the average age of these engines was approximately 2 years. Lease terms vary, but typically range from 10 to 12 years.
The Specialized Gas Vessels are commercially managed by Anthony Veder Group B.V. ("Veder"). Veder, based in the Netherlands, owns and operates a fleet of specialized gas-carrying vessels under contracts and charters with customers in the oil and gas industry. The Specialized Gas Vessels engage in the transport of pressurized gases and chemicals, such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, and ethylene, primarily on short- and medium-term contracts for major oil and chemical customers worldwide.
Portfolio Management also manages portfolios of assets for third parties which generate fee and residual sharing income through portfolio administration and the remarketing of these assets. As of December 31, 2021, Portfolio Management's managed activities consisted primarily of managing leases of two power generating assets.
OTHER
On December 29, 2020, GATX acquired Trifleet Leasing Holding B.V. ("Trifleet"), one of largest tank container lessors in the world, headquartered in Dordrecht, Netherlands.

Safety
GATX strives to maintain the highest levels of safety by fostering a culture that makes safety a top priority. GATX utilizes a continuous improvement methodology to identify safety risks and hazards and drive improvement initiatives. 
We continue to ensure that our railcar maintenance facility employees and inspectors who are essential workers in the rail industry can safely perform their jobs every day by screening, maintaining safe work practices, and executing robust cleaning practices within our repair facility network in order to minimize COVID-19 risk to our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate. We continue to manage actual and potential exposure to COVID-19 of our employees to minimize transmission and also offered vaccine incentives and benefits.
GATX continues to be recognized as a Responsible Care Partner by the American Chemistry Council and the Chemical Industry Association of Canada ("CIAC") and is an active participant in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response initiative, a national outreach effort assisting communities to prepare for and respond to possible hazardous materials transportation incidents. In 2020, GATX donated a tank car to the CIAC to provide tank car and service equipment training to emergency responders throughout Canada. Additionally, GATX offers training on the proper use of our equipment and on regulations that impact our business. We hold training events at customer locations across North America through the use of our TankTrainer™ mobile classroom. In the past four years, we have trained more than 1,600 customers and emergency responders.
Community Commitment
We believe that building connections between our employees and their communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. GATX has a long history of supporting causes in communities where our employees live and work, establishing a company culture that values strong corporate citizenship. Every year, we organize and encourage employees to volunteer and give back through programs that focus on addressing the needs of underserved populations and building vibrant communities. In 2021, through our partnership with Big Shoulders Fund, which provides support to inner-city schools in Chicago, employees engaged students during virtual service days and volunteered on site to clean and ready schools for the new school year. Further, GATX employees have mentored Big Shoulders students since 2016 and comprise the largest single group of mentors to the organization. We also know that our employees’ philanthropic interests and passions are as unique as our employees themselves. Therefore, to further support and encourage their individual efforts, in 2021 we implemented a “Do Good Day”, a paid day off for full-time corporate employees in North America to volunteer in their communities for a cause personally meaningful to them. Finally, we held our annual employee giving campaign and fundraiser for the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Illinois, and in 2021, we celebrated 25 years of partnership with Make-A-Wish and more than $5 million in total giving to the organization to help grant wishes.
Sustainability
Consistent with our vision, we are committed to growing our business in a sustainable and socially responsible manner, and we demonstrate our commitment through our programs and initiatives. Our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Committee, a multi-functional team, meets periodically to develop, assess, and prioritize ESG topics that are important to our business and our stakeholders and to continually improve both the measurement and transparency of our ESG disclosures and practices. The ESG Committee has primary management responsibility for our ongoing and developing ESG efforts. We maintain a Sustainability page on our website (www.gatx.com) to highlight our environmental and social responsibility accomplishments and provide key performance data to our stakeholders. In 2021, GATX issued its first Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") report, which discloses metrics related to relevant ESG factors. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws cover discharges to waters; air emissions; toxic substances; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous materials; and the investigation and remediation of contamination. These laws have the effect of increasing the cost and liability associated with leasing and operating assets, and violations can result in significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Environmental risks and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the use of rail and other transportation assets, which can involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
We are subject to, and may from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for investigation, cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, we have been and may, in the future, be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws or regulations for all or a portion of the costs to investigate and clean-up sites at which certain contaminants may have been discharged or released by us, our current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. Environmental remediation and other environmental costs are accrued when considered probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2021, environmental costs were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further discussion, see "Note 23.  Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
We recognize that climate change has the potential to impact our leasing business and maintenance operations. GATX continues to evaluate, quantify, and report on business, operational, and strategic risks associated with climate change. In 2021, GATX calculated and published 2019 and 2020 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for all our facilities globally and initiated an assessment of our full value chain impacts on the environment in an effort to identify opportunities to reduce those impacts.
