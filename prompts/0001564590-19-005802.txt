ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 Cadence Bancorporation is a financial holding company and a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, and is the parent company of Cadence Bank, National Association (“Cadence Bank”). Formed in 2009 by banking industry veterans, we secured $1.0 billion of capital commitments in 2010 and built our franchise on the foundation established from three successful acquisitions: Cadence Bank,  in March 2011, the franchise of Superior Bank in April 2011 and Encore Bank, N.A. in July 2012. Today, we are a growth-oriented, middle-market focused commercial relationship bank providing a broad range of banking and wealth management services to businesses, high net worth individuals, business owners and retail customers through a network of 66 branches as of December 31, 2018, with branches in Alabama, Florida, Texas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. We completed our initial public offering and listing on the NYSE in April 2017 with the ticker “CADE”.  As of December 31, 2018, we had $12.7 billion of assets, $10.1 billion of gross loans, $10.7 billion in deposits and $1.4 billion in shareholders’ equity. We generated $166.3 million and $102.4 million of net income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 On January 1, 2019, we completed our merger with State Bank Financial Corporation (“State Bank”), the holding company for State Bank and Trust Company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of State Bank Financial Corporation common stock was converted into 1.271 shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A common stock”). Total consideration paid was approximately $826 million consisting solely of the Class A common stock. With the acquisition of State Bank, we acquired 32 branches in Georgia. At December 31, 2018, State Bank had $4.9 billion of assets, $3.4 billion of gross loans, $4.1 billion in deposits, and $0.7 billion in shareholders’ equity as reported in their regulatory filings.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to build a premier commercial bank primarily through organically growing our client base, using mergers and acquisitions as an opportunistic complement to our strategy
. We focus on middle-market commercial lending (characterized as lending to businesses with annual revenues of $10 million to $500 million) and provide a broad range of banking services to businesses, high net worth individuals, business owners and retail customers. Through our experienced and motivated team of commercial relationship managers and our integrated, client-centric approach to banking, we have successfully grown our businesses. Our management team and experienced relationship managers have long-standing client relationships and operating experience in the markets we serve, and we believe these attributes will continue to position us to build market share. Further, we believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of (i) our attractive geographic footprint, (ii) our focus and ability to provide differentiated, personalized service to a wide variety of industries and clients, (iii) our stable and customer-driven deposit funding base, (iv) our veteran board of directors, management team and relationship managers, (v) our ability to realize economies of scale, (vi) our capital position and (vii) our credit quality and risk management processes.
Leverage our Relationships and Service Capabilities to Drive Organic Growth
 We have demonstrated robust loan growth in our markets, driven by our client relationships and client development efforts. We believe our loan growth has been a direct result of our people and our strategy, which focuses on a client-centered, service-oriented approach. Further, we believe our relationship managers’ entrepreneurial spirit, decision-making autonomy, flexibility and market expertise offers us unique growth opportunities not available to many of our peers. We intend to leverage the quality of our team, our existing relationships and our institutional approach to building tailored banking solutions to drive deeper relationships and increase penetration in our markets. Additionally, we are dedicated to investing in our team to ensure they continue to meet our high standard of excellence, while attracting and developing early career talent that embodies our entrepreneurial spirit and drives incremental relationships and loan growth.
Grow our Core Deposit Franchise
 The strength of our deposit franchise is derived from the long-standing relationships we have with our clients and the strong ties we have to the markets we serve. Our deposit footprint has provided, and we believe will continue to provide, primary support for our loan growth. Deposits comprise 96% of our total funding as of December 31, 2018. Our deposit growth and funding opportunities to support our loan growth come from our commercial and public-sector relationships, in addition to our retail deposit base. An additional part of our strategy is to continue to enhance our funding sources by expanding the ways in which we serve our customers, including ongoing optimization of our product offerings, treasury management services and client service capabilities, and increased adoption of mobile and digital platforms.

Prudently Invest in our Business to Drive Operating Leverage and Support our Risk Management Framework
 We believe it is critical to prudently invest in our business in order to provide the best possible customer experience and build a scalable infrastructure that can support our growth while driving operating leverage. We have a history of making successful investments, starting with the acquisition and integration of our three predecessor banks, and carried on through internal infrastructure investments, ongoing talent acquisition, investments in our management team, implementation of a consolidated technology platform and ongoing investments into optimization of our delivery channels. Our past investments have yielded significant benefits to our business, and we believe a focus on investing in our people, our technology and our processes will allow us to continue to support operational efficiencies.
Build our Fee-Based Business through New Business Initiatives and Existing Customer Relationships
 We have built a successful base of fee businesses—in both our Banking segment and our Financial Services segment—that provide complementary products and services to our core banking business. Each of our fee-based businesses is run by an experienced team and has infrastructure to support additional growth. We believe our integrated approach to our commercial relationships, along with our growing market position and the expertise and knowledge of our team, will provide ongoing new business opportunities.
Engage in Opportunistic Mergers and Acquisitions
 We prioritize organic growth but may evaluate from time to time acquisition opportunities that we believe could produce attractive returns for our shareholders. In particular, we may consider acquisition opportunities that could improve our market position in geographies with attractive demographics and business growth trends (including Texas and the southeast United States), expand our branch network in existing markets, reduce our ratio of loans to deposits, increase our earnings power and/or enhance our suite of products. We believe our acquisition and integration experience provides an advantage in identifying and executing on strategically and financially compelling opportunities that could supplement our organic growth strategy. We have been, and will continue to be, highly selective on acquisitions.
Products and Services
 Lending Activities
 Our primary strategic objective is to engage in commercial lending to middle-market customers (characterized as businesses with annual revenues of $10 million to $500 million) and provide a full array of commercial loans to middle-market commercial businesses, high net worth individuals and business owners. We believe we have a strong team of consumer and commercial bankers to execute on a client-centered, relationship-driven banking model. Our Commercial Banking team focuses on middle-market businesses with an advisory approach that emphasizes understanding the client’s business and offering a broad suite of loan, deposit and treasury management products and services. Within Commercial, our bankers focused on specialized industries have deep expertise and relationships in the sectors served, including the energy, franchise restaurant, healthcare and technology industries.
 Our consumer banking team consists of experienced professionals that focus on knowing their individual clients in order to best meet their financial needs, offering a full complement of loan, deposit and online banking solutions. Our consumer bankers do the vast majority of their new lending in the areas served by our branches, which are also where our marketing is focused.
 Our loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and other consumer loans. The principal risk associated with each category of loans we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the attributes of the borrower and the borrower’s market or industry. Attributes of the relevant business market or industry include the competitive environment, customer and supplier availability, the threat of substitutes and barriers to entry and exit.
 Commercial and Industrial Loans (“C&I”). As of December 31, 2018, $6.2 billion, or 62%, of our total bank loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans. Our C&I loans, which are generally made to middle-market businesses, include lines of credit, acquisition finance credit facilities and other types of commercial credit, and typically have maturities of five years or less. At December 31, 2018, an additional $266 million, or 2%, of our total bank loan portfolio consisted of loans to small businesses.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion, or 13%, of our bank loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. We offer construction financing, acquisition or refinancing of properties primarily located in our markets in Texas and the southeast United States. Other products that we provide include lines of credit and REIT facilities.
 4

Residential Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2018, $2.2 billion, or 22%, of our bank loan portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans. We provide one-to-four family residential real estate loans with terms ranging from 10 to 40 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. We do not originate subprime loans. Loans are typically closed-end first lien loans for purposes of purchasing property, or for refinancing existing loans with or without cash out. The majority of our loans are owner occupied, full documentation loans.
 Other Consumer Loans. As of December 31, 2018, $67 million, or 1%, of our bank loan portfolio consisted of other types of consumer loans. We offer consumer loans to our customers for personal, family and household purposes, including home equity, auto, boat and personal installment loans.
 Shared National Credits (“SNC”). At December 31, 2018, the federal banking agencies defined a SNC as any loan(s) extended to a borrower by a supervised institution or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates which aggregates $100 million or more and is shared by three or more institutions under a formal lending agreement or a portion of which is sold to two or more institutions, with the purchasing institutions assuming its pro rata share of the credit risk. As a commercial focused relationship bank, we often participate in syndicated loan offerings as a result of the size of the customers and nature of industries we serve. As of December 31, 2018, we have $2.6 billion of outstanding SNCs, representing 26% of our total loans outstanding.
 Our SNC loans are spread across our commercial products with many falling within our specialized industries, and are focused on customers where we have ancillary business, or believe we have the opportunity to develop such business. Our management team, relationship managers and credit risk management team have extensive experience in the underwriting, due diligence and monitoring of SNC credits. We evaluate SNC loans using the same credit standards we apply in underwriting all of our loans.
 SNC credit performance remains comparable to non-SNC credit performance. As of December 31, 2018, our SNC portfolio had $31 million of nonaccrual loans related to energy and restaurant lending. As of December 31, 2018, all of our SNC nonaccrual loans were current as to their contractual terms.
 Deposit Products and Other Funding Sources
 We offer our customers a variety of deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and other deposit accounts, through multiple channels, including our extensive network of full-service branches, drive-thru branches, ATMs, ITMs, and our online, mobile and telephone banking platforms. See “—Marketing and Distribution.” As of December 31, 2018, our deposit portfolio was comprised of 23% noninterest-bearing deposits and 77% interest bearing deposits. We intend to continue our efforts to provide funding for our business from customer relationship deposits.
 Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located in our footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets. In order to attract and retain deposits, we rely on providing quality service, offering a suite of retail and commercial products and services at competitive prices, and introducing new products and services that meet our customers’ needs as they evolve. 
 Wealth Management
 Through our Linscomb & Williams and Cadence Trust brands, we offer wealth management and other fiduciary and private banking services targeted to affluent clients, including individuals, business owners, families and professional service companies. In addition to fiduciary and investment management fee income, we believe these services enable us to build new relationships and expand existing relationships to grow our deposits and loans. Through our wealth management line of business, we offer financial planning, retirement services and trust and investment management by a team of seasoned advisors, providing access, for affluent clients as well as mass market clients, to a wide range of certificates of deposits, mutual funds, annuities, individual retirement accounts, money market accounts and other financial products. Although we do not limit our customers to affluent clients and business owners, the focus of our wealth management line of business is on the “mass affluent” ($500,000 to $2 million in investible assets) and “highly affluent” ($2 million to $5 million in investible assets) markets.
Insurance
 On May 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its subsidiary, Town & Country Insurance Agency, Inc. (“T&C”) to an unrelated third party. We sold $11.1 million in net assets, including $10.9 million in goodwill and intangibles. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.9 million recorded in noninterest income, offset by $1.1 million in sale related expenses recorded in noninterest expenses.

Under our Cadence Investment Services brand, we offer, directly and through licensed financial consultants, financial advisors and third-party partners a variety of personal insurance products to retail and commercial customers, including life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance, and buy-sell agreements. Our individual customers purchase our insurance products for income replacement, wealth transfer, estate planning and tax planning purposes. 
 Correspondent Banking
 In 2018, the Company began offering correspondent banking products to financial institutions, primarily in Texas with plans to expand to the Company’s broader footprint in 2019. Services include white-label treasury management services, liquidity management, Fed Funds accommodations, wholesale mortgage services and commercial real estate participations. 
Payroll Services
 In January 2019, we acquired substantially all the assets of Altera Payroll and Insurance (“Altera”) as part of the acquisition of State Bank. This acquisition will diversify our revenue beyond existing business lines and complements our other commercial banking services. Altera will operate as a subsidiary of Cadence Bank,, and in partnership with treasury management services, to provide payroll services, human resources services, payroll cards and employee health insurance. Altera may also provide employer liability insurance, and worker’s compensation through licensed insurance agents.
Financial Products and Services
 In addition to traditional banking activities and the other products and services specified above, we provide a broad array of financial services to our customers, including: debit and credit card products, treasury management services, merchant services, employee and payroll benefits solutions (including payroll cards and bank-at-work benefits) automated clearing house services, lock-box services remote deposit capture services, foreign exchange services,  and other treasury services.
Our Markets
 We define our markets broadly as Texas and the southeast United States. Our active banking operations are located principally in six states, which we refer to as our geographic footprint (our “footprint”), where we operate 66 branches as of December 31, 2018 throughout Texas, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee. As of December 31, 2018, State Bank operates 32 branches throughout Georgia. We focus on serving these regional markets, although we also serve specialized industries clients both within our geographic footprint and throughout the United States, as many of our clients in these industries have operations nationwide. 
 While we are focused on driving growth across all our markets and products, we believe our Texas presence will be the largest contributor to near term asset growth, followed by Georgia, with funding support from our deposit base in Texas and the southeast United States. 
 Technology Systems
 We continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our banking and lending and cash management activities. We believe this is necessary investment in order to offer new products and enhance our overall customer experiences, as well as to provide scale for future growth. Our technology investments include investment in the foundational layer of our infrastructure (including security, data and voice network, storage and disaster recovery).
 Additionally, our technology investments include investment in the application layer of our technology. We have built a robust technology core for the Treasury Management product suite, including “Allegro”, our single sign on portal for our business customers to access our Treasury Management products. Supported by this technology core, our Treasury Management product suite is competitive with small community banks as well as large regional and money center banks. Additionally, we operate the “Fluent by Cadence” platform, our online, mobile and other digital banking solution for consumer and small business banking. By leveraging the same platform as “Allegro”, we are able to centrally service and manage all digital banking activities and provide a seamless experience to our customers as they migrate from a small business to one that leverages our Treasury Management services. 
 We have also invested in video teller capabilities which enable our customers to interact with tellers outside of regular banking hours through interactive drive-throughs.

Credit Policy and Procedures
 General- Our credit policy requires that key risks be identified and measured, documented and mitigated, to the extent possible, to seek to ensure the soundness of our loan portfolio. We require various levels of internal approvals based on the characteristics of our loans, including the size of the exposure, the line of business and the loan type. We also have specialized underwriting guidelines for loans in our specialized industries that we believe reflect the unique characteristics of these industries. Our credit policy also provides guidelines for the underwriting of loans to individuals along with the regulatory requirements to ensure that all loan applications are evaluated subject to our fair lending policy. We believe that the guidelines required by our credit policies enhance internal responsibility and accountability for underwriting decisions and permit us to monitor the performance of credit decision-making.
 Credit Risk Management- Using our dual credit risk rating (“DCRR”) system, it is our policy to assign risk ratings to all commercial loan exposures using our internal credit risk rating system. The assignment of loan risk ratings is the primary responsibility of the lending officer concurrent with approval from the credit officer reviewing and recommending approval of the credit. The assignment of commercial risk ratings is done on a transactional basis using scorecards. We use a total of six different scorecards that accommodate various areas of lending. Each scorecard contains two main components: probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”). Each component is assessed using a multitude of both qualitative and quantitative scoring elements, which will generate a percentage for each component. The key elements assessed in the scorecard for PD are financial performance and trends as well as qualitative measures. The key elements for LGD are collateral quality and the structure of the loan. The PD percentage and LGD percentage are converted into PD and LGD risk ratings for each loan. The PD is used as our grade of record, while the LGD is utilized in both our allowance estimate as well as pricing model. Loans with PD ratings of 1 through 8 are loans that we rate internally as “Pass.” Loans with PD ratings of 9 through 13 are rated internally as “Criticized” and represent loans for which one or more potential or defined weaknesses exits.  Loans with PD ratings of 10 through 13 are also considered “Classified” and represent loans for which one or more defined weakness exists.  These classifications are consistent with regulatory guidelines. Consumer purpose loan risk classification is done in accordance with the Uniform Retail Credit Classification, based on delinquency and accrual status.
 Our credit risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors and our Senior Credit Risk Management Committee. Our Senior Credit Risk Management Committee has six standing members, including the Chief Executive Officers of Cadence Bancorporation and Cadence Bank, Cadence Bank’s President, our Chief Credit Administration Executive, who serves as chairman of the committee, our Enterprise Risk Management Executive, and our Chief Credit Underwriting Executive, who serves as vice chairman of the committee. The committee is responsible for reviewing our credit portfolio management information, including asset quality trends, concentration reports, policy, financial and documentation exceptions, delinquencies, charge-offs, and other nonperforming assets. The approval of the Senior Credit Risk Management Committee is required for changes to our credit policy as well as lending and wire authority.
 Concentration Limits- Our policies establish concentration limits for various industries within the commercial portfolio as well as commercial real estate, specialty lending, leveraged lending and other regulatory categories. Concentration limits are monitored and reassessed on a periodic basis and approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis.
 Credit Approval Process- The approval of our Senior Loan Committee is generally required for relationships in an amount greater than $5.0 million. The Senior Loan Committee has eight standing voting members, including the five members of the Senior Credit Risk Management Committee. Two “no” votes will result in declining a credit request.
 For loans in an amount greater than $5 million that are risk rated 10 or worse, approval of the Credit Transition Committee is generally required. The Credit Transition Committee has five standing members, including our Chief Credit Administration Executive, who serves as chairman of the committee and our Chief Credit Underwriting Executive, who serves as vice chairman. Two “no” votes will result in declining a credit application.  There is a credit executive assigned to each line of business who holds the primary responsibility for the approval process outside of the loan approval committees.
 Portfolio Monitoring & Reporting- We believe that an important part of our assessment of client risk is the ongoing completion of periodic risk rating reviews. As part of these reviews, we seek to review the risk rating of each facility within a customer relationship and may recommend an upgrade or downgrade to the risk rating. Our policy is to review two times per year all customer relationships with an aggregate exposure of $10 million or greater as well as all SNC’s. Additionally, all customer relationships with an aggregate exposure of $2.5 million to $10 million are reviewed annually. Further, customer relationships with an aggregate exposure of $500 thousand and greater with a criticized risk rating are reviewed quarterly. Certain relationships are exempt from review, including relationships where our exposure is cash-secured. An updated risk rating scorecard is required during each risk review as well as with any credit event that requires credit approval.

Marketing and Distribution
 As of December 31, 2018, we conduct our banking business through 66 branches located in Texas and five states in the southeast United States. As of December 31, 2018, State Bank operates 32 branches throughout Georgia. Our distribution network also includes ATMs, ITMs, fully integrated online banking and a telephone banking service. In addition, our customers have free access to Publix Presto! ATMs located throughout Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee and Allpoint ATMs worldwide. Our ATMs are enabled for several networks, including Visa, Discover, MasterCard, NYCE, Plus, Cirrus, Pulse, American Express and Quest.
 We target growing companies and middle-market businesses, as well as individual consumers throughout Texas and the southeast United States. In order to market our deposit products and financial services, we use local print advertising and direct mail and provide sales incentives for our employees. We market our lending products through our experienced relationship managers, who rely on robust calling efforts and relationship banking to develop relationships with customers that result in business growth and product sales. Our compensation plans for our relationship managers include incentives based on achievement of certain loan, deposit, fee, income and profitability metrics.
 Competition
 The financial services industry in general and in our markets in Texas and the southeast United States are highly competitive. We compete actively with national, regional and local financial services providers, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage bankers and finance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restrictions imposed upon us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We face significant competition to attract and retain customers and clients, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.”
 Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and non-traditional alternatives. The primary factors driving commercial and consumer competition for loans and deposits are the interest rates, the fees charged, the levels of customer service and the range of products and services offered. In addition, other competitive factors include the location and hours of our branches and ATMs.
 In addition to the terms of loans and deposits, we compete with other financial institutions with respect to the terms of swaps and letters of credit that we offer our customers and the fraud prevention products and other technological aspects of customers’ accounts that we provide, including compatibility with our commercial customers’ accounting systems. 
 Supervision and Regulation
 Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected, not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include, but are not limited to, the Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), various state banking regulators, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies and any changes to any of them can be significant and cannot be predicted.
 The primary goals of the bank regulatory structure are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In furtherance of those goals, the U.S. Congress and the individual states have created numerous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), that govern banks and the banking industry. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to the Company establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), our depositors and the public, rather than our shareholders and creditors.
 The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose additional supervisory obligations on banking organizations with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”), enacted into law May 24, 2018, modified a number of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Our total assets were $10.5 billion and Cadence Bank’s total assets were $10.5 billion as of September 30, 2017, the first quarter-end as of which total assets exceeded $10 billion. As a result, after September 30, 2018, which was the fourth consecutive quarter in which total average consolidated assets exceed $10 billion (and any applicable phase-in period), we and Cadence Bank are, among other requirements:
 
 
• | required to calculate our FDIC deposit insurance assessment using the large bank pricing rule;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8

 
• | subject to the restrictions on proprietary trading and investment in mutual or hedge funds under the Volcker Rule;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subject to more frequent regulatory examinations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | subject to examination for compliance with federal consumer protection laws by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, after June 30, 2018, Cadence and Cadence Bank became subject to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act regarding limits on debit card interchange fees. The Durbin Amendment gave the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more and to enforce a statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve has adopted rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge a merchant for a transaction to the sum of 21 cents and five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs. The ultimate impact of the heightened scrutiny to which we will be subject is uncertain but we may be adversely affected and may incur increased costs related to regulatory oversight.
 New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. The federal banking agencies have issued a number of significant new regulations as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and a number of additional regulations are pending or may be proposed as a result of the EGRRCPA. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which any of our businesses may be affected by any new regulation or statute.
 The following is an attempt to summarize some of the relevant laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies, but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing banks. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed.
 Bank Holding Company Regulation
 The Company is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”) and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Federal laws subject financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions, for violation of laws and policies.
Activities Closely Related to Banking
 The BHC Act prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company that is not a bank or from engaging in any activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other subsidiaries or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries. Bank holding companies also may engage in or acquire interests in companies that engage in a limited set of activities that are closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks.  
 If a company has elected to become a financial holding company (an “FHC”), it may engage in a broader set of activities, including insurance underwriting and broker-dealer services, as well as activities that are jointly determined by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. FHCs may also engage in activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve to be complementary to financial activities. To qualify as an FHC, the bank holding company and all subsidiary depository institutions must be well managed and well capitalized. Additionally, each subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company must have received at least a “Satisfactory” rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) examination. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in limitations on activities and acquisitions. 
 Safe and Sound Banking Practices
 Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate an activity or control of a non-bank subsidiary if such activity or control constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank and is inconsistent with sound banking principles. Regulation Y and capital rules also require a holding company to receive the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities.
 9

Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act codification of the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies must serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudence, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of distributions to shareholders unless its available net income has been sufficient to fully fund the distributions, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with a bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
 In addition, the Federal Reserve Supervisory Letter SR 09-4 provides guidance on the declaration and payment of dividends, capital redemptions and capital repurchases by a bank holding company. Supervisory Letter SR 09-4 provides that, as a general matter, a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if: (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
 Limitations on the Bank paying dividends could, in turn, affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. For more information concerning the Bank’s ability to pay dividends, see below.
 The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. Notably, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”) provides that the Federal Reserve can assess civil money penalties for such practices or violations which can be as high as $1 million per day. FIRREA contains expansive provisions regarding the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed.
 Annual Reporting and Examinations
 The Company is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries and charge the company for the cost of such an examination.
Volcker Rule
 Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the Volcker Rule, prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.” In December 2013, the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. After the enactment of the EGRRCPA in May 2018, Volcker Rule limitations apply to banking entities with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Under the Volcker Rule implementing regulations, banking entities have two years to conform its investments and implement the required compliance plan.
Regulatory Capital
 Cadence and Cadence Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. In 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the final Basel III Rules implementing the Basel III framework as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional
 Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to previously existing regulations. For more information, see the “Regulatory Capital” section of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Financial holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements. These requirements provide for a minimum of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated average tangible assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), called the “leverage ratio”, of 4.0% for all bank holding companies.

Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of non-traditional activities, as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family mortgages.
 As discussed above, in accordance with the law, each federal banking agency has specified, by regulation, the levels at which an insured institution would be considered well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded the capital levels required to be deemed well capitalized.
 Additionally, FDICIA requires bank regulators to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. 
 Under these prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, if a controlled bank is undercapitalized, then the regulators could require the bank to submit a capital restoration plan. If an institution becomes significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, additional and significant limitations are placed on the institution. The capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized institution will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes adequately capitalized. The Company has control of the bank for the purpose of this statute.
 Further, by statute and regulation, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each bank that it controls and, under appropriate circumstances, may be required to commit resources to support each such controlled bank. This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support. In addition, if the Federal Reserve believes that a bank holding company’s activities, assets or affiliates represent a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a controlled bank, then the Federal Reserve could require the bank holding company to terminate the activities, liquidate the assets or divest the affiliates. The regulators may require these and other actions in support of controlled banks even if such actions are not in the best interests of the bank holding company or its shareholders.
 Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies
 The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (1) acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company, (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (3) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy. As a result of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which is discussed below, the Federal Reserve is required to consider the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary bank(s) in combating money laundering activities in its evaluation of bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also amended the BHC Act to require consideration of the extent to which a proposed acquisition, merger or consolidation would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.
Control Acquisitions
 Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company, such as the Company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person or entity acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and that person or entity, by such acquisition, becomes the single largest holder of that class of voting securities.
 11

Interstate Acquisitions
 Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. The Dodd-Frank Act permits a national or state bank, with the approval of its regulator, to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state. National banks may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.
Anti-tying Restrictions
 Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates.
Bank Regulation
 Cadence Bank
 Cadence Bank is a national banking association, which is subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the OCC and secondarily by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Cadence Bank is subject to requirements and restrictions under federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank.
 The OCC regularly examines the Bank. The FDIC may also periodically examine and evaluate insured banks.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness
 As part of FDICIA’s efforts to promote the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies, the federal banking regulators are required to have in place regulations specifying operational and management standards (addressing internal controls, loan documentation, credit underwriting and interest rate risk), asset quality and earnings. As discussed above, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC have extensive authority to police unsafe or unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by depository institutions and their holding companies. For example, the FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that it determines has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. The agencies can also assess civil money penalties of up to $1 million per day, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, seek injunctions and publicly disclose such actions.
 The OCC also has restrictions on the payment of dividends by national banks. Cadence Bank may not, without the prior approval of the OCC, declare a dividend if the total amount of dividends declared by it in the current year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds certain levels of net and retained income. In addition, under the National Bank Act, Cadence Bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its “undivided profits.” See below for additional discussion regarding the Bank’s ability to pay dividends.
 The present and future dividend policy of Cadence Bank is subject to the discretion of its board of directors. In determining whether to pay dividends to the Company and, if made, the amount of the dividends, the board of directors of Cadence Bank considers many of the same factors discussed above. Cadence Bank cannot guarantee that it will have the financial ability to pay dividends to the Company, or if dividends are paid, that they will be sufficient for Cadence to make distributions to shareholders. Cadence Bank is not obligated to pay dividends.
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
 Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative limits on transactions between a bank and any affiliate and requires certain levels of collateral for extensions of credit to affiliates and certain other transactions involving affiliates. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company. Section 23B requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies. In the absence of such comparable transactions, any transaction between the banks and their affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, which in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
 12

Capital Adequacy
 In addition to the capital rules applicable to both banks and bank holding companies discussed above, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the federal bank regulators are required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks. For this purpose, a bank is placed in one of five categories based on the bank’s capital (as of the new capital rules discussed above): well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Currently, the quantitative requirements for the categories are:

• | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 6.5% common equity Tier 1 capital, 8% Tier 1 capital and 10% total capital);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital, 6% Tier 1 capital and 8% total capital);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital, 6% Tier 1 capital and 8% total capital);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 3% common equity Tier 1 capital, 4% Tier 1 capital and 6% total capital); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, banking regulators must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized.” The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. An institution that is categorized as “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized” is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency, which, for the Bank, is the OCC.
 Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits and other restrictions on our business.
 Deposit Insurance
 The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor, through the DIF and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. 
 Cadence Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on an assessment rate established by the FDIC. FDIC assessment rates for large institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as Cadence Bank, are calculated on a scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs. Cadence Bank became subject to the scorecard methodology in the third quarter of 2018. The FDIC has the authority to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard.  For large institutions, including Cadence Bank, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 3 basis points to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of the potential base rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 basis points to 40 basis points on an annualized basis. The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated based upon the average of total assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, less allowable deductions.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act establishes a minimum ratio of the DIF to estimated insured deposits of 1.15% prior to September 30, 2020 and 1.35% thereafter. Additionally, beginning July 1, 2016, the FDIC imposed a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as Cadence Bank (the surcharge only applied to Cadence Bank for the quarter ended September 30, 2018). The surcharge applied until the DIF first reaches or exceeds 1.35%, which occurred at September 30, 2018 and thus, the surcharge no longer applies. 
 In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments, which are included in Deposit Insurance Premiums on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, will continue until the remaining FICO bonds mature in 2019.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. As noted above, the Company and Cadence Bank exceeded $10 billion in total consolidated assets for four consecutive quarters as of September 30, 2018 and are now subject to examination by the CFPB.
 The CFPB has issued a number of regulations related to the origination of mortgages, foreclosures, and overdrafts as well as many other consumer issues. Additionally, the CFPB has proposed, or will be proposing, additional regulations or modifying existing regulations that directly relate to our business. Although it is difficult to predict at this time the extent to which the CFPB’s final rules impact the operations and financial condition of the bank, such rules may have a material impact on the bank’s compliance costs, compliance risk and fee income.
 Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity
 Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions’ own products and services. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers.
 The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack. The Cadence Information Security Program reflects the requirements of this guidance.
 PATRIOT Act, International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act and Bank Secrecy Act
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The PATRIOT Act and the International Money Laundering and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money-laundering laws and penalties, specifically related to the Bank Secrecy Act, and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the PATRIOT Act to financial institutions such as Cadence Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers.
 Failure of a financial institution and its holding company to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution. Because of the significance of regulatory emphasis on these requirements, Cadence Bank will continue to expend significant staffing, technology and financial resources to maintain programs designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and an effective audit function for testing of the banks’ compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act on an ongoing basis.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the OCC evaluates the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The performance of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its community is a factor that must be taken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as branch openings and relocations. Additionally, financial institutions must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA-related agreements.
 14

Failure to adequately meet the credit needs of our community in accordance with the CRA could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Any CRA rating below “Satisfactory” for the Bank could restrict the Company’s ability to undertake certain activities, including any merger or acquisition that our management and board of directors may otherwise desire to pursue, and may prevent or materially delay the consummation of future mergers or acquisitions or the opening of new branch locations, until the Bank’s rating improves. In addition, as described above, an FHC faces limitations on activities and acquisitions if its subsidiary depository institutions do not have at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating.
 Other Regulations
 Interest and other charges that the Bank collects or contracts for are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s loan operations also are subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the rules and regulations of the various governmental agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Bank’s deposit operations are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services.
 Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations
 The Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulatory agencies promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and increasing capital requirements.
 Compliance with the above laws and regulations add significantly to the cost of operating the Company and the Bank and thus have a negative impact on profitability. We would also note that there has been a tremendous expansion experienced in recent years by certain financial service providers that are not subject to the same rules and regulations as the Company and the Bank. These institutions, because they are not so highly regulated, have a competitive advantage over us and the Bank and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general.
 Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by both U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of fiscal and monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign branches, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates, and the placing of limits on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits. Such policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and our earnings.
