Item 1. Business. 
Dycom Industries, Inc. (“Dycom”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) is a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States. Since our incorporation in the State of Florida in 1969, we have expanded our scope and service offerings organically and through acquisitions. Our geographic presence and substantial workforce provide the scale needed to quickly execute on opportunities to service existing and new customers. Our consolidated contract revenues for fiscal 2022 were $3.1 billion.
We supply telecommunications providers with a comprehensive portfolio of specialty services, including program management; planning; engineering and design; aerial, underground, and wireless construction; maintenance; and fulfillment services for telecommunications providers. Additionally, we provide underground facility locating services for various utilities, including telecommunications providers, and other construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities. We supply the labor, tools, and equipment necessary to provide these services to our customers.
Engineering Services. We provide engineering services to telecommunications providers, including the planning and design of aerial, underground, and buried fiber optic, copper, and coaxial cable systems that extend from the telephone company hub location, or cable operator headend, to the consumer’s home or business. We also plan and design wireless networks in connection with the deployment of new and enhanced macro cell and new small cell sites. Additionally, we obtain rights of way and permits in support of our engineering activities and those of our customers as well as provide program and project management and inspection personnel in conjunction with engineering services or on a stand-alone basis.
Construction, Maintenance, and Installation Services. We also provide a range of construction, maintenance, and installation services, including the placement and splicing of fiber, copper, and coaxial cables. We excavate trenches in which to place these cables; place related structures, such as poles, anchors, conduits, manholes, cabinets, and closures; place drop lines from main distribution lines to the consumer’s home or business; and maintain and remove these facilities. We provide these services for both telephone companies and cable multiple system operators in connection with the deployment, expansion, or maintenance of new and existing networks. We also provide tower construction, lines and antenna installation, foundation and equipment pad construction, and small cell site placement for wireless carriers, as well as equipment installation and material fabrication and site testing services. For cable multiple system operators, we install and maintain customer premise equipment such as digital video recorders, set top boxes and modems. We also perform construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities and other customers. In addition, we provide underground facility locating services for a variety of utility companies, including telecommunications providers. Our underground facility locating services include locating telephone, cable television, power, water, sewer, and gas lines.
Business Strategy 
Capitalize on Long-Term Growth Drivers. We are well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for network bandwidth that is necessary to ensure reliable video, voice, and data services. Developments in consumer and business applications within the telecommunications industry, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase demand for greater wireline and wireless network capacity and reliability. Telecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Additionally, wireless carriers are upgrading their networks and contemplating next generation mobile solutions in response to the significant demand for wireless broadband, driven by the proliferation of smart phones, mobile data devices and other advances in technology. Increasing wireless data traffic and emerging wireless technologies are driving significant incremental wireline deployments in many 
Table of Contents

regions of the United States. Furthermore, significant consolidation and merger activity among telecommunications providers can also provide increased demand for our services as networks are integrated.
Selectively Increase Market Share. We believe our reputation for providing high quality services and the ability to provide those services nationally creates opportunities to expand market share. Our decentralized operating structure and multiple points of contact within customer organizations positions us favorably to win new opportunities and maintain strong relationships with existing customers. We are able to address larger customer opportunities due to our significant financial resources that some of our comparatively more capital-constrained competitors may be unable to take on. We do not intend to increase market share by pursuing unprofitable work.
Pursue Disciplined Financial and Operating Strategies. We manage the financial aspects of our business by centralizing certain activities that allow us to leverage our scope and scale and reduce costs. We have centralized functions such as information technology, risk management, treasury, tax, the approval of capital equipment procurements, and the design and administration of employee benefit plans. In contrast, we decentralize the recording of transactions and the financial reporting necessary for timely operational decisions. Decentralization promotes greater accountability for business outcomes by our local managers. Our local managers are responsible for marketing, field operations, and ongoing customer service, and are empowered to capture new business and execute contracts on a timely and cost-effective basis. Executive management supports the local marketing efforts while also marketing at a national level. This operating approach enables us to benefit from our scale while retaining the organizational agility necessary to compete with smaller, regional and privately owned competitors. 
Pursue Selective Acquisitions. We pursue acquisitions that are operationally and financially beneficial for the Company as they provide incremental revenue, geographic diversification, and complement existing operations. We generally target companies for acquisition that have defensible leadership positions in their market niches, profitability that meets or exceeds industry averages, proven operating histories, sound management and certain clearly identifiable cost synergies.
Fiscal Year
In September 2017, our Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from the last Saturday in July to the last Saturday in January. The change better aligned our fiscal year with the planning cycles of our customers. For quarterly comparisons, there were no changes to the months in each fiscal quarter. We use a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in January. Fiscal 2022, fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2017 each consisted of 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2021 consisted of 53 weeks of operations.
We refer to the period beginning January 31, 2021 and ending on January 29, 2022 as “fiscal 2022”, the period beginning January 26, 2020 and ending on January 30, 2021 as “fiscal 2021”, the period beginning on January 27, 2019 and ending on January 25, 2020 as “fiscal 2020”, the period beginning on January 28, 2018 and ending January 26, 2019 as “fiscal 2019”, the period beginning July 30, 2017 and ending January 27, 2018 as the “2018 transition period”, and the period beginning July 31, 2016 and ending July 29, 2017 as “fiscal 2017”.
Customer Relationships
We have established relationships with many leading telecommunications providers, including telephone companies, cable multiple system operators, wireless carriers, telecommunication equipment and infrastructure providers, as well as electric and gas utilities. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, accounting for approximately 66.2%, 74.1%, and 78.4%, of our total contract revenues, respectively. During fiscal 2022, we derived approximately 23.5% of our total contract revenues from AT&T Inc., 15.1% from Comcast Corporation, 11.9% from Lumen Technologies Inc. (formerly CenturyLink Inc.), 11.3% from Verizon Communications, Inc., and 4.4% from Frontier Communications Corporation. We believe that a substantial portion of our total contract revenues and operating income will continue to be generated from a concentrated group of customers.
We serve our markets locally through dedicated and experienced personnel. Our sales and marketing efforts are the responsibility of the management teams of our subsidiaries. These teams possess intimate knowledge of their particular markets, allowing us to be responsive to customer needs. Executive management supports these efforts, both at the local and national levels, focusing on contacts with the appropriate managers within our customers’ organizations.
We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other contracts that contain customer-specified service requirements. These agreements include discrete pricing for individual tasks. We generally possess multiple agreements with each of our significant customers. To the extent that such agreements specify exclusivity, there are often exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, the 
Table of Contents

performance of work with the customer’s own employees, and the use of other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In many cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience. Historically, multi-year master service agreements have been awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process; however, occasionally we are able to negotiate extensions to these agreements. We provide the remainder of our services pursuant to contracts for specific projects. These contracts may be long-term (with terms greater than one year) or short-term (with terms less than one year) and often include customary retainage provisions under which the customer may withhold 5% to 10% of the invoiced amounts pending project completion and closeout.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
The cyclical nature of the industry we serve affects demand for our services. The capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers, and the related timing of approvals and seasonal spending patterns, influence our contract revenues and results of operations. Factors affecting our customers and their capital expenditure budgets include, but are not limited to, overall economic conditions, the introduction of new technologies, our customers’ debt levels and capital structures, our customers’ financial performance, and our customers’ positioning and strategic plans, and any potential effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. Other factors that may affect our customers and their capital expenditure budgets include new regulations or regulatory actions impacting our customers’ businesses, merger or acquisition activity involving our customers, and the physical maintenance needs of our customers’ infrastructure.
Our contract revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality and are impacted by significant weather changes as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. Additionally, extreme weather conditions or environmental conditions, such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tropical storms, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, could also impact the demand for our services, or impact our ability to perform our services. Also, a disproportionate number of holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays in this fiscal quarter. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability or losses during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to the fiscal quarters ending in July and October.
Backlog

Our backlog is an estimate of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual agreements with our customers and totaled $5.822 billion and $6.810 billion at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively. We expect to complete 52.8% of the January 29, 2022 total backlog during the next 12 months. Our backlog represents an estimate of services to be performed pursuant to master service agreements and other contractual agreements over the terms of those contracts. These estimates are based on contract terms and evaluations regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is estimated based on the work performed in the preceding 12 month period, when applicable. When estimating backlog for newly initiated master service agreements and other long and short-term contracts, we also consider the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer during the procurement process and, where applicable, other ancillary information. A significant majority of our backlog comprises services under master service agreements and other long-term contracts.
 In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Contract revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations or changes in the amount of work we expect to be performed. In addition, contract revenues reflected in our backlog may be realized in different periods from those previously reported due to these factors as well as project accelerations or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in customer spending priorities, scheduling changes, commercial issues, such as permitting, engineering revisions, job site conditions and adverse weather, and the potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Many of our contracts may be cancelled by our customers, or work previously awarded to us pursuant to these contracts may be cancelled, regardless of whether or not we are in default. The amount of backlog related to uncompleted projects in which a provision for estimated losses was recorded is not material.
Backlog is not a measure defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, GAAP results. Participants in our industry often disclose a calculation of their backlog; however, our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. We utilize our calculation of backlog to assist in measuring aggregate awards under existing contractual relationships with our 
Table of Contents

customers. We believe our backlog disclosures will assist investors in better understanding this estimate of the services to be performed pursuant to awards by our customers under existing contractual relationships.
Competition
The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly fragmented and includes a large number of participants. We compete with several large multinational corporations and numerous regional and privately owned companies. In addition, a portion of our customers directly perform many of the same services that we provide. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. As a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and the necessary equipment may become a competitor and the degree to which an existing competitor participates in the markets that we operate may increase rapidly. The principal competitive factors for our services include geographic presence, quality of service, worker and general public safety, price, breadth of service offerings, and industry reputation. We believe that we compare favorably to our competitors when evaluated against these factors.
Human Capital Resources
We believe the people who work for our company are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We employed approximately 15,024 persons as of January 29, 2022. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits, and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
Each employee, officer and director of the Company must adhere to the highest standards of business ethics when dealing with each other and with customers, suppliers and all other persons as outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers (collectively, the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct requires all employees to conduct all business dealings with honesty and candor and with respect for the law and the highest standard of ethical behavior. Personal integrity, good faith and fair dealing, the respectful treatment of others, and all other attributes of good behavior are essential for employees, but special responsibility to uphold these values rests on our officers, managers and supervisors as they establish the climate for all other employees. Officers, managers and supervisors are required to create a work environment that encourages employees to discuss concerns without fear of retaliation. Should potential violations of the Code of Conduct or the law occur, employees are encouraged to voice concerns promptly and are reminded that retaliation against anyone who reports a potential violation in good faith will not be tolerated. All employees are required to complete the training on the Code of Conduct and Ethics, and we report material matters related to the Code of Conduct to the Audit Committee of our Board.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the safety and well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operational changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees. This includes having many of our office-based personnel work from home, while implementing and ensuring compliance with additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
Our Board of Directors, through our Compensation Committee and our Corporate Governance Committee, provides oversight on employee matters. The Compensation Committee receives updates on activities, strategies and initiatives related to our employees, and our Corporate Governance Committee oversees the development and succession planning of senior management. As part of this oversight, the Board received regular updates on efforts we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Independent Subcontractors and Materials
We contract with independent subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and to reduce the amount we expend on fixed assets and working capital. These independent subcontractors are typically small, privately owned companies that provide their own employees, vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. No individual independent subcontractor is significant to the Company.
For a majority of the contract services we perform, we are provided the required materials by our customers. Because our customers retain the financial and performance risk associated with materials they provide, we do not include the costs associated with these materials in our contract revenues or costs of earned revenues. Under contracts that require us to supply part or all of the required materials, we typically do not depend upon any one source for those materials.

Safety and Risk Management
We are committed to instilling safe work habits through proper training and supervision of our employees and expect adherence to safety practices that ensure a safe work environment. Our subsidiaries’ safety programs require employees to participate both in safety training required by law and training that is specifically relevant to the work they perform. Safety directors review incidents, examine trends, and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues.
Claims arising in our business generally include workers’ compensation claims, various general liability and damage claims, and claims related to motor vehicle collisions, including personal injury and property damage. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers’ compensation, and employee group health. Additionally, within our aggregate coverage limits and above our base layer of third-party insurance coverage, we have retained the risk of loss at certain levels of exposure. We carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers and our third-party claims administrator in determining claims estimates and adjustments. We accrue the estimated costs of claims as liabilities, and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Due to fluctuations in our loss experience from year to year, insurance accruals have varied and can affect our operating margins. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we experience an increase of insurance claims at certain amounts, or in excess of our coverage limits. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 10, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, and local government regulations, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, work-place safety, and other business requirements.
Environmental. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or if we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or cause other environmental damages. In addition, failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, loss of use, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions.
Workplace Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. Our failure to comply with OSHA or other workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities, fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions and affect our ability to perform the services that we have been contracted to provide to our customers.
Business. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses.
