Item 1. Business.



This business description should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “Form 10-K”), which are incorporated herein by this reference.



The use of the words “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Ondas Holdings” in this Form 10-K refer to Ondas Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries. 



Corporate Overview 



Ondas Holdings Inc. is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its wholly owned subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc. (“Ondas Networks”) and American Robotics, Inc. (“American Robotics” or “AR”). Ondas Networks and American Robotics together provide users in rail, energy, mining, agriculture, and critical infrastructure markets with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and automated decision-making to improve operations. We operate our two subsidiaries as separate business segments. See Notes 1 and 2 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments.
Ondas Networks 



Ondas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and ensure a high degree of safety and security.



We design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16s standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we have taken a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.



Our software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.



American Robotics



American Robotics designs, develops and manufactures autonomous drone systems, providing high-fidelity, ultra-high-resolution aerial data to enterprise customers. We provide our customers turnkey data solutions designed to meet their unique requirements in the field. We do this via our internally developed Scout System™, an industrial drone platform which provides commercial and government customers with the ability to continuously digitize, analyze, and monitor their assets and field operations in near real-time.



The Scout System™ has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the real world. Powered by innovations in robotics automation, machine vision, edge computing, and AI, the Scout System™ provides efficiencies as a drone solution for commercial use. Once installed in the field at customer locations, a fleet of connected Scout Systems remain indefinitely in an area of operation, automatically collecting data each day, self-charging, and seamlessly delivering data analysis regularly and reliably. AR markets the Scout System™ under a Robot-as-a-Service (“RaaS”) business model, whereby our drone platform aggregates customer data and provides the data analytics meeting customer requirements in return for an annual subscription fee.

The Scout System™ consists of (i) Scout™, a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads (ii) the ScoutBaseTM, a ruggedized weatherproof base station for housing, charging, data processing, and cloud transfer, and (iii) ScoutViewTM, a secure web portal and API which enables remote interaction with the system, data, and resulting analytics anywhere in the world. These major subsystems are connected via a host of supporting technologies. Using a suite of proprietary technologies, including Detect-and-Avoid (“DAA”) and other proprietary intelligent safety systems, we achieved the first and only Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) approval for automated operations without a human on-site in the United States on January 15, 2021. As a result, American Robotics currently has the unique ability to serve markets which require automated drone technology to enable scalable drone operations, which the Company estimates to be 90% of all commercial drone applications.



Partnership with Siemens



In April 2020, Ondas Networks entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”), a worldwide leader in seamless, sustainable, reliable and secure transportation solutions for more than 160 years, to both market our FullMAX-based networking technology and services and to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform.



We believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance across the global rail market beginning with the North American Class I Railroad market. In the third quarter of 2021 we completed the development of our first jointly-developed product with Siemens – the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems. Siemens is now marketing and selling these proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS radio systems support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens’ customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve safety. In addition, Siemens has begun to market and sell Ondas Networks’ standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under the Siemens Airlink brand.



Our relationship with Siemens expanded significantly in 2021 both with (i) the wider marketing of our wireless technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has expanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products with identified opportunities in North American Transit Rail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology has broad potential in these large, newly targeted markets. Siemens and Ondas Networks began a second major joint development program in the first quarter of 2021 to deliver a new dual mode on-board locomotive radio combining FullMAX MC-IoT technology with Siemens’ Head-of-Train (“HOT”) system. This new development, initially focused on the North American Class 1 rail market, has now expanded to global markets including for the delivery of a dual mode MC-IoT/HOT radio to a major Asian rail customer. Additional joint-product development projects are expected in 2022 and beyond.



Our Strategy



Our goal is to be a global leader in providing turnkey data solutions for industrial, public safety and government markets by offering i) secure wireless connectivity solutions enabling high-bandwidth, mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services through Ondas Networks and ii) automated industrial data services through American Robotics’ Scout System™.



The key elements of our growth strategy include the following:




● | Deliver multiple North American Class I Railroad network opportunities through our FullMAX platform. Our marketing and business development efforts combined with our exclusive strategic partnership with Siemens has generated the potential for significant sales in our targeted end markets. We expect large-scale commercial adoption of our network technology by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators in the newly awarded 900 MHz frequency band. Furthermore, Siemens has begun marketing and selling the new, jointly developed ATCS/MC-IoT radio platform which operates in the 900 MHz frequency and replaces a legacy ATCS platform. We received an initial purchase for commercial deployment in December 2021 from Siemens and are now working with our railroad customers to develop a commercial deployment strategy which we expect will significantly increase purchase orders for equipment and services in 2022 and subsequent years. In addition, together with Siemens, we are marketing our FullMAX platform as an upgrade for both the 450 MHz HOT network and the legacy 160 MHz voice-centric networks owned and operated by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators.

● | Secure and service “Franchise Customers” for our Scout System™. We focus the marketing of our Scout System™ on engagements with blue-chip industrial customers with emerging and substantial Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) programs. These “Franchise Customers” have the potential to move from initial field trials consisting of one to five systems to fleet deployments consisting of hundreds or even thousands of Scout Systems. Our focus for 2022 is on growing the number of Franchise Customer field engagements and successfully securing additional orders for fleet deployments from those customers. 
● | Continue to enhance the value of our Scout System™. We plan to develop and integrate additional payload capabilities to expand the number of high-value applications we can address for our customers. These new capabilities greatly expand the number of applications for which our customers can utilize our services, and thus expand the value the Scout System provides our customers. In addition, we intend to continue to develop proprietary data analytics utilizing artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision techniques. We believe continuous enhancements to our Scout System™ via increased diversity of payloads and more robust analytics capability will serve to increase the value of our drone-driven data solutions to customers and lead to larger and faster deployments with customers. 
● | Expand our MC-IoT capabilities via partnerships, joint ventures, or acquisitions. In addition to internal investment and development, we will actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our product offerings and solutions for our critical infrastructure customers via joint ventures, partnerships, and acquisitions. We intend to focus on companies with complementary technologies or product offerings or synergistic distribution strategies. 

Our Business Model



Ondas Networks 



We sell our FullMAX MC-IoT wireless products and services globally through a direct sales force and value-added sales partners to industrial and critical infrastructure providers including major rail operators, commercial and industrial drone operators, electric and gas utilities, water and wastewater utilities, oil and gas producers and pipeline operators, and for other critical infrastructure applications in areas such as public safety, homeland security and defense, and transportation. We continue to develop our value-added reseller relationships which today include a strategic partnership with Siemens for the development of new types of wireless connectivity for the North American Rail. We believe our Siemens’ partnership is indicative of the potential for additional Tier 1 partnerships in our other vertical markets including securing reseller relationships with major suppliers to the worldwide government and homeland security markets.



In executing our go-to-market strategy, we intend to monetize our software-based intellectual property and grow revenue and cash flow with embedded FullMAX software sales, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) arrangements, IP royalties based on Ondas Networks software and through additional services provided to customers and ecosystem partners. Customers deploy our connectivity and Fog-computing platform in private networks that designed for lifetimes of 10 – 15 years or even longer. Our FullMAX platform is software-defined and offers customers flexibility to expand capacity and evolve network utilization. Similarly, our ecosystem partners often integrate our FullMAX software and wireless capability into their own long-lived equipment and systems which their customers purchase and deploy. As such, we believe our software solutions provide ongoing revenue opportunities and sales models both related to both connectivity value and edge computing capability. Customers and ecosystem partners will require ongoing FullMAX system and security enhancements and for us to design additional features which create opportunities for additional, recurring revenue and profit streams. Our monetization strategies include:



Systems sales: Our FullMAX deployments are typically large, mission-critical wide-area networks deployed and privately operated by our industrial and government customers. These end-to-end system deployments involve sales consisting of both base stations and edge radio end points with embedded FullMAX software and network management software and tools.



Software and hardware maintenance agreements: Our customers contract with us for extended software and hardware maintenance which provide them with critical ongoing support for their installed network. These SaaS contracts provide revenue to us in the year following an initial installation. Software maintenance licenses entitle the customer to ongoing software and security upgrades as well as enabling the provision of additional system features. Similarly, hardware maintenance programs provide customers extended equipment warranty terms for an installed network. These SaaS maintenance arrangements allow our customers to continue to maintain a modern, flexible and upgradeable network over a long period of time. These agreements may extend for multiple years given the long average life of the installed and growing network.





3






Licensing / Royalties: In certain system deployments, our ecosystem partners will choose to embed FullMAX software into their own hardware and software platforms providing us with an ongoing per device multi-year revenue stream. Licensing is an effective way for an ecosystem partner to jumpstart customer activity. Alternatively, a partner may choose to develop software based on our intellectual property generating royalty revenue.



Other Services: We provide ancillary services directly related to the sale of our wireless communications products which include wireless network design, systems engineering, radio frequency planning, software configuration, product training, installation, and onsite support. Furthermore, we also provide engineering and product development services to ecosystem partners who are interested in integrating their intelligent equipment with our FullMAX SDR platform and need our expertise to do so.



American Robotics



American Robotics markets its Scout System™ drone platform via a direct sales force to industrial, agricultural and government customers. We focus on identifying and qualifying large, sophisticated customers with active drone programs who have the ability and intent to expand those programs and eventually deploy fleets of automated drones across their portfolio of assets. After initial customer qualification, contracting and the receipt of a purchase order, we ship and install the Scout System™ on the customer premises. Our field service personnel remain on location for a short period of time to ensure the programmed automated drone operations are meeting customer requirements.



By virtue of offering a truly automated data solution, American Robotics is able to structure its business under a Robot-as-a-Service (“RaaS”) model. The RaaS model bundles hardware, software, operations, and maintenance into one annual subscription fee. This business model results in a lower annual cost of data acquisition to a customer via the drone, to what AR believes is approximately ten times less than current manual methods which are labor intensive. Our RaaS business model also provides enhanced accuracy, consistency and completeness over human collection methods. In addition, it offers American Robotics recurring, software-like margins in return for these services. This model also presents the opportunity for continued software improvements, upgrades, and new features that can be monetized through tiered pricing and app store-like concepts, allowing for continued user experience improvement and potential increase in revenue per unit over time.



The RaaS business model offers many benefits for customers including:



Annual Subscription for Service: The Scout System is bundled into an annual subscription fee, encompassing the full suite of hardware, software, and services, allowing American Robotics to provide customers the highest performing product at the lowest possible cost.



Real-Time Automated Operation: Once installed, each Scout system operates at its maximum capacity. Automated missions occur multiple times per day, guaranteeing customers the highest quality data at the highest frequency.



Low Upfront Capital Costs: The Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) model allows American Robotics to lower the burden of upfront manufacturing and hardware costs. Aside from initial installation, set up and shipping costs, all that a customer pays for is the service that the Scout System provides.



Limited Long-term Risk: Subscription fees are billed annually, and replacement units can be swapped out at the end of the service life. American Robotics will also periodically install new software updates and provide access to new features, assuring optimal performance throughout a customer’s subscription.



No Maintenance Responsibilities: Our staff remotely oversee the operation of customer units and manage routine and unscheduled maintenance requirements.



No Customer Pilot Training: Both the technology itself and our staff oversee the real-time operation of a customer’s units. Health status and performance are constantly monitored to assure optimal performance, and no pilot training is required for a customer’s staff to integrate this technology into their business.



Reduced Warranty Exposure: American Robotics owns and operates each Scout System™ unit. This reduces warranty exposure and customer friction. Non-performing units will be replaced, repaired, and validated at our expense.



Our Products and Services



Ondas Networks



Ondas Networks has developed a next-generation radio platform specifically to meet the evolving data needs of large industrial and government customers and markets.  These markets are differentiated from consumer markets in that the customers assets are dispersed over very wide and remote geographies with specific challenges to installation, maintenance, and upgrades. These challenges led us to design a new type of software-based radio platform capable of supporting a long useful life to the network hardware.  Instead of using low cost, off the shelf, dedicated communications chipsets (“ASICs”), we selected powerful programmable embedded general-purpose processors, DSPs, and FPGAs, all of which are software upgradable. Our software defined radio (“SDR”) architecture, with more than 12 years in development and supported by a team of over 50 software engineers, allows us to customize almost any aspect of the air interface protocol, the key components of which are patented and have been incorporated into new IEEE wireless standards. The ability to constantly improve customer networks and hosted software applications with flexible, over-the-air software upgrade helps create customer loyalty and creates high switching costs.

Our FullMAX SDR platform is designed to enable highly secure and reliable industrial-grade connectivity for truly mission-critical applications. An end-to-end FullMAX network consists of connected wireless base stations, fixed and mobile edge radios and supporting technology all enabled by critical software developed and owned by Ondas Networks. The Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end FullMAX SDR platform is valued by our customers and ecosystem partners as they seek to leverage the value of MC-IoT applications for improved safety, efficiency, and profitability. Our IEEE 802.16s compliant equipment is designed to optimize performance of unused or underutilized low frequency licensed radio spectrum and narrower channels. We do this through various patented software algorithms including via “spectrum harvesting” techniques which aggregate narrowband channels to create increased broadband network capacity. Our channel aggregation algorithms include the ability to aggregate hard to utilize, non-contiguous narrowband channels and are a hallmark feature of a FullMAX broadband system.



The critical software algorithms powering our end-to-end FullMAX wireless SDR platform and related Fog-computing architecture have been developed by and are owned by Ondas Networks. FullMAX is an intelligent networking system which integrates core network management systems with edge computing resources including computing hardware and MC-IoT software applications. In the MC-IoT Fog enabled by FullMAX, base stations are enabled with a highly configurable Quality of Service algorithms which coordinate the data traffic within the Fog for both the edge radio and the resident MC-IoT applications. The intelligent base stations control and manage all network resources including our edge remotes; dynamically allocating bandwidth, prioritizing data packets and managing edge applications. The intelligent software-managed base stations determine whether to process data at the edge, distribute data traffic across the Fog to other edge remote radios or to transport information to the corporate Cloud. Our Edge remotes have embedded compute capability and are able to host MC-IoT applications including those from third party vendors via virtualized software systems managed in docker / container architectures and can also manage data from intelligent equipment or sensor networks that interface with the edge remotes in the field. Our software-managed edge remotes offer security via authentication, multi-layer encryption and virtual software firewalls which are requirements for mission-critical data networks.



We are dedicated to promoting standards-based wireless connectivity solutions for our customers. Our FullMAX platform is compliant with the mission critical wireless Industrial Internet IEEE 802.16s. The specifications in the IEEE 802.16s standard are primarily based on our FullMAX technology, and many of our customers and industrial partners actively supported our technology during the IEEE standards-making process. In January 2020, a new working group was launched by the IEEE to establish IEEE 802.16t, a further evolution of this wireless standard. The IEEE 802.16t working group includes industry-leading trade organizations such as the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (“TTCI”), the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), as well as representation from world-leading transportation and oil and gas companies. We expect our technology to remain a prominent feature of this evolving standard.



American Robotics



American Robotics provides our customers with turnkey automated data solutions designed to meet their unique requirements in the field. We do this via our internally developed Scout System™, our autonomous drone platform which provides commercial and government customers with the ability to continuously digitize, monitor and analyze their assets in near real-time.



The Scout System™ has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the real world. The Scout System™ consists of (i) Scout™ Drone, a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads (ii) the ScoutBaseTM, a ruggedized base station for housing, charging, data processing, and cloud transfer, and (iii) ScoutViewTM, American Robotics’ analytics and user interface software package, as well as a host of supporting technologies that connect these major subsystems. Using a suite of proprietary technologies, including DAA and other proprietary intelligent safety systems, American Robotics achieved the first and only approval for automated operations without a human on-site in the United States on January 15, 2021.



American Robotics’ Concept of Operations (CONOPS) was designed in concert with the end-to-end technology stack to optimize for FAA-approval of fully automated operation. The Company has developed a proprietary suite of layered, redundant technological risk mitigations and layered, redundant operational risk mitigations to achieve this industry-first FAA approval of continuous, automated, remote operations. The combination of AR’s technologies and the corresponding CONOPS enables a solution that is considered both uniquely safe and uniquely scalable, by taking piloting out of the hands of customers.

CONOPS Overview: A ScoutBase is installed at a fixed location within the desired Area of Operation (AO). Under AR’s current set of FAA approvals, a Scout drone is permitted to fly anywhere under 400 feet within a 2-mile radius of the ScoutBase and the accompanying ground-based DAA system. Once installed, no further physical human interaction is required to conduct daily operations. All pre-flight inspections, mission planning, flight, obstacle avoidance, air traffic avoidance, health diagnostics, and precision landing are conducted autonomously via our proprietary software. An American Robotics Remote Operator (RO) is located offsite in the Company’s Network Operations Center (NOC) and monitors the automated drone systems operations.



The Market for Our Products and Services



Ondas Networks



The global end markets for Ondas Networks’ MC-IoT wireless networking solutions are established, large, and we believe, poised to grow rapidly given the key role connectivity will play in next generation IoT-type applications. Firms like Cisco Systems, Inc. and Gartner, Inc. forecast billions of connected IoT devices installed throughout the economy; many of which are deployed for industrial applications. Dell’Oro Group, Inc. estimates that Wide Area IoT spending, including low power WAN deployments with which we compete, will reach $33.0 billion for carriers and infrastructure vendors by 2022, growing approximately 2.5X from 2017. In many of our industrial end markets, we believe the adoption of low-cost edge computing and increased penetration of “smart machinery” is driving demand for next-generation networks for IoT applications such as those powered by FullMAX. Demand for edge computing solutions is growing rapidly and adopting edge computing applications can help our customers run their businesses more efficiently, profitably, and safely. According to MarketsandMarkets the market for global edge computing solutions is expected to grow over 34% per year from $3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025. Ondas Networks is leveraging its industry expertise and FullMAX connectivity and Fog-computing platform to develop an enhanced range of products to capitalize on this expanding opportunity with the goal of becoming the leading supplier of private industrial networks.



We have targeted the North American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate antiquated legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. In addition to data capacity challenges, rail operators need to reliably cover the vast and often remotely located rail track and related infrastructure which extends nationwide. The rail operators require a next-generation, robust broadband system with significantly increased data throughput capacity and Fog networking capability. We believe a transition to integrated Fog-computing wireless communications systems will enable the rail operators to drive more intelligence to the edge of their operating environments enabling real time automation and better operator control of many critical operating systems related to train control, crossing safety, train and track integrity and drone operations. This upgrade cycle is being driven by a recent key event which occurred in August 2020 in which the Class 1 rail systems in the U.S. were awarded new nationwide “greenfield” wideband radio spectrum by the Federal Communications Committee (“FCC”). As part of the award, the rail operators are required by 2024, to vacate a series of legacy narrowband channels. The completion of this multiyear negotiation between the FCC and other licensed users is projected to generate a major network upgrade cycle for the rail industry which will support enhanced safety and improved efficiency and profitability of train operations.



The North American Rail Network is vast in scale, consisting of 140,000 miles of track, 25,000 locomotives, and 1.6 million railcars. Within this large footprint, we believe there are 200,000 highway crossings, with at least 65,000 of the crossings equipped with electronic systems today, a number which is expected to increase in the coming years. We believe a significant portion of the communications infrastructure has been in operation for more than 20 years and now requires a technological upgrade to support new applications and increased capacity requirements. Our FullMAX MC-IoT platform offers an excellent migration path for these applications. The Class I Railroads value the ability of our frequency-agnostic SDR architecture to enable a substantial data capacity increase utilizing the railroad’s existing wireless infrastructure and dedicated FCC licensed radio frequencies, as well as the flexibility to adapt to and take advantage of future changes in spectrum availability, as well as future business and operational requirements.



American Robotics



The total addressable market (“TAM”) for commercial drone applications is also large – measuring $127 billion according to a 2016 report from consulting firm PwC. For the vast majority of commercial drone applications, full automation is required to make economic sense. The time and cost requirements of human pilots are too high for the demanding and monotonous routines that must be performed to extract value.

American Robotics’ Scout System™ targets the majority of “drone-in-a-box”-applicable commercial and defense markets, as estimated by PwC. The commercial market is segmented into two primary categories, Agriculture and Industrial. AR estimates the collective TAM for the Scout System within these three target markets to be $114 billion. For each market, the core automation technology is the same, but the product is optimized for that set of use cases. Primary differences include payload as well as the user interface (“UI”) and user experience (“UX”) and analytics packages within ScoutView™.

Customer Activity



Ondas Networks



The majority of Ondas Networks customer activity has been with the Class 1 freight railroad operators and Siemens in North America. There are six Class I railroads in North America, all of which run multiple, frequency-specific networks for different applications. Our FullMAX platform has the flexibility to operate in all these frequency bands and will allow these customers the opportunity to better utilize their radio spectrum and add more high-value, data-intensive applications to their operations. Ondas Networks has completed multiple, ongoing testing and pilot programs with BNSF Railway and CSX Corporation, two North American Class I freight railroad operators in connection with the system validation performed on behalf of the Association of American Railroads’ (AAR) Wireless Communications Committee (WCC). Our initial focus with these rail customers has been for train control applications and related safety systems in the 900 MHz frequency band where the FCC has recently awarded our railroad customers new radio spectrum in connection with the Anterix 900 MHz Report and Order.



In November 2021, we received our first commercial order for the 900 MHz network from Siemens. We also received a purchase order in December 2021 to establish a Rail Lab (the “dot16 Rail Lab”) via Siemens on behalf of the AAR. The dot16 Rail Lab will host multiple Class 1 freight rail operators where they will perform on going network design and configuration related to optimizing the performance of our IEEE 802.16 complaint systems in connection with wide-scale field deployment. We expect the commercial rollout of the 900 MHz to accelerate with the Class 1 freight rail operators throughout 2022 with multiple rail customers providing purchase orders and deploying our software-defined network. We expect a 900 MHz network upgrade cycle across all Class I railroad systems over the next few years in order to comply with FCC license requirements and meet business needs related to safety and profitability.



American Robotics



American Robotics’ Scout System™ addresses a wide number of applications and use case across industrial, enterprise and government end markets. We believe strong demand for AR’s automated data solutions is reflected in a robust pipeline of potential customers which grew significantly following the FAA approval received in January 2021. American Robotics launched its commercial marketing effort in May 2021, after receiving an initial investment from Ondas Holdings. Marketing activity accelerated in August 2021 after the acquisition by Ondas Holdings which allowed for the further scaling of people and infrastructure to support customers in the field. American Robotics initial marketing activity is focused on the mining, oil & gas, rail and solar industries. In these markets we focus our attention on large, sophisticated and often blue-chip industrial customers with active drone programs and who have the ability and intent to deploy fleets of drones with a scalable solution such as the Scout System™. We refer to these customers as “Franchise Customers”.



In 2021, American Robotics announced purchase orders from Stockpile Reports and Conoco-Phillips and, in January 2022, a purchase order was received from Chevron Corporation. In addition, American Robotics is in the final procurement stage with a number of other industrial customers, with expected purchase orders and installations occurring throughout 2022. AR’s strategy is to deliver an exceptional service experience to these Franchise Customers in order to generate additional purchases of the Scout System™ for nationwide fleet deployments.

Manufacturing, Availability and Dependence upon Suppliers 



Ondas Networks and American Robotics utilize outsourced manufacturing partners in building of product to fulfill customer orders. Utilizing contract manufacturers allows us to focus on designing, developing and selling our products. Furthermore, outsourced manufacturing allows us to leverage the economies of scale and expertise of specialized outsourced manufacturers, reduce manufacturing and supply chain risk and distribution costs.



Ondas Networks designs the printed circuit boards and enclosures for our radios and maintains the bill of materials for all of the products we manufacturer. A Bill of Materials (“BOM”) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture the end product. The physical manufacturing of FullMAX circuit boards is outsourced to best-in-class industrial contract manufacturers. The contract manufacturer is responsible for sourcing the majority of components in the BOM, assembling the components onto the printed circuit boards and then delivering the final boards to us. Once at our facility, the boards are tested, then placed into enclosures and programmed with the appropriate software. The radios are then configured according to the requirement of the network and run through system level tests before being packaged and shipped to the customer. Ondas Networks maintains multiple contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to ensure competitive pricing and to reduce the risk from a single manufacturer.



American Robotics designs the Scout System™ and specifies all components of the BOM including the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture the end product. These assemblies incorporate a combination of custom-developed components and COTS components. Our acoustics-based DAA sub-system is provided by a California-based supplier, and we retain the contractual right to manufacturer that DAA system ourselves. The building of a Scout System™ is outsourced to best-in-class contract manufacturers for fabrication and assembly. We utilize different contract manufacturers for the Scout™ Drone and Scout Base™. Once complete, the contract manufacturers deliver the finished products to our facility where software is loaded and system-level QA is performed before being packaged and shipped to the customer location for installation. American Robotics works with a select group of contract manufacturers and has access to a large number of other comparable contract manufacturers.

American Robotics relies primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property. As of this filing, American Robotics held a total of 4 issued patents in the U.S., 6 pending patent applications in the U.S., and 6 international pending patent application. AR’s patents expire between 2036 and 2039, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. AR’s intellectual property incorporates internally developed software and hardware design incorporating machine and computer vision and was developed with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This intellectual property is critical to the development of end-to-end systems which reliably enable the automated operation of drones in real-world environments,



We have a policy of requiring our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and parties with which we do business to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure (“NDAs”) and assignment of invention agreements before disclosure of any of our confidential or proprietary information.



Seasonality



We do not believe that the industry in which Ondas Networks competes is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.



The industries in which American Robotics offers its automated data solutions is subject to some seasonal sales fluctuation, which differs by end markets and customer geographic locations. For example, weather and growing patterns means that demand from agricultural customers is typically greatest early in the growing season. Most industrial end markets are subject to much less seasonality.



Dependence on a Single Customer



Because we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately $1,204,000 and $1,599,000 of our revenue, or approximately 41% and 55%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately $1,012,000 and $1,005,000 of our revenue, or approximately 47%, and 46%, respectively.



Competition



Ondas Networks



We compete with alternatives to wireless technology, public cellular data networks and private wireless networking products from other manufactures. We believe that each of these competing solutions has core weaknesses when compared to FullMAX, as described below.



Public cellular data networks:




● | Public networks are more vulnerable to cyber security attacks from anywhere in the world including denial of service attacks; private networks can operate independent of the public internet. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Public networks are more susceptible to prolonged outages during man-made and natural disasters (e.g. 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, etc.), exactly when utilities and mission critical entities require the greatest reliability. 
● | Public networks are typically designed for population coverage rather than the geographic areas required by critical infrastructure providers, which often include remote locations. 
● | Public networks are by definition oversubscribed, shared networks without the necessary prioritization service to support mission critical applications. 
● | Public networks typically use shared infrastructure including tower sites and long-haul fiber connections resulting in vulnerabilities at many points. 
● | Public networks are designed to support high capacity downloading and streaming applications with limited upload bandwidth available. Industrial networks typically require the reverse traffic flow, often uploading data from a large number of remote locations.

Other private wireless products:




● | Unlicensed Point to Multipoint Wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi) — This equipment is very inexpensive to purchase but is subject to interference, has many security vulnerabilities, uses a contention-based protocol and transmits only over short range. Deploying Wi-Fi over wide areas is cost prohibitive. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Private Licensed Narrowband Wireless Radios — These networks can provide good coverage and range but are typically too slow and lack sufficient bandwidth to support new applications and the increased number of data connections required. 




Alternate technologies:




● | Satellite Technologies — These technologies provide good coverage, but throughput is limited, and latency is too high to support mission-critical applications for our customers. These technologies can be very costly as compared to our products and systems. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) — LP-WAN solutions such as LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT are architected with lower power, the purpose of which is to make these typically sensor-based networks lower-cost solutions. The low powered equipment means these systems have lower throughput and higher latency and are not reliable for mission-critical applications that require both monitoring and control functions. 

American Robotics



We compete with other drone OEMs providing a variety of solutions for inspection, security, asset tracking and other applications. We compete on many dimensions with system performance being differentiated by the level of autonomous operation, ease of use, reliability, safety, and government regulations. Further, leading automated data solution providers must provide diverse payload capabilities for data collection, along with robust, advanced analytics programs that are specific for each industry served.



None of our competitors offering automated UAS systems have secured FAA approval or waivers comparable to those received by American Robotics and are not able to operate at scale without human intervention when systems are deployed.



Governmental Regulations 



Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including:




1. | authorization from the FCC for operation in various licensed frequency bands, 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | FAA regulations and approvals unique to the operation of commercial or industrial drones, 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | customers’ licenses from the FCC, 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers, 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection, 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects, 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | wage and hour regulations, 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements, 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. | building and electrical codes; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10. | special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe we have the licenses materially required to conduct our operations, and we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The operation of our manufactured products by our customers (network providers and service providers) in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in a manner not in compliance with local law could result in fines, business disruption, or harm to our reputation. The changes to regulatory and technological requirements may also alter our product offerings, impacting our market share and business.  Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or could give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.

Environmental Regulation



Our operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, federal, state and local environmental laws and substantial related regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; protect the health and safety of workers; and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Notwithstanding these burdens, we believe that we are in material compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations.



There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements nor competitive positions as a result of these environmental regulations.



Employees 



As of March 18, 2022, we have 74 full-time employees, including 24 in the Ondas Networks segment and 50 in the American Robotics segment. In addition, we have consulting agreements with 10 consultants for manufacturing, supply chain, documentation, engineering, regulatory, IT, and business development support. Additionally, from time to time, we may hire temporary employees. We also utilize contractors to manufacture components, for certain research and development and for system deployment functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we are unaware of any union organizing efforts. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
