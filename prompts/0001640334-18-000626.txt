The skin care products that we will distribute are designed to address various skin care needs. Those products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, body care, exfoliators, acne and oil correctors, facial masks, cleansing devices and sun care products. A number of those products are developed for use on particular areas of the body, such as the face or hands or around the eyes.

Market
 
We believe our market will be resellers who recognize the needs of the targeted consumer. Our strategy will be to target spas, department stores and specialty stores that sell similar skin care products. We hope that our product positioning will assist in the marketing and distribution of those skin care products. We anticipate that we will reach our targeted reseller market by the following types of resellers:
Spas and Health Clubs – Most high quality day spas and health clubs (and many upscale spas at resort properties) use generic products. Our goal will be to develop affiliations with select spas in urban areas and vacation destinations to whom we will market and sell those skin care products.
Lifestyle Retailers – We anticipate that the skin care products will be lifestyle-based rather than the typical soaps and potions of natural product retailers. These retailers exist in almost every city and have developed loyal and sophisticated customer bases.
 
Additionally, we anticipate that we will market those skin care products to cosmetic specialty retailers and boutique department stores.
 
We believe that the targeted in users of those skin care products are between the ages of 20 and 65 and are predominantly female. We believe they are urban professionals with at least some college level education. The targeted in user has an active lifestyle and is concerned about social and environmental issues. Mind and body wellness are important to them. They belong to a health club; take yoga, pilates or taichi lessons. The effects of aging and maintenance of a youthful appearance are a part of their life.

Competition
 
The skin care business is characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions. We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
 
Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. They include, among others, L’Oreal S.A.; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; Beiersdorf AG; LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Coty, Inc.; The Procter & Gamble Company; Avon Products, Inc.; Chanel S.A.; and Groupe Clarins. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have developed their own skin care brands. Certain of our competitors may also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
At the present we do not have any patents or trademarks.
 
Need for any Government Approval
 
There is no approval required for the marketing and distribution of those skin care products in Taiwan; provided, however, pursuant to the Statute for the Control of Cosmetic Hygiene promulgated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, we are required to file an application with the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan for reference purposes.
 
We have been informed by appropriate representatives of A.C. that the skin care products we plan to market and distribute pursuant to the Distribution Agreement are classified as cosmetics not containing any medical, poisonous or potent drugs under the Republic of China Statute for Control of Cosmetic Hygiene. Accordingly, those products are not necessarily subject to any inspection to obtain approval for their sales. The labeling of those packages will clearly indicate in Chinese the name and address of the manufacturer, the name of the product, the ingredients, the usage and directions, the weight, the manufacturing date, the expiration date, the name and address of the importer. We have been informed by those representatives that those skin care products are, currently, appropriate for marketing and distribution in Taiwan. Accordingly, we intend to market and distribute those products as soon as we receive the appropriate sales permit. In that regard, we will be required to obtain from the appropriate local authority, i.e., the Taipei City Office of Commerce, a permit similar to a business license required by most U.S. cities.
