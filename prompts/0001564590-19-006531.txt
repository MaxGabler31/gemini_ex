Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company incorporated in Delaware on May 26, 2009, that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our investment activities are managed by THL Credit Advisors LLC, or THL Credit Advisors, and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of THL Credit Advisors and its affiliates. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. See “-Business Development Company Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. We are also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act.

 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation, primarily through investments in privately negotiated debt and equity securities of middle market companies. We are a direct lender to middle market companies and invest primarily in directly originated first lien senior secured loans, including unitranche investments. In certain instances, we also make second lien secured loans and subordinated, or mezzanine, debt investments, which may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock or similar securities, and direct equity investments. Our first lien senior secured loans may be structured as traditional first lien senior secured loans or as unitranche loans. Unitranche structures may combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured as well as second lien and subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and/or subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the “last-out” tranche or subordinated tranche (or piece) of the unitranche loan. We also may provide advisory services to managed funds. 
 We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, with certain of our affiliates. See “-Material Conflicts of Interests” below. We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification.
 We define middle market companies to mean both public and privately-held companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, generally between $5 million and $25 million. We expect to generate returns primarily through a combination of contractual interest payments on debt investments, equity appreciation, origination and similar fees. We can offer no assurances that we will achieve our investment objective.

Since April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, through December 31, 2018, we have been responsible for making, on behalf of ourselves, managed funds and separately managed account, over $2.1 billion in aggregate commitments to 105 separate portfolio companies through a combination of both initial and follow-on investments. Since April 2010 through December 31, 2018, we, along with our managed funds and separately managed accounts, have received $1.5 billion of proceeds from the realization of investments. The Company alone has received $1.3 billion of proceeds from the realization of its investments. As of December 31, 2018, our managed funds, THL Credit Greenway, LLC, or Greenway, and THL Credit Greenway II, LLC and its separately managed account, collectively Greenway II, have received $189.4 million, or 126.2% of committed capital, and $165.4 million, or 88.4% of the committed capital, respectively.
 As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in “eligible portfolio companies.” Under the relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules the term “eligible portfolio company” includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States.
 We are also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
 We are permitted to borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (which generally allows us to incur leverage equal to up to one half of our total assets). We have used, and expect to continue to use, our credit facilities and other borrowings, along with proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private securities to finance our investment objectives. See “-Business Development Company Regulations” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations.

 THL Credit Advisors LLC
 Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, THL Credit Advisors. THL Credit Advisors is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments, and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.

THL Credit Advisors was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on June 26, 2009 and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. THL Credit Advisors is an alternative credit investment manager for both direct lending and tradable credit investments through public and private vehicles, commingled funds including collateralized loan obligations, and separately managed accounts. THL Credit Advisors and its credit-focused affiliates managed assets of $15.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 across its two primary investment strategies: Direct Lending and Tradable Credit.
 THL Credit Advisors benefits from a scaled and integrated business that draws on a diverse resource base and the credit and industry expertise of the entire platform. Fundamental credit analysis, rigorous and disciplined underwriting, well-structured investments and ongoing monitoring are the hallmarks of its credit culture.
 THL Credit Advisors’ Direct Lending strategy invests primarily in secured loans consisting of first lien senior secured, including unitranche investments, and, to a lesser extent, second lien facilities. In certain instances, THL Credit Advisors’ Direct Lending strategy also makes subordinated debt investments and equity investments such as warrants, preferred stock or other similar securities.
 THL Credit Advisors’ Tradable Credit strategy manages investments in secured bank loans, structured credit and high-yield securities through CLOs, separate accounts, sub-advisory and various fund formats, including private funds, certain CLOs and as advisor to THL Credit Senior Loan Fund (NYSE: TSLF) (“TSLF”), a nondiversified, closed-end management investment company. The Advisor may serve as investment advisor to additional private funds, registered closed-end funds and CLOs in the future.
 THL Credit Advisors is headquartered in Boston, with additional origination teams in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York, allowing it to be close to its portfolio companies as well as its origination and syndication sources. Over the years, THL Credit Advisors has developed deep and diverse national relationships that it leverages to maximize investment opportunities across its strategies.
 THL Credit Advisor’s Direct Lending investment committee, which serves as our investment committee, is comprised of Christopher J. Flynn, Terrence W. Olson, W. Montgomery Cook, James R. Fellows and Howard H. Wu (the “Investment Committee Members”).
 THL Credit Advisors has received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to negotiate, subject to the conditions of the order, co-investments among us and certain of its other investment advisory clients. See “Material Conflicts of Interests” below.
 THL Credit Advisors also serves as our Administrator and leases office space to us and provides us with equipment and office services. The tasks of the Administrator include overseeing our financial records, preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC and generally monitoring the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.
 Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (“THL Partners”)
 The Advisor is owned in part by a partnership consisting of certain of the partners of THL Partners. THL Partners is one of the world’s oldest and most experienced private equity firms. Since its founding in 1974, the firm has raised over $25 billion of equity capital and invested in more than 140 portfolio companies with an aggregate value of over $200 billion.

The firm partners with portfolio company management to identify and implement operational and strategic improvements to accelerate sustainable revenue and profit growth. THL Partners strives to build companies of lasting value and generate superior investment returns. We believe we benefit from THL Credit Advisors’ relationship with THL Partners. THL Credit Advisors has access to the industry knowledge of THL Partners’ investment team to consult with the THL Partners team on specific industry issues, trends and other complementary matters.

Investment Approach
 Our investment approach consists of the following four separate and distinct phases: (1) sourcing; (2) selecting; (3) structuring; and (4) supervising investments. Sourcing involves our efforts to generate as vast a universe of relevant and actionable investment opportunities as possible. Selecting represents our decision-making process regarding which of those investments to pursue. Structuring summarizes our creative approach to deploying capital on a case-by-case basis in a way that maximizes value. Supervising is a reference to our ongoing rigorous credit monitoring.
Sourcing
 The elements of our sourcing efforts will include: (i) determining the market in which we intend to participate; (ii) identifying the opportunities within that market; (iii) having a clear strategy; (iv) knowing the competition; and (v) distinguishing our competitive advantages.
Determining the Market
 We invest primarily in debt securities of sponsored issuers based in the middle market mainly in the United States. Our debt investments are composed of directly originated first lien senior secured loans, including unitranche investments. In certain instances, we also may make second lien loans and subordinated or mezzanine debt investments, which may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock and other similar securities, and direct equity co-investments. Our first lien senior secured loans may be structured as traditional first lien senior secured loans or as unitranche loans. Unitranche structures may combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured as well as second lien and/or subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the “last-out” tranche. We also may provide advisory services to managed funds.
Market Opportunity
 We believe the environment for investing in middle market companies is attractive for several reasons, including:
 Improved company fundamentals creating favorable lending trends. We believe that middle market companies are experiencing improved fundamentals driven by a stabilized economy and an increase in confidence. Middle market companies have recently displayed improvements in operating performance, resulting in stronger credit quality. Default levels remain relatively low, and volatility in the broader capital markets has eased, resulting in more middle market companies seeking growth capital at attractive lender credit metrics.
 Meaningful availability of investable capital at private equity firms. Recent private equity data shows approximately $1.2 trillion of cash reserves that private equity fund managers are actively looking to allocate to transactions involving new or existing portfolio companies.1  Private equity funds will often prefer to support these transactions with debt securities, including first lien and second lien loans from sources such as us.
 
Consolidation among commercial banks has reduced their focus on middle market business. We believe that many bank lenders have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle market companies in favor of lending to large corporate clients, managing capital markets transactions and providing other non-credit services to their customers. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets and are requiring existing issuers to reduce leverage. As a result, it allows us a greater opportunity to originate proprietary investment opportunities; a situation that we believe the Investment Professionals are equipped to capitalize upon as a result of their extensive experience.

Increased lending regulation has limited the ability of traditional lenders to provide capital to middle market companies. Heightened scrutiny of large bank institutions by regulatory bodies has prompted lending guidelines that have sought to limit leverage, deter banks from lengthening payment timelines and restrict banks from holding certain CLO securities. In response, banks have been participating less in the middle market lending arena, opening up opportunities for alternative lenders such as us. In addition to new lending activity, as companies look to refinance existing loans that do not abide by the current guidelines, the market opportunity should continue to expand.
 Middle market companies are increasingly seeking lenders with long-term capital to provide flexible solutions for their debt and equity financing needs. Middle market companies continue to seek lenders with long-term capital to provide flexible solutions for their debt and equity financing needs. We believe that many middle market companies prefer to execute transactions with private capital providers such as us, rather than execute high-yield bond or equity transactions in the public markets, which may necessitate increased financial and regulatory compliance and reporting obligations. Further, we believe many middle market companies are inclined to seek capital from a small number of skilled, reliable and predictable providers with access to permanent capital that can satisfy their specific needs and serve as value-added financial partners with an understanding of, and longer-term view oriented towards the growth of their businesses. We aim to develop a constructive partnership with its portfolio companies to help them navigate economic cycles and operational issues which will arise.
 The large yet fragmented middle market may offer lenders more attractive economic terms compared to the more efficient, syndicated markets. Investing in debt securities in the middle market may offer more favorable returns relative to their investment risk, when compared to investments in public high yield or syndicated bank loan securities. Furthermore, private equity sponsors focused on the middle market seek lenders with domain expertise and certainty of closing rather than running a fully efficient arranger process. Directly originated investments in the middle market may, in our experience, permit higher yields on investments and may also benefit from other more favorable terms relative to the broadly syndicated market, including lower leverage, tighter covenant packages, stronger call protection, and greater control of a work-out process in the case of a default.
 Investment Strategy
 We believe a strategy focused primarily on debt securities in middle market companies has a number of compelling attributes. First, the market for these instruments is relatively inefficient, allowing an experienced investor an opportunity to produce high risk-adjusted returns. Second, downside risk can be managed through an extensive credit-oriented underwriting process, creative structuring techniques and intensive portfolio monitoring. We believe private debt investments generally require the highest level of credit and legal due diligence among debt or credit asset classes. Lastly, compared with equity investments, returns on debt investments tend to be less volatile given the substantial current return component and seniority in the capital structure relative to equity. Though it is not part of our investment strategy, we currently have, and may acquire in the future, control investments in portfolio companies. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Our equity ownership in a portfolio company may represent a control investment. Our ability to exit a control investment may be limited”.
 We will consider opportunities within all industries and do not have fixed guidelines for industry concentration. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio investments spanned several industries and the largest industries represented and the percentage of our investment portfolio at fair value were as follows: (i) industrials and manufacturing at 19.09%; (ii) consumer products and services at 14.00%; (iii) healthcare at 12.20%; (iv) IT services at 10.21%; and (v) energy / utilities at 7.51%.
 Competition
 Our primary competitors to providing financing to middle market companies will include other BDCs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, CLO funds, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial and marketing resources than we do. For example, 
 9

some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions in Investment Company Act imposes on us as a BDC. 
 Competitive Advantages
 We believe that we possess the following competitive advantages over many other capital providers to middle market companies:
 Experienced management team. As stated above, the Investment Committee Members are experienced and many have worked together extensively and together with their past investment experiences have invested through multiple business and credit cycles in a variety of credit products with the objective of generating attractive, long-term, risk-adjusted returns. Each of the Investment Committee Members brings a unique investment perspective and skill-set by virtue of their complementary collective experiences as both debt and equity investors.
 Proactive Sourcing Platform. We take a proactive, hands-on, and creative approach to investment sourcing. Our disciplined origination process includes proprietary tools and resources and employs a national platform with a regional focus. With offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York, the Investment Committee Members have a deep and diverse relationship network in the debt capital and private equity markets. These activities and relationships provide an important channel through which we generate investment opportunities consistent with our investment strategy.
 Significant institutional expertise and brand recognition gained from investing approximately $2.1 billion in 105 companies between June 2009 and December 31, 2018, across our direct lending credit strategy. We have developed the institutional knowledge and operational infrastructure required to successfully achieve our investment objectives. We benefit from proprietary deal flow from strong relationships with sponsors cultivated over eight years of doing business in the middle market. Our comprehensive underwriting methodology and monitoring processes have been implemented across all five regional offices. Additionally, the Investment Committee Members are supported by an experienced operational and administrative team.
 Relationship with THL Partners. We are managed by THL Credit Advisors, the credit affiliate of THL Partners. As such, we have access to the relationship network and industry knowledge of THL Partners to enhance transaction sourcing capabilities. This also provides us with the opportunity to consult with investment team from THL Partners on specific industry issues, trends and other complementary matters.
 Investments teams with a regional focus set up in Industry Verticals. We take a proactive, hands-on, and creative approach to investment sourcing. Our disciplined origination process includes proprietary tools and resources and employs a national platform with a regional focus. With offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York and Los Angeles, we have a deep and diverse relationship network. Given our five-office footprint, we are closer to smaller, regional sponsors and have cultivated deep relationships with these private equity firms. In many cases, regional sponsors prefer to partner with local lenders. Once an investment opportunity is sourced by one of our fives offices, the opportunity is transitioned to a lead underwriter while the individual who originated the opportunity remains closely involved in a relationship management capacity. We cover three primary industry verticals: Business & Financial Services (New York), Consumer & Healthcare (Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles) and Information Services & Media (Los Angeles). Given our emphasis on three primary industry verticals, we have a strong preference for industry or sector-focused funds and/or sponsors who specialize in only several sectors as opposed to generalist private equity firms. Many middle market sponsors do not staff an internal capital markets resource (i.e., one who maintains a database and network of debt financing partners/arrangers); as such, a sponsor’s deal team leader without this resource is directly responsible for arranging debt financing as part of his/her deal process on a case-by-case basis. Middle market sponsors with this profile appreciate the value proposition of partnering with a trusted, local relationship and respected lender with deep domain expertise.

Selecting
 Selecting investments to pursue requires us to have an employable investment philosophy, know our key metrics, have a process to consistently measure those metrics, and implement a repeatable underwriting process that enables our investment committee to make well-reasoned decisions.
Investment Philosophy
 Our investment philosophy focuses on capital preservation, relative value, and establishing close relationships with portfolio companies. It is our expectation that this multifaceted focus should generate consistent, attractive, risk-adjusted returns coupled with low volatility.
 Capital Preservation. We believe that the key to capital preservation is comprehensive and fundamental credit analysis. We take a long term view of our investments and portfolio with the perspective that most of our investments may need to endure through economic cycles. We refrain from market timing and generally do not enter into investments with the sole intention of realizing short term gains based on changes in market prices. However, we will not hesitate to sell an investment if we believe that it is deteriorating in value and that more recovery will be obtained by selling rather than holding the investment.
 Relative Value. Relative value is an essential part of every investment decision. Relative value is determined in a variety of ways including comparisons to other opportunities available in the same asset class and with portfolio companies in the same or similar industries. Relative value is also analyzed across asset classes (senior vs. subordinate, secured vs. unsecured, debt vs. equity) to ensure that the return of a potential investment is appropriate relative to its position in the capital structure.
Key Investment Metrics
 Our value-oriented investment philosophy is primarily focused on maximizing yield relative to risk. Upon identifying a potential opportunity, we perform an initial screen to determine whether pursuing intensive due diligence is merited. As part of this process, we have identified several criteria we believe are important in evaluating and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest may not meet all of these criteria.
 Value orientation/positive cash flow. Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental credit analysis and has a distinct value orientation. We will generally focus on companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that are profitable at the time of investment on an operating cash flow basis. Although we obtain liens on collateral when appropriate and available, we are primarily focused on the predictability of future cash flow. We generally do not intend to invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans.
 Seasoned management with significant equity ownership. Strong, committed management teams are important to the success of an investment and we focus on companies where strong management teams are either already in place or where new management teams have been identified. Additionally, we generally require the portfolio companies to have in place compensation provisions that appropriately incentivize management to succeed and to act in our interests as investors.
 Strong competitive position. We seek to invest in companies that have developed competitive advantages and defensible market positions within their respective markets, provide a needed product or service and are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.
 Exit strategy. We seek companies that we believe will generate consistent cash flow to repay our loans and reinvest in their respective businesses. We expect such internally generated cash flow in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we exit from our investments over time. In addition, we invest in companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities for the equity component of our returns. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or another capital market transaction.
 11

Due Diligence and Investment Process
 We employ a rigorous and disciplined underwriting and due diligence process. Our process includes a comprehensive understanding of a portfolio company’s industry, market, operational, financial, organizational and legal position and prospects. In addition to our own analysis, we frequently use the service of third parties (either those of the sponsor, if applicable, or those which we retain) for quality of earnings reports, environmental diligence, legal reviews, industry and customer surveys, and background checks. We conduct thorough reference and background checks on senior management for all investments, including, but not limited to reference calls to several constituencies including senior management of past employers, business associates, customers, industry experts, such as equity research analysts and, when appropriate, competitors. All of our underwriting teams operate from our Chicago office, which results in greater collaboration and centralization of the overall underwriting process. 
 We seek portfolio companies that have proven management teams that have a vested interest in the company in the form of a meaningful level of equity ownership, that generate stable and predictable cash flow, and whose market position is defensible. We invest in companies with the expectation that we will own the investment through a complete business cycle, and possibly a recession, and we determine the appropriate amount of debt for the company accordingly. In addition, we view a sale of the company which might result in a refinancing of our investment as a possibility but not an expectation. Our intention is to craft strong and lender-friendly credit agreements with covenants, events of default, remedies and inter-creditor agreements being an integral part of our legal documents.
 Our due diligence typically includes the following elements (although not all elements necessarily form part of every due diligence project):
 Portfolio Company Characteristics: key levers of the business including a focus on drivers of cash flow and growth; revenue visibility; customer and supplier concentrations; historical revenue and margin trends; fixed versus variable costs; free cash flow analysis; portfolio company performance in view of industry performance; and sensitivity analysis around various future performance scenarios (with a focus on downside scenario analysis);
 Industry Analysis: including the portfolio company’s position within the context of the general economic environment and relevant industry cycles; industry size and growth rates; competitive landscape; barriers to entry and potential new entrants; product position and defensibility of market share; technological, regulatory and similar threats; and pricing power and cost considerations;
 Management: including the quality, breadth and depth of the portfolio company’s management; track record and prior experience; background checks; reputation; compensation and equity incentives; corporate overhead; motivation; and interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors;
 Financial Analysis: an understanding of relevant financial ratios and statistics, including various leverage, liquidity, free cash flow and fixed charge coverage ratios; impact on ratios in various future performance scenarios and comparison of applicable ratios to industry competitors; satisfaction with the auditor of the financial statements; and quality of earnings analysis;
 Capital Structure: diverse considerations regarding leverage (including understanding seniority and leverage multiples); ability to service debt; collateral and security protections; covenants and guarantees; equity investment amounts and participants (where applicable); and review of other significant structural terms and pertinent legal documentation; and,
 Collateral and Enterprise Value: analysis of relevant collateral coverage, including assets on a liquidation basis and enterprise value on a going concern basis; matrix analysis of cash flow and valuation multiples under different scenarios along with recovery estimates; and comparison to recent transaction multiples and valuations.
 12

Underwriting Process
 We employ an extensive due diligence approach tailored to each particular investment opportunity. To begin, we review the information memorandum that the company presenting the investment opportunity or its intermediary has prepared, and discuss the opportunity at a high level with the company’s management team, the sponsor or the intermediary, as applicable. Based on that initial high-level review, the investment team submits a customized due diligence questionnaires request to the company or intermediary. Sometimes the company or intermediary responds directly with materials, and other times there is an online data room that the investment team is invited to review. If the investment opportunity involves a sponsor that has performed a diligence review of the company, the investment team reviews the sponsor’s due diligence reports and analyses. The investment team supplements the document review with phone calls and meetings with the intermediary, sponsor and company’s management team, as applicable. Members of the investment team may also speak with business contacts who are industry experts who provide color on industry and market trends, without discussing the specific investment opportunity. Such industry experts may include employees of THL Partners or their portfolio companies, and persons in THL Credit Advisors’ and THL Partners’ vast network of business contacts. Members of the investment team build a preliminary financial model and review financial statements as part of the analysis on whether the opportunity is attractive.
 If the investment team believes the opportunity to be compelling or worth further discussion with the larger group, it will prepare a screening memo outlining the opportunity, including a company overview, situation overview, financial summary, investment thesis, risk factors and recommendations for next steps. The screening memo will be reviewed and discussed by all investment professionals (including the investment committee). Members of the investment committee in particular will ask detailed questions about the investment opportunity of the investment team. While no formal vote of the investment committee occurs at this stage, if any member of the investment committee expresses significant concerns about the investment opportunity then the investment team will be unlikely to proceed further.
 During such discussions, the investment team will compile diligence questions raised by the larger group, and formulate a strategy for engaging outside consultants, legal and financial advisors and additional industry experts, as needed.
 Following such a discussion, if the investment professionals (including the investment committee) believe the opportunity to be compelling, the investment team will then pursue the next stages of diligence and draft a term sheet or initial indication of interest when appropriate. Such documentation will then be presented to the sponsor or intermediary, as appropriate, and shared with the company.
 If the investment team decides that the opportunity offers an attractive risk-adjusted return and we are competitively positioned to be awarded the deal, it will begin to work towards final approval by the investment committee by performing confirmatory due diligence. As part of this process, members of the investment team will conduct, among others, in-person meetings with management, in-depth review of historical financial data, thorough reviews of loan documents and material contracts as well as research relating to the company’s industry, customers, suppliers and competitors.
 THL Credit Advisors’ in-house counsel will engage outside legal counsel for the opportunity, as well as industry-specific consultants, if appropriate, and accountants. If the investment opportunity involves a sponsor, the investment team may coordinate with the sponsor on engaging such consultants and accountants, and if the investment opportunity involves a co-investor, the investment team will coordinate with the co-investor on engaging all such advisors. Legal counsel will perform legal due diligence, the accountants will perform accounting due diligence, including a quality of earnings report if one does not yet exist, and the industry-specific consultants will diligence various areas such as regulatory restrictions, specific vendor or customer relationships and background checks on the management team.
 The investment team will then present its complete findings in the form of a comprehensive memo to the investment committee and ask for official approval of the proposed investment.
 13

Investment Committee
 The purpose of the investment committee is to evaluate and approve, as deemed appropriate, all investments by us. The committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee’s members to the analysis and consideration of every investment. The committee also serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to THL Credit Advisors’ investment philosophies and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements.
 In addition to reviewing investments, the investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and investment sourcing are also reviewed on a regular basis. Members of our investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with the investment committee early in their analysis. This process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently.
 Each transaction is presented to the investment committee in a formal written report. Each potential sale or exit of an existing investment is also presented to the investment committee. Our investment committee currently consists of Christopher J. Flynn, Terrence W. Olson, W. Montgomery Cook, James R. Fellows and Howard H. Wu. To approve a new investment, or to exit or sell an existing investment, the consent of a majority of the members of the committee is required.
 Structuring
 Our approach to structuring involves us choosing the most appropriate variety of securities for each particular investment; and negotiating the best and most favorable terms.
 Investment Structure
 In order to achieve our investment objective, we invest primarily in directly originated first lien senior secured loans, including unitranche investments. In certain instances, we also make second lien loans and subordinated, or mezzanine, debt investments, which may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock or similar securities, and direct equity investments. Typically, our investments will be approximately $5 million to $25 million of capital per transaction and have maturities of five to seven years. In determining whether a prospective investment satisfies our investment criteria, we generally seek a high total return potential on a risk-adjusted basis, although there can be no assurance we will find investments satisfying that criterion or that any such investments will perform in accordance with expectations.
 We generally do not intend to invest in startup companies, operationally distressed situations or companies with speculative business plans. In addition, we may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in opportunistic investments which will be intended to diversify or complement the remainder of our portfolio and to enhance our returns to stockholders. These investments may include high yield bonds, private equity investments, investments in financing companies, securities of public companies that are broadly traded and securities of non-U.S. companies. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade.
 Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we will work with the management of that portfolio company and its other capital providers, including, as applicable, senior, junior, and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We will negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure. Investments will include stringent structural and credit protections. The legal review process and documentation will be of paramount importance. Internal counsel of THL Credit Advisors will be closely involved in every investment that we make. Investment professionals working with internal counsel drive the principal negotiation of legal terms in connection with the issuance of term sheets. They continue to be involved in negotiations, along with outside counsel who lead the transactions, throughout the legal documentation process. This involvement on each transaction will provide consistent structural and credit protections across investments.

Security types we invest in include:
 First Lien Senior Secured Loans We invest in first lien or senior secured loans, and expect such loans to have terms of three to seven years. A first-lien loan is typically senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer’s capital structure and has the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. Our first-lien loans may include stand-alone first-lien loans, “last out” unitranche loans, split-collateral loans, and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans.

• | Stand-alone first-lien loans. Stand-alone first-lien loans are traditional first-lien loans. All lenders in the facility have equal rights to the collateral that is subject to the first-priority security interest.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Last out” unitranche loans. The “last out” tranche in a unitranche facility is subject to a waterfall that provides that the “first-out” tranche will be paid out prior to the “last-out” tranche in the event of certain trigger events which customarily would include an enforcement action against collateral. Further, the “last-out” tranche in a unitranche facility may provide certain agreements with respect to the allocation of interest and amortization payments among the tranches. These arrangements may be set forth in an “agreement among lenders,” and/or in the underlying credit agreement, which provides lenders with “first out” and “last out” payment streams based on a single lien on the collateral. Since the “first out” lenders generally have priority over the “last out” lenders for receiving payment under certain specified events of default, or upon the occurrence of other triggering events under intercreditor agreements or agreements among lenders, the “last out” lenders bear a greater risk and, in exchange, receive a higher effective interest rate, through arrangements among the lenders, than the “first out” lenders or lenders in stand-alone first-lien loans.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Split Collateral” loans are credit facilities in which the lenders have a first lien on certain assets and a second lien on other assets. Customarily, one credit facility enjoys a first lien on fixed assets such as equipment and real estate and a second lien on cash and accounts receivable and another credit facility, customarily a working capital facility, has a first lien on cash and accounts receivable and a second lien other assets. Agents on behalf of each credit facility customarily enter into an intercreditor agreement which sets forth each agent’s priority collateral and governs when among the two agents such agent may exercise certain rights and remedies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Second Lien Loans We structure our second lien investments as secured loans with a second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral serves as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. Second lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity, although there can be no assurance we will find investments providing for such amortization.
 Mezzanine Loans We structure our subordinated, or mezzanine investments, primarily as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that will provide us with current interest income. Generally, mezzanine loans rank subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt, and are often unsecured. However, mezzanine loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrowers’ capital structure. Mezzanine loans typically have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years and may include an associated equity component such as warrants, preferred stock or other similar securities. The warrants associated with mezzanine loans are typically detachable, which allows lenders to receive repayment of their principal on an agreed amortization schedule while retaining their equity interest in the borrower. Also, in some cases our mezzanine loans will be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. Typically, our mezzanine loans will have maturities of five to ten years. In determining whether a prospective mezzanine loan investment satisfies our investment criteria, we generally seek a high total return potential, although there can be no assurance we will find investments satisfying that criterion or that any such investments will perform in accordance with expectations.

Logan JV We have invested in Logan JV, which as of December 31, 2018 consisted of a portfolio of loans to 130 different borrowers in industries similar to the companies in our portfolio. Logan JV invests primarily in lower yielding broadly syndicated and directly originated debt securities that are secured by a first lien on some or all of the issuer’s assets, including traditional senior debt and any related revolving or similar credit facility. This is generally the same collateral as our senior secured loans. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—THL Credit Logan JV LLC” and the financial statements attached as an exhibit hereto.
 Investment Terms
 We tailor the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:

• | requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board under some circumstances or participation rights. The intention will be to craft strong and investor-friendly agreements with covenants, events of default, remedies and intercreditor agreements, if applicable, being an integral part of such documents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.
 Supervising
 Supervision of our investments involves employing active monitoring methods; and developing strong underlying management teams at each portfolio company.
 Monitoring
 We employ the use of board observation and/or information rights, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors, and detailed internally generated monitoring reports to actively monitor performance. Additionally, we have developed a monitoring template that promotes compliance with these standards and that is used as a tool to assess investment performance relative to plan.
 As part of the monitoring process, the Advisor assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and assigns each portfolio investment a score of a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
 The revised investment performance scores, or IPS, are as follows:
 1 – The portfolio investment is performing above our underwriting expectations.
 2 – The portfolio investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting. All new investments are initially scored a 2
 16

3 – The portfolio investment is operating below our underwriting expectations and requires closer monitoring. The company may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, principal or interest payments are generally not past due.
 4 – The portfolio investment is performing materially below our underwriting expectations and returns on our investment are likely to be impaired. Principal or interest payments may be past due, however, full recovery of principal and interest payments are expected.
 5 – The portfolio investment is performing substantially below expectations and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. The company is in payment default and the principal and interest payments are not expected to be repaid in full.
 For purposes of clarity, underwriting as referenced herein may be re-determined after the initial investment as a result of a transformative credit event or other material event whereby such initial underwriting is deemed by the Advisor to be no longer appropriate for the purpose of assessing investment performance relative to plan. For any investment receiving a score of a 3 or lower THL Credit Advisors will increase their level of focus and prepare regular updates for the investment committee summarizing current operating results, material impending events and recommended actions.
 Our Advisor monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment scores assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our investment valuation process, the Advisor and board of directors review these investment scores on a quarterly basis. Our average portfolio company investment score was 2.05 and 2.24 at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The following is a distribution of the investment scores of our portfolio investments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):

(e) | As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Investment Score “5”, based upon fair value, included $18.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, of loans to companies in which we also hold equity securities.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest will be collected. However, we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2018, we had loans on non-accrual status with an amortized cost basis of $38.0 million and a fair value of $18.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had loans on non-accrual status with an amortized cost basis of $56.3 million and fair value of $21.0 million. The decrease in loans on non-accrual status is attributable in part 
 17

to our exit of certain non-accrual loans. For additional information, please refer to the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Once a loan is placed on non-accrual, our Advisor takes steps to maximize recovery on our investment, including through restructuring or disposition of our positions. We record the reversal of any previously accrued income against the same income category reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 Investment Management Agreement
 THL Credit Advisors serves as our investment adviser. THL Credit Advisors is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, THL Credit Advisors manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to, THL Credit, Inc. The address of THL Credit Advisors is 100 Federal Street, 31st Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.
 Under the terms of our investment management agreement, THL Credit Advisors:
  
• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 THL Credit Advisors’ services under the investment management agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
 Pursuant to our investment management agreement, we pay THL Credit Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee.
 Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets payable quarterly in arrears on a calendar quarter basis. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, “gross assets” is determined without deduction for any liabilities. The base management fee is calculated based on the value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, THL Credit Advisors earned base management fees of $9.0 million, $10.4 million and $11.0 million, respectively, from us.
 Commencing April 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020, we’ve implemented certain changes to the terms of the base management fee calculation. Refer to the ‘Recent Developments’ section for further detail.
 Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income 
 We accepted the Advisor’s proposal to waive 100% of the incentive fees accrued for the period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018 (such waiver, “Incentive Fee Waiver”). Such waived incentive fees shall not be subject to recoupment. 
 Subsequently, we accepted the Advisor’s proposal to waive 100% of the incentive fees accrued for the period commencing on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2019. Such waived incentive fees shall not be subject to recoupment. Additionally, we accepted the Advisor’s proposal to reduce the incentive fee based on pre-incentive income to 17.5%. Refer to the ‘Recent Developments’ section for further detail.
 18

Commencing January 1, 2018, we accepted the Advisor’s proposal to calculate the incentive fee on net investment income in a manner intended to reduce the future amount of any incentive fees and more closely align our incentive fee arrangement with the performance of the Company. Below is a description of how we will calculate the Advisor’s incentive fee on net investment income under this new arrangement as well as a description of the calculation under the original arrangement.
 New Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income
 As of January 1, 2018, we have calculated the incentive fee on net investment income as indicated below (“Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income”) and waived such portion of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income that is in excess of the incentive fee on net investment income as set forth in the investment management agreement that the Advisor would otherwise be entitled to receive. In order to ensure that we will pay the Advisor less aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated beginning January 1, 2018, we have, at the end of each quarter, also calculated the incentive fee on net investment income owed by us to the Advisor based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018 to give effect to the waiver (“Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement”). If the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place since January 1, 2018, are greater than the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement, the Advisor shall only be entitled to the lesser of those two amounts. See Note 4 “Related Party Transactions” to our financial statements for the details of the calculation under the investment management agreement.
 Since January 1, 2018, the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income has been calculated by reference to the most recent trailing twelve quarter period or, if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2018 (“Trailing Twelve Quarter Period”), rather than on the standalone quarterly basis as set forth in the investment management agreement.  Specifically, the net investment income component was calculated, and payable, quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to our aggregate preincentive fee net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2018).  Preincentive fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount for incentive fee based on preincentive fee net investment income continues to be determined on a quarterly basis and equal to 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) but is multiplied by the net asset value attributable to our common stock at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters (also referred to as “minimum income level”). The hurdle amount will be calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all issuances by us of shares of our common stock, including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
 The calculation of preincentive fee net investment income continues to mean interest income, amortization of original issue discount, commitment and origination fees, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under our administration agreement (discussed below), and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any offering expenses and other expenses not charged to operations but excluding certain reversals to the extent such reversals have the effect of reducing previously accrued incentive fees based on the deferral of non-cash interest. Furthermore, preincentive fee net investment income continues to include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash.
 The incentive fee based on preincentive net investment income for each quarter is determined as follows:
  
• | The Investment Advisor receives no incentive fee for any calendar quarter in which our preincentive fee net investment income does not exceed the minimum income level.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19

 
• | Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap below, the Advisor receives 100% of our preincentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters with respect to that portion of the preincentive net investment income for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the minimum income level but is less than 2.5% (which is 10.0% annualized) (also referred to as the “catch-up” provision); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20.0% of our preincentive fee net investment income, if any, greater than 2.5% (10.0% annualized) for the Trailing Twelve Quarters.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The amount of the incentive fee on preincentive net investment income that is paid for a particular quarter equals the excess of the incentive fee so calculated minus the aggregate incentive fees on preincentive net investment income that were paid in respect of the eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the appropriate number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2018) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below).
 The foregoing incentive fee is subject to an Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below). The “Incentive Fee Cap” for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, minus (b) the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. “Cumulative Net Return” means (x) preincentive net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, we pay no incentive fee based on income to our Advisor for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee based on pre-incentive net investment income that is payable to our Advisor for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we pay an incentive fee based on preincentive net investment income to our Advisor equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee based on preincentive net investment income that is payable to our Advisor for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we pay an incentive fee based on income to our Advisor equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. “Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.
 For the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income is to reduce aggregate incentive fees payable to the Advisor by us, effective as of January 1, 2018. In order to ensure that we will pay the Advisor less aggregate fees on a cumulative basis we, at the end of each quarter, also calculate the incentive fee on net investment income owed by us to the Advisor based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018. If, at any time since January 1, 2018, the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place after January 1, 2018 after giving effect to the Incentive Fee Waiver, is greater than the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018, the Advisor is only entitled to the lesser of those two amounts until such time as the requisite number of stockholders approve such amended incentive fee calculation.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we would have incurred $2.6 million of incentive fees related to ordinary income under this calculation. These fees were greater on a cumulative basis than the fees calculated based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2018, therefore, the fees under the old formula were booked as an expense.

 Determination of Incentive Fee based on income
 In Quarter 1, the Ordinary Income of $6.0 million exceeds the Hurdle Amount of $2.0 million and the Catch-up Amount of $2.5 million. There are no Net Capital Losses. As a result, an Incentive Fee based on income of $1.2 million ((100% of $0.5 million) + (20% of $3.5 million)) is payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 1.
 In Quarter 2, the Quarter 2 Ordinary Income of $1.5 million does not exceed the Quarter 2 Hurdle Amount of $2.0 million, but the aggregate Ordinary Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $7.5 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $4.0 million and the aggregate Catch-up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $5.0 million. There are no Net Capital Losses. As a result, an Incentive Fee based on income of $300,000 ($1.5 million ((100% of $1.0 million) + (20% of 2.5 million)) minus $1.2 million paid in Quarter 1) is payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 2.
 In Quarter 3, the aggregate Ordinary Income of the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $9.5 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $6.0 million and the aggregate Catch-up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $7.5 million. However, there is an aggregate Net Capital Loss of ($4.0) million for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. As a result, the Incentive Fee Cap would apply. The Incentive Fee Cap equals $(0.4 million), calculated as follows:
 (20% x ($9.5 million minus $4.0 million)) minus $1.5 million paid in Quarters 1 and 2. Because the Incentive Fee Cap is a negative value, there is no Incentive Fee based on income payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 3.
 In Quarter 4, the aggregate Ordinary Income of the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $13.0 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $8.0 million and the aggregate Catch-up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $10.0 million. The calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income would be $1.1 million ($2.6 million (100% of $2.0 million) + (20% of $3.0 million) minus $1.5 million paid in Quarters 1 and 2). However, there is an aggregate Net Capital Loss of ($1.0) million for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. As a result, the Incentive Fee Cap would apply. The Incentive Fee Cap equals $900,000 calculated as follows:
 (20% x ($13.0 million minus $1.0 million)) minus $1.5 million. Because the Incentive Fee Cap is positive but less than the Incentive Fee based on income of $1.1 million calculated prior to applying the Incentive Fee Cap, an Incentive Fee based on income of $900,000 is payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 4.
 Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income Prior to the Fee Waiver Agreement
 The incentive fee has two components, ordinary income and capital gains, calculated as follows:
 The ordinary income component is calculated, and payable, quarterly in arrears based on our preincentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a cumulative total return requirement and to deferral of non-cash amounts. The preincentive fee net investment income, which is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to our common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will have a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate (also referred to as “minimum income level”). Preincentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and 
 22

consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under our administration agreement (discussed below), and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any offering expenses and other expenses not charged to operations but excluding certain reversals to the extent such reversals have the effect of reducing previously accrued incentive fees based on the deferral of non-cash interest. Preincentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. The Advisor receives no incentive fee for any calendar quarter in which our preincentive fee net investment income does not exceed the minimum income level. Subject to the cumulative total return requirement described below, the Advisor receives 100% of our preincentive fee net investment income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the preincentive net investment income for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the minimum income level but is less than 2.5% (which is 10.0% annualized) of net assets (also referred to as the “catch-up” provision) and 20.0% of our preincentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter, if any, greater than 2.5% (10.0% annualized) of net assets. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our preincentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20% of the amount by which our preincentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the “catch-up” provision, and (ii) (x) 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” is the amount, if positive, of the sum of our preincentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (sometimes referred to as payment-in-kind interest, or PIK, or original issue discount, or OID) will be paid to THL Credit Advisors, together with interest thereon from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate.
 Preincentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts. For example, if we receive preincentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.5% base management fee. These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to first component of incentive fee
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $0, $2.4 million and $4.5 million, net of incentive fees waived of $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $0, respectively, of incentive fees related to ordinary income. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of such incentive fees were currently payable to the Advisor. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively of incentive fees incurred by us were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK, certain discount accretion and deferred interest) and are not payable until such amounts are received in cash.
 Pre-incentive fee capital gains allocated to second component of incentive fee
 The second component of the incentive fee (capital gains incentive fee) is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement, as of the termination date). This component is equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and cumulative aggregate unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year. The aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees is subtracted from such capital gains incentive fee calculated. There was no capital gains incentive fee payable to our Advisor under the investment management agreement as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
 Payment of our expenses
 All investment professionals and staff of THL Credit Advisors, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us; and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services (including health insurance, 401(k) plan benefits, payroll taxes and other compensation related matters), are provided and paid for by THL Credit Advisors.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We reimburse THL Credit Advisors for a portion of the costs and expenses incurred by THL Credit Advisors for office space rental, office equipment and utilities deemed allocable to the performance by THL Credit Advisors of its duties under the investment management agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by THL Credit Advisors relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by THL Credit Advisors to us or in the form of managerial assistance to portfolio companies that request it.
 THL Credit Advisors may pay amounts owed by us to third party providers of goods or services. We will subsequently reimburse THL Credit Advisors for such amounts paid on our behalf.
 Limitation of liability and indemnification
 The investment management agreement provides that THL Credit Advisors and its officers, directors, employees and affiliates are not liable to us or any of our stockholders for any act or omission by it or its employees in the supervision or management of our investment activities or for any loss sustained by us or our stockholders, except that the foregoing exculpation does not extend to any act or omission constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations under the investment management 
 25

agreement. The investment management agreement also provides for indemnification by us of THL Credit Advisors’ members, directors, officers, employees, agents and control persons for liabilities incurred by it in connection with their services to us, subject to the same limitations and to certain conditions.
 Duration and termination
 The investment management agreement was approved by our board of directors on March 5, 2019, as described further below under “Business—Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement.” Unless terminated earlier as described below, it will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The investment management agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The investment management agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. Any termination by us must be authorized either by our board of directors or by vote of our stockholders. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business.” We are dependent upon senior management personnel of our investment adviser for our future success, and if our investment adviser is unable to retain qualified personnel or if our investment adviser loses any member of its senior management team, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.
 Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
 At a meeting of our Board of Directors held on March 5, 2019, our board of directors unanimously voted to approve the investment advisory agreement. In reaching a decision to approve the investment advisory agreement, the board of directors reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things:

• | the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by THL Credit Advisors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the fee structures of comparable externally managed business development companies that engage in similar investing activities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to business development companies with similar investment objectives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any existing and potential sources of indirect income to THL Credit Advisors from its relationship with us and the profitability of that relationship, including through the investment advisory agreement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the investment advisory agreement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the organizational capability and financial condition of THL Credit Advisors and its affiliates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | various other matters.
--+-----------------------

 Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, the board of directors, including all of the directors who are not “interested persons” as defined in the 1940 Act, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the investment advisory agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.
 Administration Agreement
 We have entered into an administration agreement with THL Credit Advisors, which we refer to as the “administration agreement,” under which the Administrator provides administrative services to us. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs.
 26

The Administrator may pay amounts owed by us to third-party providers of goods or services. We will subsequently reimburse the Administrator for such amounts paid on our behalf.
 Additionally, at our request, the Administrator provides on our behalf significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.
 License Agreement
 We and THL Credit Advisors have entered into a license agreement with THL Partners under which THL Partners has granted to us and THL Credit Advisors a non-exclusive, personal, revocable worldwide non-transferable license to use the trade name and service mark THL, which is a proprietary mark of THL Partners, for specified purposes in connection with our respective businesses. This license agreement is royalty-free, which means we are not charged a fee for our use of the trade name and service mark THL. The license agreement is terminable either in its entirety or with respect to us or THL Credit Advisors by THL Partners at any time in its sole discretion upon 60 days prior written notice, and is also terminable with respect to either us or THL Credit Advisors by THL Partners in the case of certain events of non-compliance. After the expiration of its first one year term, the entire license agreement is terminable by either us or THL Credit Advisors at our or its sole discretion upon 60 days prior written notice. Upon termination of the license agreement, we and THL Credit Advisors must cease to use the name and mark THL, including any use in our respective legal names, filings, listings and other uses that may require us to withdraw or replace our names and marks. Other than with respect to the limited rights contained in the license agreement, we and THL Credit Advisors have no right to use, or other rights in respect of, the THL name and mark. We are an entity operated independently from THL Partners, and third parties who deal with us have no recourse against THL Partners
Staffing
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Our Advisor and Administrator have hired and expect to continue to hire professionals with skills applicable to our business plan and investment objective, including experience in middle market investment, leveraged finance and capital markets. Each of our executive officers is an employee and executive officer of our Advisor or its wholly owned subsidiary, THL Credit Senior Loan Strategies LLC (“SLS”). Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Advisor. The services necessary for the origination and administration of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by either the Advisor or SLS. Our Advisor’s investment professionals focus on origination and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments. We reimburse the Advisor, in its capacity as our Administrator, for costs and expenses incurred by our Administrator for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to our Administrator under the administration agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by our Advisor relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by our Advisor to us. In addition, we reimburse our Administrator for our allocable portion of expenses it incurs in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs.
Material Conflicts of Interest
 We entered into an investment management agreement on April 1, 2010 under which the Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. The Advisor and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. For example, the Advisor may serve as investment adviser to one or more private funds or registered closed-end funds, and presently serves as an investment adviser to certain CLOs and THL Credit Senior Loan Fund (NYSE: TSLF), a closed-end fund. In addition, our officers may serve in similar capacities for one or more private funds or registered closed-end funds. The Advisor’s policies are designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities if we are able to co-invest, either pursuant to SEC interpretive positions or an exemptive order, with other funds managed by the Adviser and its affiliates. In addition, we note that any 
 27

affiliated fund currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Advisor or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. However, in certain instances due to regulatory, tax, investment, or other restrictions, certain investment opportunities may not be appropriate for either us or other funds managed by the Advisor.
 The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. Unless otherwise provided in the allocation policy, if an investment opportunity is appropriate for both us and other investment funds and the investment opportunity requires more than the price to be negotiated, the investment opportunity will be made available to the other investment fund or us on an alternating basis based on the date of closing of each such investment opportunity and each fund’s available capital. As a result, the Advisor and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Although the Advisor and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates.
 On September 19, 2018 the SEC granted us the relief we sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates (“Affiliated Funds”) and, subject to certain conditions, proprietary accounts of the Advisor or its affiliates (“THL Proprietary Accounts”) or  in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds and/or THL Proprietary Accounts if, among other things, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) or our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
 Business Development Company Regulations
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act.
 In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities” as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if (1) our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and (2) our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 7, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to sell up to 25% of our common stock at a price below our then-current net asset value per share, subject to approval by our board of directors for the offering. The authorization expires on the earlier of June 7, 2019 or the date of our 2019 Annual Meeting of 
 28

Stockholders, which is expected to be held in June 2019. Our stockholders also approved a proposal to authorize us to offer and issue debt with warrants or debt convertible into shares of our common stock at an exercise or conversion price that, at the time such warrants or convertible debt are issued, will not be less than the market value per share but may be below our then-current net asset value per share.
 As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might indirectly subject our stockholders to additional expenses as they will indirectly be responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without stockholder approval.
 Qualifying assets
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
  
• | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company substantially owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfies either of the following:
--+-----------------------------------


• | has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 29

 
• | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company.
 Significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies
 A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Business—Business Development Company Regulations—Qualifying assets” above. Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
 Temporary investments
 Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. Consequently, repurchase agreements are functionally similar to loans. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, the 1940 Act and certain diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. Our investment Advisor monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
 Warrants and Options
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our board of directors approves such issuance on the basis that the 
 30

issuance is in the best interests of THL Credit and its stockholders and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
 Senior securities
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks related to our operations as a BDC.”
 No-action relief from registration as a commodity pool operator
 We are relying on a no-action letter (the “No-Action Letter”) issued by the staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) as a basis to avoid registration with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”). The No-Action Letter allows an entity to engage in CFTC-regulated transactions (“commodity interest transactions”) that are “bona fide hedging” transactions (as that term is defined and interpreted by the CFTC and its staff), but prohibit an entity from entering into commodity interest transactions if they are non-bona fide hedging transactions, unless immediately after entering such non-bona fide hedging transaction (a) the sum of the amount of initial margin deposits on the entity’s existing futures or swaps positions and option or swaption premiums does not exceed 5% of the market value of the entity’s liquidating value, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such transactions, or (b) the aggregate net notional value of the entity’s commodity interest transactions would not exceed 100% of the market value of the entity’s liquidating value, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such transactions. We are required to operate pursuant to these trading restrictions if we intend to continue to rely on the No-Action Letter as a basis to avoid CPO registration.
 Proxy voting policies and procedures
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to THL Credit Advisors. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of THL Credit Advisors are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by THL Credit Advisors and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
 Introduction
 THL Credit Advisors is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, THL Credit Advisors has fiduciary duties to us. As part of this duty, THL Credit Advisors recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. THL Credit Advisors’ Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures have been formulated to ensure decision-making consistent with these fiduciary duties.
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.

Proxy policies
 THL Credit Advisors evaluates routine proxy matters, such as proxy proposals, amendments or resolutions on a case-by-case basis. Routine matters are typically proposed by management and THL Credit Advisors will normally support such matters so long as they do not measurably change the structure, management control, or operation of the corporation and are consistent with industry standards as well as the corporate laws of the state of incorporation.
 THL Credit Advisors also evaluates non-routine matters on a case-by-case basis. Non-routine proposals concerning social issues are typically proposed by stockholders who believe that the corporation’s internally adopted policies are ill-advised or misguided. If THL Credit Advisors has determined that management is generally socially responsible, THL Credit Advisors will generally vote against these types of non-routine proposals. Non-routine proposals, to the extent they occur, concerning financial or corporate issues are usually offered by management and seek to change a corporation’s legal, business or financial structure. THL Credit Advisors will generally vote in favor of such proposals provided the position of current stockholders is preserved or enhanced. Non-routine proposals concerning stockholder rights are made regularly by both management and stockholders. They can be generalized as involving issues that transfer or realign board or stockholder voting power. THL Credit Advisors typically would oppose any proposal aimed solely at thwarting potential takeovers by requiring, for example, super-majority approval. At the same time, THL Credit Advisors believes stability and continuity promote profitability. THL Credit Advisors’ guidelines in this area seek a middle road and individual proposals will be carefully assessed in the context of their particular circumstances.
 If a vote may involve a material conflict of interest, prior to approving such vote, THL Credit Advisors must consult with its chief compliance officer to determine whether the potential conflict is material and if so, the appropriate method to resolve such conflict. If the conflict is determined not to be material, THL Credit Advisors’ employees shall vote the proxy in accordance with THL Credit Advisors’ proxy voting policy.

 Code of ethics
 We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and we have also approved our investment adviser’s code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 of the Advisers Act. These codes establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. Our code of ethics and our code of ethics and business conduct are available on our corporate governance webpage at http://investor.thlcreditbdc.com/corporate-governance.
Privacy Principles
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
 32

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to our investment adviser’s employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders.
 Compliance with Corporate Governance Regulations
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 In addition, The NASDAQ Global Select Market has adopted various corporate governance requirements as part of its listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 Other
 We have adopted an investment policy that mirrors the requirements applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act.
 We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act.
 We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 We and THL Credit Advisors have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and will review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We and THL Credit Advisors have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available to the public on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
 Our internet address is www.thlcreditbdc.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
 Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our taxable earnings and profits. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain 
 33

source of income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).
 Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
 If we:
  
• | maintain our qualification as a RIC; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,
--+---------------------------------------------

 then generally we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
 In order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
  
• | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or currencies (the “90% Income Test”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute each calendar year in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for such calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We may choose to retain a portion of our ordinary income and/or capital gain net income in any year and pay the 4% U.S. federal excise tax on the retained amounts. For federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Certain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable entities are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries.
 34

Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement, which is necessary to maintain our RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy our RIC distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our RIC distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise qualify for the dividends received deduction or constitute qualified dividend income as ineligible for such treatment, (2) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (3) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (4) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (5) cause us to recognize income or gain without receipt of a corresponding distribution of cash, (6) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (7) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (8) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions, but there can be no assurance that any adverse effects of these provisions will be mitigated.
