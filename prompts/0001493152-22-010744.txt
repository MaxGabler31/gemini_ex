ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Ezagoo Limited, a Nevada corporation (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 9, 2018.
 
Beijing Ezagoo Zhicheng Internet Technology Limited (“BEZL”) is the Company through which we operate, and which shares our business plan to provide video advertising on buses and the mobile application named “Xindian” that is developed by the Company. Prior to December 31, 2016, Beijing Ezagoo Zhicheng Internet Technology Limited (“BEZL”) was initially a startup stage company engaged in e-commerce, offering electronics products for sale such as, but not limited to, mobile phones, tablets and related accessories. Due to continued losses from their e-commerce business activities, and high competition in the industry, BEZL discontinued all e-commerce business activities and sold off any remaining inventories relating to such e-commerce activities. Following December 31, 2016, the Company adopted its current business plan.
 
At present, the Company operates within the Chinese digital advertising network through advertisements displayed on flat-panel audiovisual television displays located on the vast network of urban bus lines in Changsha City and the mobile application named “Xindian” that was launched on October 2020.
 
Our TV audio visual advertising network displayed on the rented buses, provides an opportunity for brands to break through the advertising clutter and effectively reach a large audience of bus passengers. Through our special media portal (digital TV Screen advertising), we help connect sellers with buyers and ultimately reach their ideal target audiences. We anticipate a growing need for our services in Mainland China because of our ability to provide access to a wide range of consumers at cost effective prices. In today’s complex corporate landscape there is an increasing need for enterprises, in all industries, to maximize their performance and profitability while keeping costs low. We believe that our competitive fees, will provide us with a competitive advantage over our competitors and lead to increased demand for our services.
 
The Company’s primary business activity is to display advertisements for its clients on TV screens mounted on public buses that operate in Changsha City, and the mobile application named “Xindian” that operate over the internet. The advertisements were displayed solely on 22-inch audiovisual screens that are mounted behind the bus driver’s seat, with speakers placed throughout the buses so that all passengers on the bus are able to both watch and hear advertisements. This placement of screens and speakers will ensure that all passengers inside the bus are subjected to advertisements of our clients throughout the full duration of their bus journey.
 
1600 screens in 500 buses run 10 hours daily while buses are traveling within Changsha City. To date, there are three main kinds of bus advertising promotion, consisting of the following:
 

● | A majority of advertisements are displayed on bus TV screen which are broadcast repeatedly approximately 20 times per day in a 15-minute cycle. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Bus advertisements are highly visible and are displayed daily while the buses travel along the same routes daily, offering advertisers massive impact and high frequency to targeted audiences. With 10 hours of uninterrupted TV audiovisual display, quality ready-made video commercials advertisements maximize the exposure of bus audiences during their daily journeys. The TV screen promotion of brand, products and services can be undertaken using a wide range of bus TV channels in several different bus lines while offering a chance to directly reach bus passengers living in different areas throughout the city. Additionally, through the bus’s background system, the TV display flashes upcoming bus-stop information along with various ads on the TV screens. This ensures that passengers often look at the screen to grasp information about the next stop while they are exposed to the brand messages and advertisements of our clients. This grants advertisers the assurance it is highly likely that their message will be seen by the consumers.
 

● | Some bus advertisements allow brands to directly target desirable passengers travelling along a specific bus route. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Certain advertisements may be of more interest to, and thus be considered more effective, when directed to specific consumer groups. Furthermore, due to the nature of the bus advertisements we offer we can place advertisements along certain bus routes, for example on a bus travelling from a residential location to a commercial hub. This allows advertisers to display their message in front of viewers who are more likely to have an interest in their products or services. This is a highly targeted and cost-effective way for brand clients to reach their ideal consumer groups. It is the belief of the Company that this could produce higher consumer recall rate of ads than when those same ads are displayed randomly.

● | Bus TV screens can also set a time slot and allow the advertising content to be updated remotely over a WIFI connection. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have the ability to plan campaigns and focus on consumers at specific times of the day by scheduling a time segment during which specific advertisements will play. This can also be further customized by selecting certain bus lines on which to display client advertisements. If appropriate, we could coordinate advertising campaigns so that only one, or perhaps several, commercial brands are placed on TV screens of each bus or specific bus line. This would allow these clients to guarantee their advertisement will be seen in a certain timeslot and physical location, granting them an advantage over potential competitors. Advertisements scheduled to run during commuter traffic, for example, could generate far more leads than at other, less congested, times of day. Our bus TV display background system enables access to independently monitor and adjust performance, frequency and playback times of advertisements daily on each bus. These TV screens can display a fully customized range of content such as ads, videos, promotional content, news, sports, etc. for passengers. Additionally, this system enables us to upload new advertisements anywhere and anytime with 3G/ 4G or Wi-Fi connection.
 
Standard Advertisement Pricing
 

We’re going to focus on the Xindian platform since Januray 1, 2022, according to the announcement of <Approval of Changsha Municipal People’s Government on establishing Changsha Bus Group Co., LTD.> that was issued by the Changsha government on November 17, 2020, “In order to accelerate the development of the Changsha City, the local government decided to set up the Changsha Public Transportation Group Ltd, which holds Baojun Bus Co., Zhongwang Bus Co., and Tongchang Bus Co..” These mentioned Bus companies are used to be our vendors, our contracts with Zhongwang Bus Co., and Tongchang Bus Co., were expired on February 9, 2021, and April 1, 2020, respectively, and our contract were not renewed due to the merger agreement by Changsha Government and the Bus Companies. The contract with Baojun Bus Co., was expired on December 31, 2020 but we continued the bus rent on a monthly basis until December 28, 2021. The Changsha government completed the merge and acquisition at the end of 2021, which makes it very difficult for us to continue to operate in this area.


The Xindian platform is relying on strong R&D background to build a technology based on block chain, fusion merchants and user needs in the integration of social short video platform, that provides many functions, such as self-service advertising, sharing and creating short video, making money in space time, selling goods online and shopping, social networking. We aim to build an innovative service platform for industrial clusters. We focus on medical beauty and anti-aging scale that differentiate us from another short video platform.
 
According to the MobData, the number of medical cosmetology users in China reached 18.073 million. Among them, the users of medical beauty and anti-aging are about 64.36%, which can be estimated the number of users of medical beauty and anti-aging market in China in 2021 will be 11.63 million. In addition, according to the comprehensive calculation of user scale and consumer unit price of various medical beauty & anti-aging projects, the marker scale of medical beauty and anti-aging in China will exceed 75.5 billion yuan in 2021. The market of medical beauty and anti-aging is in the growing stage, and we believe the medical anti-aging projects in the future will become the mainstream. We will strictly control the medical beauty agency, the qualification of beauty technology, to provide and build a reliable, transparent, comprehensive medical beauty related community, that helps users to improve the medical beauty knowledge and decision-making efficiency, thus promote the rapid development platform.
 
Marketing Plan
 
We expect to increase our marketing efforts through our President’s personal networks and industry association channels which have not, at this point in time, been fully identified. Additionally, we intend to bolster our professional reputation and image by showcasing our knowledge and industry expertise via marketing campaigns through various forms of media. We have undefined plans to initially market our services through webinars, the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information offerings. Furthermore, we plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. A targeted campaign is intended to be made to focus on start-ups and small to mid-size companies in various industries.
Competition
 
We compete primarily with several different groups of competitors:
 

● | Advertising companies that operate public transport advertising companies, especially Bus line advertising networks, such as Bus Online Co. Ltd. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Out-of-home digital advertising networks beyond the Bus Line sector, such as Focus Media; 
● | Other advertising media companies, such as Internet, street furniture displays, billboards, and with traditional advertising media, such as newspapers, television, magazines and radio, some of which may advertise on the Buses in which we have exclusive contract rights to operate digital TV screens. 

 
The digital advertising industry our company operates in is extremely competitive and there are limited barriers to entry, thus new competitors frequently enter the market. We believe that existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive pricing and performance characteristics. In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to attract new customers, or maintain prices, which would likely reduce market share. Sales and overall profitability could be reduced in either case.

Future Plans
 
In accordance with the overall Amiba transformation strategy of the Company in 2022, we have been further upgraded in the development direction of the project, with one Xindian Platform and three directions, Xin Beauty, Xin Food, Xin Farm, to build a health industry chain. It is our goal to optimize the efficiency of city services and connect to residents by creating the online advertising network in China. We aim to be a promoter and participator of a ‘health beauty’ concept. At present, we solely focus on Changsha city, but in the future, we plan to allocate funds to integrate advertisement, Xindian platform and new communication technology regionally. And we expect to reach more than 500 million users on our platform and expand to 300 cities throughout Mainland China in the next three to five years.
 
However, without an appropriate budget and intensive research, plans referring to development, expansion, potential unidentified acquisitions and concrete timescales cannot be determined at present.
