Overview
 Capital Senior Living Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), is one of the largest operators of senior housing communities in the United States in terms of resident capacity. The Company and its predecessors have provided senior housing since 1990. As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 129 senior housing communities in 23 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents, including 83 senior housing communities which the Company owned and 46 senior housing communities the Company leased. During 2017, approximately 94.4% of total revenues for the senior housing communities operated by the Company were derived from private pay sources.
 The Company’s operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services. Many of the Company’s communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents’ needs as they change over time by integrating independent living, assisted living, and memory care, and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies, sustaining residents’ autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities.

Industry Background
 The senior living industry encompasses a broad and diverse range of living accommodations and supportive services that are provided primarily to persons 75 years of age or older.
 For the elderly who require limited services, independent living residences supplemented at times by home health care, offers a viable option. Most independent living communities typically offer community living packaged with basic services consisting of meals, housekeeping, laundry, 24-hour staffing, transportation, social and recreational activities and health care monitoring. Independent living residents typically are not reliant on assistance with activities of daily living (“ADLs”) although some residents may contract out for those services.
 As a senior’s need for assistance increases, care in an assisted living residence is often preferable and more cost-effective than home-based care or nursing home care. Typically, assisted living represents a combination of housing and support services designed to aid elderly residents with ADLs such as ambulation, bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, personal hygiene and monitoring or assistance with medications. Certain assisted living residences may also provide assistance to residents with low acuity medical needs, or may offer higher levels of personal assistance for incontinent residents or residents with Alzheimer’s disease or other cognitive or physical frailties. Generally, assisted living residents require higher levels of care than residents of independent living residences and retirement living centers, but require lower levels of care than patients in skilled nursing facilities. For seniors who need the constant attention of a skilled nurse or medical practitioner, a skilled nursing facility may be required.
 According to the American Seniors Housing Association, Seniors Housing Construction Monitor – Winter 2018 Report, as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, 21.0% of the age-restricted seniors housing supply in the United States were assisted living units, 22.6% were independent living units, 49.8% were nursing care units, and 6.6% were memory care units.

The senior living industry is highly fragmented and characterized by numerous small operators. Moreover, the scope of senior living services varies substantially from one operator to another. Many smaller senior living providers do not operate purpose-built residences, do not have extensive professional training for staff and provide only limited assistance with ADLs. The Company believes that many senior living operators do not provide the required comprehensive range of senior living services designed to permit residents to “age in place” within the community as residents develop further physical or cognitive frailties. The Company believes that as one of the nation’s largest operators it has scale and resources that provide it with certain competitive advantages.
 The Company believes that a number of demographic, regulatory and other trends will contribute to the continued growth in the senior living market, including the following:
 Consumer Preference
 The Company believes that senior housing communities are increasingly becoming the setting preferred by prospective residents and their families for the care of the elderly. Senior living offers residents greater independence and allows them to “age in place” in a residential setting, which the Company believes results in a higher quality of life than that experienced in more institutional or clinical settings.
 The likelihood of living alone increases with age. Most of this increase is due to an aging population in which women outlive men. Societal changes, such as high divorce rates and the growing numbers of persons choosing not to marry, have further increased the number of Americans living alone. This growth in the number of elderly living alone has resulted in an increased demand for services that historically have been provided by a spouse, other family members or live-in caregivers.
 Demographics
 The primary market for the Company’s senior living services is comprised of persons aged 75 and older. This age group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population. The older population itself is increasingly older. In 2011, the 75-84 age group in the United States (12.8 million persons) was 16 times larger than in 1900 and the 85 and over age group in the United States (5.7 million persons) was 40 times larger. The 85 and over population in the United States is projected to more than double from 5.7 million persons in 2011 to 14.1 million persons in 2040. As the number of persons aged 75 and older continues to grow, the Company believes that there will be corresponding increases in the number of persons who need assistance with ADLs.
Senior Affluence
 The average net worth of senior citizens is typically higher than non-senior citizens, partially as a result of accumulated equity through home ownership. The Company believes that a substantial portion of the senior population has historically accumulated significant resources available for their retirement and long-term care needs. The Company’s target population is comprised of moderate to upper income seniors who have, either directly or indirectly through familial support, the financial resources to pay for senior housing communities, including an assisted living alternative to traditional long-term care.
Reduced Reliance on Family Care
 Historically, the family has been the primary provider of care for seniors. The Company believes that the increase in the percentage of women in the work force, the reduction of average family size, and overall increased mobility in society is reducing the role of the family as the traditional caregiver for aging parents. The Company believes that these factors will make it necessary for many seniors to look outside the family for assistance as they age.

Restricted Supply of Nursing Beds
 Several states in the United States have adopted Certificate of Need (“CON”) or similar statutes generally requiring that, prior to the addition of new skilled nursing beds, the addition of new services, or the making of certain capital expenditures, a state agency must determine that a need exists for the new beds or the proposed activities. The Company believes that this CON process tends to restrict the supply and availability of licensed nursing facility beds. High construction costs, limitations on government reimbursement, and start-up expenses also act to constrain growth in the supply of such facilities. At the same time, nursing facility operators are continuing to focus on improving occupancy and expanding services to sub-acute patients generally of a younger age and requiring significantly higher levels of nursing care. As a result, the Company believes that there has been a decrease in the number of skilled nursing beds available to patients with lower acuity levels and that this trend should increase the demand for the Company’s senior housing communities, including, particularly, the Company’s assisted living communities.
 Cost-Containment Pressures
 In response to rapidly rising health care costs, governmental and private pay sources have adopted cost containment measures that have reduced admissions and encouraged reduced lengths of stays in hospitals and other acute care settings. Private insurers have begun to limit reimbursement for medical services in general to predetermined charges, and managed care organizations (such as health maintenance organizations) are attempting to limit hospitalization costs by negotiating for discounted rates for hospital and acute care services and by monitoring and reducing hospital use. In response, hospitals are discharging patients earlier and referring elderly patients, who may be too sick or frail to manage their lives without assistance, to nursing homes and assisted living residences where the cost of providing care is typically lower than hospital care. In addition, third-party payors are increasingly becoming involved in determining the appropriate health care settings for their insureds or clients, based primarily on cost and quality of care. Based on industry data, the typical day-rate in an assisted living facility is one-fourth of the cost for comparable care in a nursing home and two-thirds of the cost of living at home with a third party home health care provider.
 Operating Strategy
 The Company’s operating strategy is to provide value to its senior living residents by providing quality senior living services at reasonable prices, while achieving and sustaining a strong, competitive position within its geographically concentrated regions, as well as continuing to enhance the performance of its operations. The Company is implementing its operating strategy principally through the following methods:
Provide a Broad Range of Quality Personalized Care
 Central to the Company’s operating strategy is its focus on providing quality care and services that are personalized and tailored to meet the individual needs of each community resident. The Company’s residences and services are designed to provide a broad range of care that permits residents to thrive and “age in place” as their needs change and as they develop further physical or cognitive frailties. By creating an environment that maximizes resident autonomy and provides individualized service programs, the Company seeks to attract seniors at an earlier stage, before they need the higher level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility. The Company also maintains a comprehensive quality assurance program designed to ensure the satisfaction of its residents and their family members. The Company conducts annual resident satisfaction surveys that allow residents at each community to express whether they are “very satisfied,” “satisfied” or “dissatisfied” with all major areas of a community, including, housekeeping, maintenance, activities and transportation, food service, security and management. In each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company achieved 94.6% overall approval ratings from the residents’ satisfaction surveys. In addition, the Company ranked third among senior living operators nationally in 2018 according to J.D. Powers 2018 Senior Living Satisfaction Study.  The study measured resident and family overall satisfaction across factors important to them including community staff, convenience of location, food and beverage, room, building and grounds, senior service and activities among others.

Offer Services Across a Range of Pricing Options
 The Company’s range of products and services is continually expanding to meet the evolving needs of its residents. The Company has developed a menu of products and service programs that may be further customized to serve both the moderate and upper income markets of a particular targeted geographic area. By offering a range of pricing options that are customized for each target market, the Company believes that it can develop synergies, economies of scale and operating efficiencies in its efforts to serve a larger percentage of the elderly population within a particular geographic market.
Improve Occupancy Rates
 The Company continually seeks to maintain and improve occupancy rates by: (i) retaining residents as they “age in place” by extending optional care and service programs and converting existing units to higher levels of care; (ii) attracting new residents through the use of technology to enhance Internet marketing and on-site marketing programs focused on residents and family members; (iii) selecting communities in underserved markets; (iv) aggressively seeking referrals from senior care referral services, professional community outreach sources, including area religious organizations, senior social service programs, civic and business networks, as well as the medical community; and (v) continually refurbishing and renovating its communities.
Improve Operating Efficiencies
 The Company seeks to improve operating efficiencies at its communities by actively monitoring and managing operating costs and by moving to a more centralized operating platform. By having an established portfolio of communities in geographically concentrated regions throughout the United States with regional management in place, the Company believes it has established a platform to achieve operating efficiencies through economies of scale in the purchase of bulk items, such as food and supplies, and in the spreading of fixed costs, such as corporate overhead, over a larger revenue base, and to provide more effective management supervision and financial controls. The Company’s growth strategy includes acquiring additional communities within our geographically concentrated regions to achieve further efficiencies.
Emphasize Employee Training and Retention
 The Company devotes special attention to the hiring, screening, training, supervising and retention of its employees and caregivers to ensure that quality standards are achieved. In addition to normal on-site training, the Company conducts national management meetings and encourages sharing of expertise among managers. The Company has also implemented a comprehensive online training program that addresses the specific challenges of working within the senior living environment. The Company’s commitment to the total quality management concept is emphasized throughout its training programs. This commitment to the total quality management concept means identification of the “best practices” in the senior living market and communication of those “best practices” to the Company’s executive directors and their staff. The identification of best practices is realized by a number of means, including: emphasis on regional and executive directors keeping up with professional trade publications; interaction with other professionals and consultants in the senior living industry through seminars, conferences and consultations; visits to other properties; leadership and participation at national and local trade organization events; and information derived from marketing studies and resident satisfaction surveys. This information is continually processed by regional managers and the executive directors and communicated to the Company’s employees as part of their training. The Company hires an executive director for each of its communities and provides them with autonomy, responsibility and accountability. The Company’s staffing of each community with an executive director allows it to hire more professional employees at these positions, while the Company’s developed career path helps it to retain the professionals it hires. The Company believes its commitment to and emphasis on employee training and retention differentiates the Company from many of its competitors.

Senior Living Services
 The Company provides senior living services to the elderly, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services. By offering a variety of services and encouraging the active participation of the resident and the resident’s family and medical consultants, the Company is able to customize its service plan to meet the specific needs and desires of each resident. Additionally, the Company is actively working to expand service offerings through conversions of existing units to higher levels of care. As a result, the Company believes that it is able to maximize customer satisfaction and avoid the high cost of delivering unnecessary services to residents.
 The Company’s operating philosophy is to provide quality senior housing communities and services to senior citizens and deliver a continuum of care for its residents as their needs change over time coordinated with third party post-acute care providers. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care services and is bridged by home care, sustains residents’ autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities. As residents age, in many of the Company’s communities, they are able to obtain the additional services they need within the same community, avoiding the disruptive and often traumatic move to a different facility.
 Independent Living Services
 The Company provides independent living services to seniors who typically do not yet need assistance or support with ADLs, but who prefer the physical and psychological comfort of a residential community that offers health care and other services. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 40 communities and leased 15 communities that provide independent living services, which include communities that combine assisted living and other services, with an aggregate capacity for approximately 6,900 residents.
 Independent living services provided by the Company include daily meals, transportation, social and recreational activities, laundry, housekeeping and 24-hour staffing. The Company also fosters the wellness of its residents by offering access to health screenings (such as blood pressure checks), periodic special services (such as influenza inoculations), dietary and similar programs, as well as ongoing exercise and fitness classes. Classes are given by health care professionals to keep residents informed about health and disease management. Subject to applicable government regulation, personal care and medical services are available to independent living residents through either the community staff or through the Company’s agency or other independent home care agencies. The Company’s independent living residents pay an average fee of $2,800 per month, in general, depending on the specific community, program of services, size of the unit and amenities offered. The Company’s contracts with its independent living residents are generally for a term of one year and are typically terminable by either party, under certain circumstances, upon providing 30 days’ notice unless state law stipulates otherwise.
 Assisted Living Services
 The Company offers a wide range of assisted living care and services, including personal care services, 24-hour staffing, support services, and supplemental services. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 67 communities and leased 40 communities that provide assisted living services, which include communities that combine independent living and other services, with an aggregate capacity for approximately 9,600 residents. The residents of the Company’s assisted living residences generally need help with some or all ADLs, but do not require the more acute medical care traditionally given in nursing homes. Upon admission to the Company’s assisted living communities, and in consultation with the resident, the resident’s family and medical consultants, each resident is assessed to determine his or her health status, including functional abilities and need for personal care services. The resident also completes a lifestyles assessment to determine the resident’s preferences. From these assessments, a care plan is developed for each resident to ensure that all staff members who render care meet the specific needs and preferences of each resident where possible. Each resident’s care plan is reviewed periodically to determine whether a change in care is needed.

The Company has adopted a philosophy of assisted living care that allows a resident to maintain a dignified independent lifestyle. Residents and their families are encouraged to be partners in the residents’ care and to take as much responsibility for their well-being as possible. The basic types of assisted living services offered by the Company include the following:
 Personal Care Services. These services include assistance with ADLs such as ambulation, bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, personal hygiene, and monitoring or assistance with medications.
 Support Services. These services include meals, assistance with social and recreational activities, laundry services, general housekeeping, maintenance services and transportation services.
 Supplemental Services. These services include extra transportation services, personal maintenance, extra laundry services, and special care services, such as services for residents with certain forms of dementia. Certain of these services require extra charges.
 The Company’s assisted living residents pay an average fee of $4,000 per month, in general, depending on the specific community, the level of personal care services, support service and supplemental services provided to the resident, size of the unit and amenities offered. The Company’s contracts with its assisted living residents are generally for a term of one year and are typically terminable by either party, under certain circumstances, upon providing 30 days’ notice unless state law stipulates otherwise.
 Memory Care Services
 The Company maintains programs and special units at some of its communities for residents with certain forms of dementia, which provide the attention, care and services needed to help those residents maintain a higher quality of life. Specialized services include assistance with ADLs, behavior management and life skills-based activities programs, the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents’ remaining functional abilities. Special units for residents with certain forms of dementia are located in a separate area of the community and have their own dining facilities, resident lounge areas, and specially trained staff. The special care areas are designed to allow residents the freedom to ambulate as they wish, while keeping them safely contained within a secure area with a minimum of disruption to other residents. Resident fees for these special units are dependent on the size of the unit, the design type and the level of services provided.
 The Company’s memory care residents pay an average fee of $5,200 per month, in general, depending on the specific community, the level of personal care services, support service and supplemental services provided to the resident, size of the unit and amenities offered. The Company’s contracts with its memory care residents are generally for a term of one year and are typically terminable by either party, under certain circumstances, upon providing 30 days’ notice unless state law stipulates otherwise.
 Home Care Services
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company made home care services available to clients at a majority of its senior housing communities through third-party providers. The Company believes that the provision of private pay, home care services is an attractive adjunct to its independent living services because it allows the Company to make available more services to its residents as they age in place and increases the length of stay in the Company’s communities. In addition, the Company makes available to residents certain customized physician, dentistry, podiatry and other health-related rehabilitation and therapy services that may be offered by third-party providers.

Growth Strategies
 The Company believes that the fragmented nature of the senior living industry and the limited capital resources available to many small, private operators provide an attractive opportunity for the Company to expand its existing base of senior living operations. The Company believes that its current operations with geographic concentrations throughout the United States serve as the foundation on which the Company can build senior living networks in targeted geographic markets and thereby provide a broad range of high quality care in a cost-efficient manner.
 The following are the principal elements of the Company’s clear and differentiated growth strategy:
 Organic Growth
 The Company intends to continue to focus on its occupancy, rents and operating margins of its stabilized communities. The Company continually seeks to improve occupancy rates and increase average rents by: (i) retaining residents as they “age in place” by extending optional care and service programs and converting existing units to higher levels of care; (ii) attracting new residents through the use of technology to enhance Internet marketing and on-site marketing programs focused on residents and family members; (iii) aggressively seeking referrals from senior care referral services, professional community outreach sources, including area religious organizations, senior social service programs, civic and business networks, as well as the medical community; and (iv) continually refurbishing and renovating its communities.
Expansion and Conversions of Existing Communities
 The Company intends to increase levels of care and capacity at certain of its existing communities through expansion and/or conversions of certain units. Increasing our levels of care and capacity is expected to increase revenue and operating income while meeting the needs of our residents who have an average age of 85 years.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
 The Company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of senior housing communities. Through strategic acquisitions, joint venture investments, or facility leases, the Company seeks to acquire communities in existing geographically concentrated regions as a means to increase market share, augment existing clusters, strengthen its ability to provide a broad range of care, and create operating efficiencies. As the industry continues to consolidate, the Company believes that opportunities will arise to acquire other senior living companies. The Company believes that the current fragmented nature of the senior living industry, combined with the Company’s financial resources, geographically concentrated regions, and extensive contacts within the industry, should provide it with the opportunity to evaluate a number of potential acquisition opportunities in the future. In reviewing acquisition opportunities, the Company will consider, among other things, geographic location, competitive climate, reputation and quality of management and communities, and the need for renovation or improvement of the communities.
Expand Referral Networks
 The Company intends to continue to develop relationships with local and regional hospital systems, managed care organizations and other referral sources to attract new residents to the Company’s communities. In certain circumstances these relationships may involve strategic alliances or joint ventures. The Company believes that such arrangements or alliances, which could range from joint marketing arrangements to priority transfer agreements, will enable it to be strategically positioned within the Company’s markets if, as the Company believes, senior living programs become an integral part of the evolving health care delivery system.

Operations
 Centralized Management
 The Company centralizes its corporate and other administrative functions so that the community-based management and staff can focus their efforts on resident care. The Company maintains centralized accounting, finance, human resources, training and other operational functions at its national corporate office in Dallas, Texas. The Company also has a corporate office in New York, New York. The Company’s corporate offices are generally responsible for: (i) establishing Company-wide policies and procedures relating to, among other things, resident care and operations; (ii) performing accounting functions; (iii) developing employee training programs and materials; (iv) coordinating human resources; (v) coordinating marketing functions; and (vi) providing strategic direction. In addition, financing, development, construction and acquisition activities, including feasibility and market studies, and community design, development, and construction management are conducted at the Company’s corporate offices.
 The Company seeks to control operational expenses for each of its communities through proprietary expense management systems, standardized management reporting and centralized controls of capital expenditures, asset replacement tracking, and purchasing for larger and more frequently used supplies and food inventories through group purchasing programs. Community expenditures are monitored by regional and district managers who are accountable for the resident satisfaction and financial performance of the communities in their region.
 Regional Management
 The Company provides oversight and support to each of its senior housing communities through experienced regional and district managers. A district manager will generally oversee the marketing and operations of three to seven communities clustered in a small geographic area. A regional manager will generally cover a larger geographic area consisting of eight to thirteen communities. In most cases, the district and regional managers will office out of the Company’s senior housing communities. Currently, there are district and regional managers based in the East, Central Plains, South Central, Dallas, Indiana, Midwest, Texas, Southwest, and West regions.
 The executive director at each community reports to a regional or district manager. The regional and district managers report on the operations of each community directly to senior management at the Company’s corporate office. The district and regional managers make regular site visits to each of their assigned communities. The site visits involve a physical plant inspection, quality assurance review, staff training, financial and systems audits, regulatory compliance, and team building.
 Community-Based Management
 An executive director manages the day-to-day operations at each senior housing community, including oversight of the quality of care, delivery of resident services, and monitoring of financial performance. The executive director is also responsible for all personnel, including food service, maintenance, activities, security, assisted living, housekeeping, and, where applicable, nursing or care services. In most cases, each community also has department managers who direct the environmental services, nursing or care services, business management functions, dining services, activities, transportation, housekeeping, and marketing functions.
 The assisted living component of the senior housing communities is managed by licensed professionals, such as a nurse and/or a licensed administrator. These licensed professionals have many of the same operational responsibilities as the Company’s executive directors, but their primary responsibility is to oversee resident care. Many of the Company’s senior housing communities are part of a campus setting, which may include independent living and/or memory care. This campus arrangement allows for cross-utilization of certain support personnel and services, including administrative functions that result in greater operational efficiencies and lower costs than freestanding facilities.
 The Company actively recruits personnel to maintain adequate staffing levels at its existing communities and hires new staff for new or acquired communities prior to opening. The Company has adopted comprehensive recruiting and screening programs for management positions that utilize corporate office team interviews and thorough background and reference checks. The Company offers system-wide training and orientation for all of its employees at the community level through a combination of Company-sponsored seminars and conferences.
 12


Quality Assurance
 Quality assurance programs are coordinated and implemented by the Company’s corporate and regional staff. The Company’s quality assurance is targeted to achieve maximum resident and resident family member satisfaction with the care and services delivered by the Company. The Company’s primary focus in quality control monitoring includes routine in-service training and performance evaluations of caregivers and other support employees. The Company has established a Corporate Quality Assurance Committee which consists of the Executive Vice-President, Senior Vice-President, and Vice-President of Operations, Quality and Clinical Directors, and General Counsel. The purpose of the committee is to monitor and evaluate the processes by which care is delivered to our residents and the appropriateness and quality of care provided within each of our communities. Additional quality assurance measures include:
 Resident and Resident’s Family Input.     On a routine basis, the Company provides residents and their family members the opportunity to provide valuable input regarding the day-to-day delivery of services. On-site management at each community has fostered and encouraged active resident councils and resident committees who meet independently. These resident bodies meet with on-site management on a monthly basis to offer input and suggestions as to the quality and delivery of services. Additionally, at each community the Company conducts annual resident satisfaction surveys to further monitor the satisfaction levels of both residents and their family members. These surveys are sent directly to a third party firm for tabulation, then to the Company’s corporate headquarters for distribution to onsite staff. In each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company achieved 94.6% approval ratings from its residents. For any departmental area of service scoring below 90%, a corrective action plan is developed jointly by on-site, regional and corporate staff for immediate implementation. In addition, the Company ranked third among senior living operators nationally in 2018 according to J.D. Powers 2018 Senior Living Satisfaction Study.  The study measured resident and family overall satisfaction across factors important to them including community staff, convenience of location, food and beverage, room, building and grounds, senior service and activities among others.
 Regular Community Inspections.     Each community is inspected, on at least a quarterly basis, by regional and/or corporate staff. Included as part of this inspection is the monitoring of the overall appearance and maintenance of the community interiors and grounds. The inspection also includes monitoring staff professionalism and departmental reviews of maintenance, housekeeping, activities, transportation, marketing, administration and food and health care services, if applicable. The inspections also include observing residents in their daily activities and the community’s compliance with government regulations.
 Independent Service Evaluations.     The Company engages the services of outside professional independent consulting firms to evaluate various components of the community operations. These services include mystery shops, competing community analysis, pricing recommendations and product positioning. This provides management with valuable unbiased product and service information. A plan of action regarding any areas requiring improvement or change is implemented based on information received. At communities where health care is delivered, these consulting service reviews include the on-site handling of medications, recordkeeping and general compliance with all applicable governmental regulations.
Sales and Marketing
 Most communities are staffed by on-site sales directors and additional marketing/sales staff depending on the community size and occupancy status. The primary focus of the on-site marketing staff is to create awareness of the Company and its services among prospective residents and family members, professional referral sources and other key decision makers. These efforts incorporate an aggressive marketing plan to include monthly, quarterly and annual goals for leasing, new lead generation, prospect follow up, community outreach and resident and family referrals. Additionally, the marketing plan includes a calendar of promotional events and a comprehensive media program. On-site marketing departments perform a competing community assessment quarterly. 

13


Corporate and regional sales directors monitor the on-site sales departments’ effectiveness and productivity on a weekly basis. Routine detailed marketing department audits are performed on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary. Corporate and regional personnel assist in the development of marketing strategies for each community to address the continuously changing resident profile and maintain a focus on building brand awareness and increasing Internet website traffic and leads. The marketing strategies developed utilize the implementation of application program interface systems with certain website and Internet referral partners and the production of creative media and necessary marketing collateral. The Company has also implemented numerous Internet web-based initiatives to attract prospects including certain e-mail and website triggers prompting interactive invitations with on-going follow-ups, as well as a nurturing program to actively engage prospects throughout the marketing/sales cycle. Ongoing sales training of on-site marketing/sales staff is implemented by corporate and regional marketing directors as well as third party professionals.
 Government Regulation
 Changes in existing laws and regulations, adoption of new laws and regulations, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could have a material effect on the Company’s operations. Failure by the Company to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Accordingly, the Company monitors legal and regulatory developments on local and national levels.
 The health care industry is subject to extensive regulation and frequent regulatory change. At this time, no federal laws or regulations specifically regulate assisted or independent living residences. While a number of states have not yet enacted specific assisted living regulations, certain of the Company’s assisted living communities are subject to regulation, licensing, CON and permitting by state and local health care and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. While such requirements vary from state to state, they typically relate to staffing, training, physical design, patient privacy, required services and the quality thereof and resident characteristics. The Company believes that such regulation will increase in the future. In addition, health care providers are receiving increased scrutiny under anti-trust laws as integration and consolidation of health care delivery increases and affects competition. Moreover, robust state and federal enforcement of fraud and abuse laws continues. Because some of the Company’s communities receive a portion of their funds from Medicaid, such communities are also subject to state and federal Medicaid standards, the noncompliance with which may result in the imposition of penalties or sanctions or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicaid program. The Company’s communities are also subject to various zoning restrictions, local building codes, and other ordinances, such as fire safety codes. Failure by the Company to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regulation of the assisted living industry is evolving. The Company is unable to predict the content of new regulations and their effect on its business. There can be no assurance that the Company’s operations will not be adversely affected by regulatory developments.
 The Company believes that its communities are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi-annually, or following a regulator’s receipt of a complaint about a community. In the ordinary course of business, one or more of the Company’s communities could be cited for deficiencies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed upon plan of corrective action relating to the community’s operations, but the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community, which could result in the imposition of fines, repayment of amounts previously paid, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our loan or lease agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers’ or facilities’ history of compliance. We may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole. In addition, states’ Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living communities even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds.
 14


Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional federal, state and local laws exist that also may require modifications to existing and planned properties to permit access to the properties by disabled persons. While the Company believes that its communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements or are exempt therefrom, if required changes involve a greater expenditure than anticipated or must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, additional costs would be incurred by the Company. Further legislation may impose additional burdens or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons, the costs of compliance with which could be substantial.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), in conjunction with the federal regulations promulgated thereunder by the Department of Health and Human Services, has established, among other requirements, standards governing the privacy and security of certain protected and individually identifiable health information that is created, received or maintained by a range of covered entities. HIPAA has also established standards governing uniform health care transactions, the codes and identifiers to be used by the covered entities and standards governing the security of certain electronic transactions conducted by covered entities. Penalties for violations can range from civil money penalties for errors and negligent acts to criminal fines and imprisonment for knowing and intentional misconduct. In addition, the Company may be subject to a corrective action plan, the cost of compliance of which could be significant.
 In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances could be substantial and the liability of an owner or operator as to any property is generally not limited under such laws and regulations and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the owner or operator. The presence of these substances or failure to remediate such contamination properly may also adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral. Under these laws and regulations, an owner, operator or an entity that arranges for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, such as asbestos-containing materials, at a disposal site may also be liable for the costs of any required remediation or removal of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site. In connection with the ownership or operation of its properties, the Company could be liable for these costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties. The Company has completed Phase I environmental audits of substantially all of the communities in which the Company owns interests, typically at the time of acquisition, and such audits have not revealed any material environmental liabilities that exist with respect to these communities.
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability with respect to any of its owned, leased or managed communities that the Company believes would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company believes that its communities are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. The Company has not been notified by any governmental authority, and is not otherwise aware of any material non-compliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of the communities the Company currently operates.
 The Company believes that the structure and composition of government and, specifically, health care regulations will continue to change and, as a result, regularly monitors developments in the law. The Company expects to modify its agreements and operations from time to time as the business and regulatory environments change. While the Company believes it will be able to structure all its agreements and operations in accordance with applicable law, there can be no assurance that its arrangements will not be successfully challenged.

15


Competition
 The senior living industry is highly competitive, and the Company expects that all segments of the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. Although there are a number of substantial companies active in the senior living industry and in the markets in which the Company operates, the industry continues to be very fragmented and characterized by numerous small operators. The Company primarily competes with national operators such as Brookdale Senior Living Inc. and Five Star Quality Care, Inc. and other regional and local independent operators. The Company believes that the primary competitive factors in the senior living industry are: (i) quality on-site staff; (ii) location; (iii) reputation for and commitment to a high quality of service; (iv) support service offerings (such as food services); (v) fair price for services provided; and (vi) physical appearance and amenities associated with the communities. The Company competes with other companies providing independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing, home health care, and other similar service and care alternatives, some of whom may have greater financial resources than the Company. Because seniors tend to choose senior housing communities near their homes, the Company’s principal competitors are other senior living and long-term care communities in the same geographic areas as the Company’s communities. The Company also competes with other health care businesses with respect to attracting and retaining nurses, technicians, aides and other high quality professional and non-professional employees and managers.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed 7,426 persons (101 of whom are employed at the Company’s corporate offices), of which 4,413 were full-time employees and 3,013 were part-time employees. None of the Company’s employees are currently represented by a labor union and the Company is not aware of any union organizing activity among its employees. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
