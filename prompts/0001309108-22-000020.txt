Additionally, WEX Bank is a depository partner for WEX Inc., who is a non-bank custodian, for certain custodial HSA cash assets.
General Developments in 2021
Below are certain developments that we believe are material to an understanding of the general development of our business during 2021.
Notes Redemption
On February 11, 2021, the Company provided irrevocable notice to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., of its intent to redeem its outstanding $400 million 4.75 percent senior secured notes due February 1, 2023. On March 15, 2021, the Company redeemed such senior secured notes outstanding for a redemption price of $400 million plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On April 1, 2021, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the 2016 Credit Agreement. As part of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to (i) increase

commitments under the Company’s secured revolving credit facility from $870.0 million to $930.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) provide additional senior secured tranche A term loans (the “Tranche A Term Loans”) resulting in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans equal to $978.4 million, (iii) re-establish the senior secured tranche B term loans’ aggregate principal amount at $1,442.0 million (the “Tranche B Term Loans”), (iv) eliminate the 0.75 percent eurocurrency rate floor with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, and (v) make certain other changes to the previously existing 2016 Credit Agreement, including without limitation, (a) extending the maturity dates for the Tranche A Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility to April 1, 2026 and the maturity date for the Tranche B Term Loans to April 1, 2028, (b) providing additional flexibility with respect to certain negative covenants, prepayments and other provisions of the Company’s previously existing 2016 Credit Agreement, and (c) revising the Company’s maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for all future quarters. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement gives the Company greater financial flexibility and liquidity. 
Non-Bank Custodianship and HSA Fund Investments
On April 1, 2021, WEX Inc. completed the acquisition of certain contractual rights to serve as custodian or sub-custodian to certain HSAs from the HealthcareBank division of Bell Bank, which is owned by State Bankshares, Inc. As a result, and as of the time of the acquisition, WEX Inc. became the passive non-bank custodian of over $3 billion of custodial assets for individual HSA holders. This acquisition increases the Company’s role in its customer-directed healthcare ecosystem and aligns with its growth strategy. On the closing of the acquisition, WEX Inc. paid Bell Bank initial cash consideration of $200.0 million. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, WEX Inc. agreed to make an additional deferred cash payment of $25.0 million in July 2023 and a second additional deferred cash payment of $25.0 million in January 2024. As of June 1, 2021, in connection with the acquisition by WEX Health of Cirrus Holdings, LLC further discussed below, the second deferred payment of $25.0 million was reduced by the amount of $12.5 million (the “Payment Offset”). As a result of the Payment Offset, WEX Inc. continues to owe Bell Bank $12.5 million for the second additional deferred cash payment, which is due and payable in January 2024. The purchase agreement also includes potential additional consideration payable annually that is calculated on a quarterly basis and is contingent, and based, upon any future increases in the Federal Funds rate. The contingent payment period began on July 1, 2021 and shall extend until the earlier of (i) the year ending December 31, 2030, or (ii) the date when the cumulative amount paid as contingent consideration equals $225 million. 
WEX Inc. has contracted with federally insured bank depository partners, including WEX Bank, to hold these custodial cash assets on behalf of its members. On October 14, 2021, WEX Inc. transferred $960 million of the eligible custodial cash assets previously held by third-party depository partners to WEX Bank as a depository partner. Assets held by WEX Bank can be and have been invested in various fixed income securities in accordance with WEX Bank’s investment policy and applicable FDIC regulations. 
Acquisition of remaining interest in WEX Europe Services 
On April 13, 2021, the Company both entered into a share purchase agreement for, and consummated the acquisition of, the remaining interest in WEX Europe Services it did not own previously, which consisted of 25 percent of the issued ordinary share capital, for a purchase price of $97.0 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company now owns 100 percent of the issued ordinary share capital of WEX Europe Services, which operates part of our European Fleet business. This transaction further streamlines the European Fleet business in order to create revenue synergies and manage the associated cost structure. 
benefitexpress Acquisition
Table of Contents

On June 1, 2021, WEX Inc.’s subsidiary, WEX Health, completed the acquisition of Cirrus Holdings, LLC, the indirect owner of Benefit Express Services, LLC, which is a provider of highly configurable, cloud-based benefits administration technologies and services doing business under the name benefitexpress (the “benefitexpress Acquisition”). The transaction expanded the Company’s role in the healthcare ecosystem, bringing together benefit administration, compliance services, and consumer-directed health and lifestyle spending accounts to form a full-service benefits marketplace. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive purchase agreement, WEX Health consummated the benefitexpress Acquisition for total consideration of approximately $275 million, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. WEX Inc. indirectly owns 95.47 percent of WEX Health. For further information regarding the structure of the benefitexpress Acquisition refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Executive Leadership Team Reorganization
To enable us to better serve our customers and integrate our solutions and operations across the Company’s expansive platform, we recently re-organized our Executive Leadership Team. As part of the reorganization, which was effective January 1, 2022, Robert Deshaies was appointed Chief Operating Officer, Americas. In this newly created role, Mr. Deshaies will oversee the strategic growth of, and collaboration across the Company’s fleet, health, travel and corporate payments businesses in the Americas with the goal of creating expansive and fully integrated customer relationships by offering a one-touch experience across the Company’s entire product portfolio. In addition, effective January 3, 2022, Carlos Carriedo was appointed the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, International and will oversee WEX’s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) and Karen Stroup was appointed the Company’s Chief Digital Officer, and will focus on expanding digital commerce and product development opportunities.
The segment discussion following, and included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within this Annual Report on 10-K, reflects information about our business as of and through December 31, 2021. 
FLEET SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Fleet Solutions segment is a leader in fleet vehicle payment processing, transaction processing and information management services specifically designed for the needs of fleets of all sizes from small businesses to federal and state government fleets and over-the-road carriers. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 17 million vehicles used our solutions for fleet management.
Solution 
Payment processing transactions are the primary revenue source in Fleet Solutions. Revenue is earned based on a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of the customer’s purchase, a fixed amount per transaction, or a combination of both. In a typical domestic payment processing transaction for which we extend short-term credit to the fleet cardholder, we pay the merchant for the purchase price, less the fees we retain and record as revenue, according to their specific merchant agreement, which generally occurs within ten days. Revenue from our WEX Europe Services and Go Fuel Card operations is primarily derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. In both types of transactions, we collect the total purchase price from the fleet customer, normally within 25 days from the billing date.
The following illustration1 depicts our business process for a typical closed-loop North American fleet domestic fuel payment processing transaction and a breakdown of how the revenue derived therefrom relates to Fleet Solutions revenue streams.
Table of Contents

1 Illustration assumes payment method via fleet card, however, payment may be initiated by card, chip, cell phone application and/or onboard computer.
In our over-the-road business, the amount of time between when we pay the merchants and collect from our customers is significantly reduced relative to the illustration above. Additionally, there are instances in which WEX processes a fleet customer transaction, with the merchant bearing the credit risk and collecting the receivable from the fleet. These unfunded transactions represented approximately 18 percent of total fuel transactions processed. 
At the point-of-sale, we capture an array of information. Examples of information captured, which varies by type of customer, includes the amount of the expenditure, the driver, the vehicle, the odometer reading, the fuel or vehicle maintenance provider and the items purchased. We provide standard and personalized information to customers through monthly vehicle analysis reports, custom reports and our websites. We also alert customers of unusual transactions or transactions that fall outside of pre-established parameters. Customers can access their account information through our website including account history and recent transactions and download the related details. In addition, fleet managers can elect to be notified when limits are exceeded in specified purchase categories, including limits on transactions within a time range and gallons per day. 
In the over-the-road space, we offer fleets of all sizes customizable payment solutions including real-time interactive and seamless interfaces delivering data integrity, alternative payment and money transfer options, comprehensive settlement solutions, real-time reports and analytics for compliance and cost-optimization and fuel reconciliation and mobile optimization tools.
In addition to revenue derived from payment processing transactions, we recognize account servicing revenue, finance fee revenue and other revenue through the following products and services: 
•Customer service, account activation and account retention: We offer around the clock customer service, account activation and account retention services to fleets, fleet management companies and the fuel and vehicle maintenance providers on our network. Our services include promoting the adoption and use of our products and programs and account retention programs on behalf of our customers and partners. 
•Authorization and billing inquiries and account maintenance: We handle authorization and billing questions, account changes and other issues for fleets through our dedicated customer contact centers, which are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fleet customers also have self-service options available to them through our websites. 
•Account management: We assign designated account managers to businesses and government agencies with large fleets. These representatives have in-depth knowledge of both our programs and the operations and objectives of the fleets they service. 
•Credit and collections services: We have developed proprietary account approval, credit management and fraud detection programs. Our underwriting model produces a proprietary score, which we use to predict the likelihood of an account becoming delinquent at application and on an ongoing basis. We have developed a collections scoring model that we use to rank and prioritize past due accounts for collection activities. We also employ fraud specialists who monitor accounts, alert customers and provide case management expertise to minimize losses and reduce program abuse. 
Table of Contents

•Merchant services: Our representatives work with fuel and vehicle maintenance providers to enroll these providers in our network, to test all network and terminal software and hardware, and to provide training on our sale, transaction authorization and settlement processes. 
•Analytics solutions: We provide customers with access to web-based data analytics platforms and custom reporting tools that offer insights to fleet managers, including integrating and analyzing business fleet fuel purchases to uncover fraud, manage product type controls and identify cost saving opportunities. 
•Ancillary services and offerings: We provide a variety of ancillary services and tools to fleets to help them better manage expenses and capital requirements including tracking driver performance, location and speed; mobile account maintenance and payment tools; tax reporting and permitting services.
Distribution 
We market our fleet products and services both directly and indirectly to commercial and government vehicle fleet customers with small, medium and large fleets, and over-the-road, long haul fleets. Our direct product suite includes payment processing and transaction processing services, WEX branded fleet cards in North America and Motorpass/Motorcharge-branded fleet cards in Australia. Additionally, the WEX products and services are marketed under the EFS, EFS Transportation Services, T-Chek and Fleet One network brands. 
We also market our products and services using the WEX network indirectly through co-branded and private label relationships. With a co-branded relationship product, we market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel providers and fleet management companies using their brand names and our logo on a co-branded fleet card. These companies seek to offer our payment processing and information management services as a component of their total offering to their fleet customers. 
Our private label programs market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel retailers, using only their brand names. The fuel retailers with which we have formed strategic relationships offer our payment processing and information management products and services to their fleet customers in order to establish and enhance customer loyalty. These fleets use these products and services to purchase fuel at locations of the fuel retailer with whom we have the private label relationship. 
TRAVEL AND CORPORATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment focuses on the complex payment environment of global B2B payments. Our capabilities and solutions broadly fall into two categories:
•Embedded Payments. Our primary service offering is to enable customers to utilize our highly scalable, and vertically integrated payments solutions to integrate into their own workflows. Customers access our capabilities primarily via application programming interface (API). We combine wholly-owned and developed cloud-based technology along with our wholly-owned and operated global financial services capabilities, inclusive of WEX Bank and our various electronic money institutions around the world, to satisfy the commercial payments needs of our customer base.
•Accounts Payable (AP) Automation and Spend Management. Built on top of our embedded payment capabilities, our AP Automation and Spend Management capabilities provide an enhanced user interface and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software integration points for organizations to manage their AP Automation and Spend Management functions. Our solutions in this space address corporations of all sizes and are white-labeled by leading financial institutions. 
Solution    
The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment allows businesses to centralize purchasing, simplify complex supply chain processes, and eliminate the paper check writing associated with traditional purchase order programs. It also enables technology companies and innovators across the globe to streamline their payment needs with a single, integrated technology and issuing partner.
Table of Contents

At the core of our Travel and Corporate Solutions product set is a virtual card. Our virtual payments capability is used for transactions where no physical card is presented, including transactions that are increasingly completed online in a digitally connected world, but can also be used over the telephone, by mail, by email, or by fax. Each transaction is assigned a unique VCN on either the Mastercard or Visa networks, with a customized spend limit, expiration date, and various other purchase controls. These controls are in place to limit fraud and unauthorized spending. The unique VCN limits purchase amounts and tracks, settles, and reconciles purchases more easily, creating efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. Our virtual card solution combines (i) wholly-owned, end-to-end highly reliable technology; (ii) global currency capabilities with over 20 currencies active, (iii) wholly-owned global compliance and funding mechanism that allows WEX to be the issuer in addition to the payment processor, and (iv) being a direct member of both the Mastercard and Visa networks. 
We surround our core virtual card capabilities with a set of additional solution features to serve our customers. For our Embedded Payments solution, these capabilities include: (i) customized data fields that allow customers to tie together data such as invoice numbers, booking numbers, or purchase orders that ease reconciliation, (ii) a wide variety of different virtual card products with each of the card associations to optimize card acceptance and interchange yield, (iii) bank transfer and check issuance capabilities, (iv) modern, RESTful API, with associated, developer-focused explanation of use, and (v) the ability to optimize our systems and processes for bespoke solutions to large customer needs. For our AP Automation and Spend Management solution, these capabilities include: (i) customizable integrations with different ERPs, (ii) enhanced AP data analysis and supplier enablement teams focused on increasing card acceptance, (iii) a wide variety of different virtual card products with each of the card associations to optimize card acceptance and interchange yield, (iv) bank transfer and check issuance capabilities allowing WEX to fulfill full AP file needs, and (v) different user interfaces oriented toward more simple small business needs as well as complex corporate needs.
Distribution 
We market our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment products and services both directly and indirectly to new and existing customers in a variety of models.
Within our Embedded Payments solutions, we focus on direct sales to leading companies in the travel, fintech, insurance, consumer bill pay, and media verticals. Our customers’ product set is largely focused on aggregating and managing large amounts of payments where a commercial payment solution is required. The use of a commercial virtual card is particularly appealing for its ability to easily reconcile, provide chargeback rights, have global currency capabilities, and generate rebates through interchange economics. Due to their inability to stand in the funds flow, either as a merchant of record or as a regulated money transmitter, a minority of customers who utilize our Embedded Payments offering also integrate our capability for us to have a direct financial relationship with their customers, and most often includes the provision of commercial credit.
Within our AP Automation and Spend Management solutions, we focus on both direct sales to businesses as well as empowering financial institutions to serve their customers directly on the back of our technology. Our direct sales team focuses on new sales directly to mid- and large- market opportunities where our custom ERP integration and supplier enablement functions help corporations turn their AP function from a highly manual and costly endeavor to a highly automated and revenue generating function. Our direct sales force also focuses on cross selling our AP Automation and Spend Management solutions to existing customers in our Fleet Solutions and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segments. Our AP Automation and Spend Management solutions are made to be white labeled for financial institutions and we power some of the world’s leading financial institutions offering our white labeled technology to their corporate customers.
HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment provides a SaaS platform for consumer directed healthcare benefits and a full-service benefit enrollment solution, bringing together benefits administration, certain compliance services and consumer-directed and benefits accounts. Additionally, the Company provides non-bank custodial services to certain HSA assets.
Solution
Our healthcare products provide consumer-directed benefits in the complex healthcare market. We partner with employers, health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies and the public sector to provide a 
Table of Contents

SaaS product to support healthcare benefit programs, to administer COBRA, flexible spending, health saving and reimbursement accounts, enrollment, benefits administration and compliance services, as well as non-bank custodial services for HSAs. 
Revenue is generated primarily from SaaS licensing fees and servicing fees charged to partners and employers as well as interchange fees on customer debit cards issued under flexible spending, health savings and reimbursement accounts. Cards are branded with either Visa or Mastercard and operate on a restricted open loop network.
The following illustration depicts our business process and parties involved in our healthcare benefits solution:
BPO: Business Process Outsourcing
Distribution 
We market our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions products and services to consumers through an extensive partner network, which includes health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies benefits consultants, and software providers, as well as individual employer groups.
OTHER ITEMS 
Markets 
We face competition in all of our segments. Our competitors vie with us for prospective customers as well as for companies with which to form strategic relationships. The most significant competitive factors include the breadth of features offered, functionality, servicing capability and price. We compete with companies that perform payment and transaction processing or similar services. Financial institutions that issue Visa, Mastercard and American Express credit and specialized proprietary cards currently compete primarily with our Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments. Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment also competes with other healthcare payment service providers, as well as benefits administration services providers.
Table of Contents

The demand for our products and services combined with significant operating scale has historically driven strong revenue growth and earnings potential. We have an extensive history of organic revenue growth driven by our various marketing channels, our salesforce, and our growth in transaction volume and other recurring drivers (for example, number of fuel cardholders or software platform participants within our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment). Further, we have completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings, which have contributed to our revenue growth and diversification of our products and services. We have an experienced and committed management team that has substantial industry knowledge and a proven track record of financial success. The team has been successful in driving strong growth with consistent operating performance. We believe that our management team positions us well to continue successfully implementing our growth strategy and capturing operating efficiencies. In addition, we believe that the following factors, by reportable segment, distinguish us from our competitors and place us in a strong competitive position.
Fleet Solutions
•Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks in the U.S. and Australia are among the largest in each country. We describe our fleet payment processing networks as “closed-loop” because we have a direct contractual relationship with both the merchant and the fleet, and only WEX transactions can be processed on these networks. We have built networks that management estimates provide coverage to over 90 percent of fuel locations in the U.S. and Australia, as well as wide acceptance in Europe. This provides our customers with the convenience of broad acceptance.
•Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks provide us with access to a higher level of fleet-specific information and control as compared to what is typically available on an open-loop network. This provides high-level purchase controls at the point-of-sale, including the flexibility of allowing fleets to restrict purchases and receive automated alerts. Additionally, we have the ability to refine the reporting provided to our fleet customers and customers of our strategic relationships.
•We offer a differentiated set of products and services, including security and purchase controls, to allow our customers and the customers of our strategic relationships to better manage their vehicle fleets. We provide customized analysis and reporting on the efficiency of fleet vehicles and the purchasing behavior of fleet vehicle drivers. We make this data available to fleet customers through both traditional reporting services and sophisticated web-based data analytics tools. 
•Our long-standing strategic relationships, multi-year contracts and high contract renewal rates have contributed to the stability and recurring nature of our revenue base. We believe that we offer a compelling value to our customers relative to our competitors given the breadth and quality of our products and services and our deep understanding of our customers’ operational needs. We have a large installed customer base and co-branded strategic relationships with some of the largest U.S. fleet management providers and with various oil companies and convenience store operators that use our private label solutions. Our wide site acceptance, together with our private-label portfolios and value-added product and service offerings, drive high customer satisfaction levels, as evidenced by high customer retention rates. 
•Our digital marketing services help increase sales leads and build loyalty for their branded card programs, thereby increasing average usage and spend on those programs.
•Our capabilities in the over-the-road market space enhance our ability to serve fleet customers who operate both heavy duty trucks and cars or light duty vehicles in the U.S. and Canada as well as to blend the small fleet and private label businesses for greater scale.
•Our European commercial fuel card programs, which use a closed-loop network, combined with long term supply agreements to serve the current and future European Fleet business, provide us with a strong foundation in the large European fleet market.
•As our customers transition to mixed-fleets of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs, we are increasingly deploying integrated solutions to help them manage end-to-end reporting and payment needs. Our current offering, in partnership with a leading charging network operator, includes en-route, depot and at-home charging solutions, streamlined program enrollment, centralized reporting and billing, and real-time data to support reimbursement and installation services. 
Travel and Corporate Solutions
•WEX has one of the widest arrays of commercial payments technologies available in the marketplace today - from integrated payables applications, to card processing, to modern API-driven embedded payments offerings, to merchant 
Table of Contents

receivables gateways. Our solutions are highly customizable, can be white-labeled, and are built for scale and resilience to meet the unique needs of our global customers and partners. 
•With our modern API solutions, WEX provides scale and stability to help our fintech and payments technology partners fully streamline their end-to-end payment processes. Because WEX platforms process millions of transactions for some of the world’s largest B2B payments aggregators and OTAs, the immediate scalability of our technology platforms represents a continued source of competitive advantage.
•Our solutions offer our partners and direct clients with enhanced security and controls across their complex and global payment activities. As WEX also provides technology solutions to major financial institutions, we ensure that our proprietary payment gateway solutions and internal information security protocols make transaction processing both highly scalable and secure. Our customizable authorization controls bring audit controls and security to global B2B virtual card transactions.
•WEX offers one of the strongest ranges of global commercial card issuing capabilities available in the market today. As of December 31, 2021, we settle transactions in over 20 currencies in more than 200 countries and territories across the world. The broad coverage and diversity of financial capabilities is a key source of differentiation for WEX, and is critical to delivering on the promise of global reach that our travel and corporate payments customers demand. 
•Our strategic relationships include an extremely diverse set of client and partner relationships - across buyers, suppliers, networks, and corporations of all sizes. WEX is one of the largest issuers of commercial cards and integrated payments solutions in the world, and as such, benefits from significant economies of scale across areas of pricing, cost, processing, network co-investment, and supplier enablement.
•WEX’s commercial payments expertise, across issuing, acquiring, carded, and non-carded payment types, enables us to react quickly to evolving market and customer needs. WEX’s payments experts have a deep understanding of the global payments marketplace and we leverage that expertise to help our clients and partners unlock the hidden value in their payments flows. 
Health and Employee Benefit Solutions
•The U.S. Health business uses an industry leading proprietary cloud-based platform to simplify healthcare benefits administration for partners, employers and consumers. We also provide employer and consumer services, such as claims processing and a call center, on either a WEX-branded or fully white-labeled basis. For employers, this means simplified benefits administration. For consumers, this means a personalized, intuitive experience that helps them maximize their benefits to improve their health and financial wellness. For partners, this means high-value benefit offerings powered by the WEX benefits platform and expert guidance to grow their business.
•We provide a comprehensive suite of products and services that can be customized to fit the needs of the complex healthcare space. WEX offers technology and solutions that meet employers’ end-to-end benefits needs, help employees get the most value from their benefit plans, and power partners’ benefit offerings and business growth. Our products and services, which fall under the four broad categories of payment processing, benefit analytics, data integration and security, include employee benefits administration and enrollment outsourcing, consumer-directed health and lifestyle spending account administration, COBRA administration and compliance services, and direct billing and payment solutions. As a result of this complete solution, which distinguishes us from competitors, we have high customer retention rates. 
•We have one of the industry’s largest benefits databases. Using our benefit analytics, partners, consultants, brokers, and employers can continually refine their offerings to optimize engagement, usage, and cost savings. In addition, we provide responsive service via phone, email, live chat and around-the-clock chatbot virtual assistance.
•WEX is an industry leader in bringing benefit administration, compliance services, and consumer-directed health and lifestyle accounts together to form a full-service benefits solution. While others may excel in one area, WEX has proven solutions to offer across the spectrum of employer benefits needs. Our commitment to innovation, service, and trusted partnerships solidifies our strong competitive position.
Another factor that places us in a strong competitive position is that we have an enterprise-wide risk management program that helps us identify and manage inherent risks related to our liquidity, extension of credit and interest rates. Our ownership of WEX Bank provides us with access to low cost sources of capital, which provide liquidity to fund our short-term card receivables. We have maintained a long record of low credit losses due to the short-term, non-revolving credit issued to our customer base. Our credit risk management program is enhanced by our proprietary scoring models, managing credit lines

and early suspension policy. Interest rate risk is managed through diversified funding sources at WEX Bank including interest bearing money market deposits and certificates of deposit with varying maturities. Some of our merchant contracts provide the ability to raise rates if interest rates rise.
Strategy
The Company’s performance during the year ended December 31, 2021, was shaped by our refined corporate strategy and the continued impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our strategy is a simplified articulation of our approach to growing our business and more specifically outlines how we will continue to meet the needs of an evolving landscape.
•Global Commerce Platform. A key foundation to the solutions we deliver to our customers is our platform, through which we deliver the solutions that serve our customers’ businesses. We continue to focus on differentiating ourselves through the global scale and reliability of our underlying infrastructure, and by anticipating our customers’ technology needs. We attempt to do this through integrating and continuously improving our payment and software technologies and by embedding intelligence, agility, and resiliency everywhere across the organization. To drive operational efficiency, we attempt to optimize operations by improving technological capabilities and risk management. To accomplish this, we maximize the value of shared services, streamline and standardize our technologies, and automate whenever possible. 
•Personalized Solutions, Seamlessly Embedded. Through our platform, we deliver a suite of solutions specifically tailored to help our customers tackle some of their most complex pain points. Through our deep industry expertise we try to differentiate ourselves from the market through customer-focused innovation, working alongside customers to ensure our solutions are relevant to their specific needs. One example is the recent expansion of our partnership with ChargePoint, a large electric vehicle (“EV”) charging network, to expand vehicle charging to fleets throughout the U.S. Together, our companies have developed an EV payment system that is integrated into ChargePoint’s existing systems and processes. This allows WEX’s North American fleet customers to pay for charges at sites within ChargePoint’s network, while enabling our customers to manage their EVs in an integrated way with their internal combustion engine fleet vehicles. Going further, we enhance the value we deliver by seamlessly embedding our solutions into our customers’ operations, which enables customers to access our capabilities through systems and interfaces they already use. Going forward, we expect to employ a ChargePoint solution in Europe. These solution enhancements are expected to allow our customers global access to over 200,000 sites in North America and Europe.
•Insights that Power Success. The value of the solutions we provide is further amplified by the insights we deliver through the extensive data we maintain and the specialized expertise of our employees. Through these insights, we enable our customers to make better, more informed decision, move more quickly and mitigate risk. One example is the recent upgrade of our customer servicing platform to enable more automation and utilization of newer, AI technologies to drive better service levels and efficiency. We expect to continue to expand our use of AI, machine learning, and other innovative tools to ensure we can scale with our growth while managing risk both for ourselves and our customers.
While our strategy articulates the choices we are making to grow our business in the market and competitive landscape we play in, we expect those choices to deliver growth across five drivers:
•Win New Customers. We seek to drive organic growth across our segments by nurturing our customer relationships and ensuring we are a trusted strategic partner. We have a robust sales organization to attract new customers and we had key customer wins and renewals in 2021 such as AvidXchange, JB Hunt, the State of California, American Express, one of the largest U.S.-based multinational corporations in package delivery, and a large, higher education institution customer of our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment. Our support and service capabilities continue to enable us to grow with existing customers and win new customers.

•Grow Share of Wallet. We seek to expand our relevance and the value we deliver to our customers by growing the services we provide to them. Through our broad and diverse solution suite, we have a unique combination of solutions that can serve our customers in multiple areas. While we have proven cases of customers consuming our solutions across our product suite, there is continued opportunity to more deeply penetrate our customer base across all our solutions.
Table of Contents

•Expand & Diversify Offerings. We continuously seek to identify, experiment and launch products in new solution spaces. As business models evolve, we seek to adapt our solution suite to stay relevant, and at the forefront of serving our customers’ needs.
•Deepen Global Presence. As a global business, we have an established footprint around the world. Through the scalability of our platform, we seek to leverage capabilities across geographies to continue growing our international business.
•Strategic M&A. Along with our organic growth, we expect to seek to achieve growth through strategic acquisitions, which brings further scale and diversification to our offerings. This past year we continued our work on integrating the eNett and Optal acquisition, which complements our existing travel business by expanding our presence in Europe and entering into new markets in Asia. We also acquired benefitexpress, a provider of highly configurable, cloud-based benefits administration technologies and services to complement our existing health-related offerings.

As of December 31, 2021, WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries had over 5,600 employees, of which approximately 4,800 were located in the United States. None of our U.S.-based employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Certain non U.S.-based employees are members of trade unions or works councils. 
Everything we do is dependent on the talent and culture of our Company. By leveraging our winning, inclusive, and values-based culture, we will mine, grow, and maximize talent that adapts to our future business. We strive to achieve a fully inclusive workplace that unifies and celebrates the diversity of our people. As of December 31, 2021, our global workforce was 45 percent male and 55 percent female, and approximately 18 percent of our workforce in the U.S. were people of color. Females represented approximately 44 percent of our executive officers, while approximately 11 percent of our executive officers were people of color. Females represented approximately 42 percent of our board of directors, while approximately 25 percent of our board of directors were people of color.
Talent, Recruitment and Development, Strategy and Culture
Maintaining our continued growth and position as the global commerce platform that simplifies the business of running a business requires a strategy focused on attracting, developing and retaining exceptional talent. The growth of our people has always been and will always be one of our top priorities. We believe our core values of community, execution, innovation, integrity and relationships differentiate us from our competitors and meaningfully contribute to our growth and business success. Collaboration is essential to doing business and is encouraged and rewarded, as is our culture of curiosity and respectful questioning and direct dialogue. These are essential ingredients to an environment that attracts superior talent and provides the space for innovation that creates business growth.
We take pride in prioritizing and maintaining a positive environment where our employees enjoy their work, respect and support their colleagues, and are encouraged to innovate and collaborate. We foster a culture in which employees are motivated to recognize the value of their contributions—and of our business—to support the growth and development of the communities in which we operate.
We are committed to a core set of shared beliefs and desired behaviors to drive consistency across our organization. Through our Great Leader Behaviors Program, employees are provided a baseline of behaviors and qualities to embody in their daily interactions with colleagues, customers, and partners. It’s not just what we do, but how we do it that matters, and our Great Leader pillars lay the foundation for clear and consistent behavior at all levels. In turn, we are better able to maintain an inclusive, innovative, and collaborative environment for all employees to work, live and thrive.
WEX employees have access to comprehensive training programs, tools and education, including online self-service learning platforms, professional development programs, leadership and mentoring programs, incentives to foster community and engagement, dedicated well-being campaigns, and personal financial counseling. Furthermore, we offer a sabbatical program to rejuvenate and enrich curiosity and personal development. Through these programs, we strive to foster improved individual and business performance, employee engagement, satisfaction and fulfillment. 
Thrive in My Career was designed as a virtual learning resource to help employees be self-sufficient and in control of their own growth and development with a focus on leadership development programs. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, our robust program allowed us to quickly pivot to our online platform and remote resources. We facilitated forums and discussions

to share ideas and best practices on how to work from home, how to lead from a distance, how to lead through disruption and how to maintain resilience.
We care deeply about employee engagement and satisfaction and we capture employee feedback through employee surveys, which measure cultural and engagement indicators. We utilize the survey results to guide our decisions throughout the organization.
We are proud of our talent retention and it is an important component of our talent and management strategy. WEX offers a competitive Total Rewards program for our employees and career development opportunities including access to over 180,000 skill-based training modules. WEX’s robust Total Rewards program includes salary, a 6 percent 401(k) employer match, cash bonuses, and equity awards, as well as health and wellness, career, social, community, and overall well-being benefits. Furthermore, our board of directors and management team regularly evaluate succession planning in order to ensure consistent leadership and growth over time. We actively manage succession plans for our Executive Leadership Team and we are well positioned to have the right talent in place to drive future growth. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At WEX, diversity, equity and inclusion is a strategic priority that is central to our culture, embedded in our values and integral to our business. We are making strides in achieving our vision of a fully-inclusive global workplace that celebrates diversity and fosters a sense of belonging by providing equal access, opportunities and treatment. We embrace our employees’ unique experiences and backgrounds - the cultural influences and identities that make up who we are - to enable a fully engaged and thriving workplace to drive our business forward. Our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, along with our Executive Leadership Team, set the expectations, goals and tone, with all employees playing a role in bringing our diversity and inclusion framework to life. Our global diversity, equity and inclusion framework has four focus areas: workplace (create a culture of inclusion to drive innovation), workforce (build tomorrow’s diverse workforce today), community (embrace the diversity in our communities), and marketplace (provide thought leadership to broaden awareness of diversity and inclusion initiatives). This framework is reflected in the following key ways:
•Our Leadership team’s diversity ensures that a broad range of viewpoints are considered in our strategic and operational practices. As of December 31, 2021, over half of our board of directors and over half of our executive officers were comprised of women or people of color. In addition, women, who are a key part of WEX’s business at all levels, represent over half of our global workforce. 
•Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) are part of our long-term strategy of maintaining an inclusive workplace and community. ERGs serve as a key partner for the recruitment of minority employees, raising diversity awareness across the Company, and driving strategic discussions about employee advancement. Priorities include talent recruiting and retention, professional development, mentorship and skill building, employee engagement and education. We are proud to sponsor ERGs and employees are encouraged to form groups to help support their individual needs, including for example: LatinX, NexGen, WEXPride, WEXVets, Black Growth Council, WEXccessibility, and Women of WEX. In 2021, our ERGs grew to over 1,000 employee members and hosted 75 events with greater than 2,300 attendees.
•Focused recruitment efforts are reflected in our college outreach (1,000+ campuses in 2021). Our recruiting efforts include inner-city schools and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and we require that all recruiting agencies provide us with a diverse slate of candidates. Additionally, during 2021 we engaged in Disrupting Unconscious Bias training with approximately 99+% employee completion to focus on hiring diverse teams and fostering an inclusive environment.
•Internships and early career development introduce young, diverse talent to WEX. Our Summer Internship Program earned a spot on Vault.com’s “100 Best Internships of 2020” and “100 Best Internships of 2021” lists, ranked #15th in “Best Tech & Engineering Internship” in 2021 for Vault.com and was named to WayUp’s list of Top 100 Internship Programs in the U.S. in 2019, 2020 and 2021.
•Retention of diverse and underrepresented talent. We track training, measure diversity, equity and inclusion program outcomes and our inclusive culture’s impact on business results and corporate brand. In conjunction with these efforts, we provide robust benefits, which include good pay and meaningful work.
•Pay equity. WEX is committed to pay equity and conducts global pay equity analyses on an annual basis. WEX strives to ensure that, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, employees earn the same pay for the same work.

In addition, this past year we also released our inaugural Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Report on how we are addressing the ESG impacts that are more important to our investors, employees and communities. We will continue to increase focus and improve public disclosures related to our environmental commitment, diversity and inclusion initiatives, social responsibility, talent management and development, and governance. This will include the release of a new ESG Report during 2022.
Employee Health, Wellness and Safety - COVID-19 and Return-to-Work
We are committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, contractors, and visitors and to ensuring compliance with health and safety regulations. The COVID-19 pandemic created unique challenges that we managed with employee health and safety as the primary objective. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company took a number of precautionary steps to safeguard its business and employees from the effects of COVID-19 including restricting business travel, temporarily closing offices and canceling participation in various industry events. As of the date of this filing, we have implemented the return of limited business travel and allowed limited participation in various industry events. In addition, we have reopened those offices that were closed and all offices have implemented modified safety protocols; although the vast majority of our employees have largely continued to work remotely in most geographies. Further, we have established policies and guidance on vaccines, masking, and social distancing as well as policies and practices for working from home, business travel, returning to offices, and dividing the workweek between home and office. We surveyed employees to determine the ways of work that best suited them and implemented flexible work arrangements. 
Our Health and Safety Policy provides a framework designed to prevent work-related accidents, injuries and illnesses. We provide safety awareness training when onboarding new employees, local emergency evacuation awareness training, and periodic reviews of safety topics. Our Emergency Response Action Plan is reviewed and updated annually. The purpose of this plan is to ensure the protection of all employees in an emergency situation, and it includes emergency evacuation procedures and protocols for how to report various types of emergencies. Our Organizational Resilience Team enlists and trains our authorized Emergency Response Team. Our Incident or Injury Investigation Guidelines establish when, how, and by whom incident and/or injury investigations are processed. The primary focus of such an investigation is to understand why the incident occurred and provide a response within 24 hours of the incident.
We provide competitive and valuable benefits that help our employees thrive while protecting what is most important: health and wellness, families, and overall well-being. Our Total Rewards program consists of five elements: social, health, community, financial, and career, and is designed to support employees in reaching their personal and professional goals. Elements of the Total Rewards program include Company-subsidized health insurance, and fitness facilities along with virtual wellness offerings, recognition programs, paid volunteer time off, and paid time off among other benefits. 
Technology
We believe that investment in technology is crucial to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace. Our technology infrastructure is supported by secure and redundant data centers and cloud services distributed globally, including locations in the United States, Europe, Australia and Singapore. We are in the process of implementing a Cloud First strategy, consolidating our data centers and migrating our computer workloads to public cloud service providers, with the goal of realizing a number of benefits, including reduced energy usage. Through 2021 we have closed 19 data centers out of our target goal of 27 by the end of 2023.
Our fleet fuel-based closed-loop proprietary platforms capture detailed information from the fuel and maintenance locations within our network. Operating a proprietary network not only enhances our value proposition, it also enables us to limit dependence on third-party processors and to respond rapidly to changing customer needs with system upgrades, while maintaining a more secure environment than an open-loop network typically allows. The majority of payments processed on our virtual card open-loop network are through the Company's internally developed software, while a smaller portion are processed using third-party processors. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to minimize downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. At WEX Health, we maintain an integrated multi-account payment platform, including a mobile application. In Australia, Asia Pacific and the United Kingdom, we use standalone platforms to support operations. 
Our Information Security Program consists of a comprehensive set of policies, procedures and guidelines across standard information security domains and all policies are reviewed and updated at least annually to meet applicable federal and state regulations. Our secure networks are designed to isolate our data from unauthorized access. We use secure protocols among all applications, and our employees access critical components on a need-to-know basis. We are continually improving our technology to enhance customer experience and to increase efficiency and security. We also review technologies and 
Table of Contents

services provided by others in order to maintain the high level of service expected by our customers and continue to invest in our technology infrastructure. 
Seasonality
Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For example, in a typical year, fuel prices are typically higher during the summer and online travel sales are typically higher during the third quarter. In addition, we experience seasonality in our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment as consumer spend is correlated with insurance deductibles, typically resulting in higher spend in the early part of the year until employees meet their deductibles.
Resources
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect the proprietary information and technology used in our business. We generally enter into agreements with clients, consultants, service providers and other partners, whether current or prospective, that contain provisions restricting use and disclosure of our proprietary information and technology. Operationally, we have implemented certain safeguards designed to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and technology. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to access or use our proprietary information and technology, and third parties may develop similar and/or competing technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of certain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or plan to operate. We market our products and services using the WEX brand name globally, as well as other brand names such as FleetOne, EFS, and benefitexpress in the U.S. and eNett, Go Card and Motorpass internationally, in Europe, and in Australia, respectively. 
Regulation 
    The Company and its affiliates are subject to a substantial number of laws and regulations, both in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, which apply to businesses offering financial technology services and payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts. In addition, a substantial number of laws and regulations govern insured depository institutions and their affiliates, such as WEX Bank, and our operations in the healthcare market. 
The laws and regulations that apply to the Company and its affiliates are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us is at times unclear. Failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. The following, while not exhaustive, is a description of certain federal and state laws and regulations in the United States, as well as foreign laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business, and therefore can materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. In addition, the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision, and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us. 
Regulation - United States
Exemption from Certain Requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act 
As an industrial bank organized under the laws of the State of Utah that does not accept demand deposits that may be withdrawn by check or similar means, WEX Bank currently meets the criteria for exemption as an industrial bank from the definition of “bank” under the Bank Holding Company Act. As a result, the Company is generally not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Restrictions on Intercompany Borrowings and Transactions 
Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which the Company can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other “covered transactions” with WEX Bank. These rules also require that the Company or any of its affiliates engage in transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. “Covered transactions” include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright ban on engaging in “covered transactions,” they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral.

WEX Inc. and WEX Bank have entered into a master service agreement, which establishes the parameters of services provided between them. Under the agreement, WEX Bank provides the financing and makes credit decisions that enable the Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments to extend credit to customers. WEX Bank approves customer applications, maintains appropriate credit lines for each customer, is the account issuer, and is the counterparty for the customer relationships for most of WEX Inc.’s U.S. programs. WEX Inc. and its other subsidiaries perform operations such as sales, marketing, merchant relations, customer service, software development and IT services.
The Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission Act, and State UDAP Laws 
The Dodd-Frank Act granted the CFPB general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission Act, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce for entities including WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries that are not directly regulated by CFPB. Additionally, all fifty states and the District of Columbia have their own laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and practices, many of which also include a private right of action.
The CFPB is also engaged in regulating the payments industry, including with respect to prepaid cards under Regulation E, which impose requirements on general-use prepaid cards, store gift cards and electronic gift cards. The extensive nature of these types of regulations and the implementation dates for any such additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business and our customers. From an enforcement perspective, the Dodd Frank Act also gives the state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws, expanding the sources of regulatory oversight. Relatedly, the Utah DFI is responsible for examining and supervising WEX Bank's compliance with state consumer protection laws and regulations.
In addition, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. Federal Reserve rules governing debit card interchange fees published in 2011 capped debit card interchange rates at $0.21 per transaction, subject to certain exemptions, plus an additional five basis points (0.0005) times the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. As of December 31, 2021, WEX Bank qualified for the small issuer exemption and was not subject to the debit card interchange fees cap. However, on its balance sheet for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2021, WEX Bank, together with its affiliates, including WEX Inc., surpassed total assets of $10 billion thereby making it ineligible for continued exemption as a small issuer. Accordingly under the terms of the Durbin Amendment, WEX Bank will be subject to the debit interchange cap effective on July 1, 2022. As of the date of this filing, WEX Bank has nominal annual revenue from debit card products that would be subject to the interchange fee cap.
The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. Compliance with derivatives regulations have added costs to our business, and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements or increased regulation of derivative contracts, may add additional costs or may require us to change any fuel price, currency and interest rate hedging practices we may then use to comply with new regulatory requirements. Potential changes could also include clearing and execution methodology of our derivatives transactions. 
Brokered Deposits 
As of December 31, 2021, the most recent FDIC exam report categorized WEX Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) restricts the acceptance of brokered deposits by an insured depository institution unless the institution is “well capitalized.” For insured depository institutions that are “less than well capitalized,” certain interest rate cap restrictions are imposed. 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulations 
The applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence obligations on its local entities. We must verify the identity of customers, monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, and refrain from transacting with designated persons or in designated regions, in each case as required by the applicable laws and regulations (such as the Bank Secrecy Act and regulations of the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service in the United States). Financial regulators have issued various implementing regulations and have made enforcement a

high priority. We have implemented, and will continue to implement, measures designed to comply with these extensive and evolving requirements. 
The U.S. federal government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by OFAC, take many different forms but generally include one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We have implemented, and will continue to implement, measures designed to ensure compliance with these sanctions. 
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
Under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLBA, and certain state laws, we and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to consumer information. This requirement generally does not extend to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. In October 2021, the FTC updated the GLBA Safeguards Rule to specify new safeguards that financial institutions must include in their information security programs, including limits on who can access consumer data, requiring encryption to secure data, and requiring financial institutions to designate a single qualified individual to oversee their information security program and to report periodically to the entity’s board of directors or a senior officer in charge of information security
The GLBA also requires us and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we or WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about consumers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, we and WEX Bank must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to “opt out” of any such disclosure. 
In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will amend and update the CCPA effective January 1, 2023. Under the CPRA, a new California Privacy Protection Agency will issue rules and enforce the revised CCPA. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado adopted their own comprehensive privacy laws, which will take effect in 2023. Several other states are considering privacy legislation during their 2022 legislative sessions. In some cases, these state measures are preempted by federal law such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) or GLBA, for example, but if not, we and WEX Bank must monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our businesses.
In November 2021, U.S. federal banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury, the Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued a final rule effective April 1, 2022, that requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulators of any “computer-security incident” that rises to the level of a “notification incident,” as soon as possible but no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that the incident has occurred.
Email and Text Marketing Laws
We use direct email marketing and text-messaging to reach out to current or potential customers and therefore are subject to various statutes, regulations, and rulings, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders. Several states have enacted additional, more restrictive and punitive laws regulating commercial email. Foreign legislation exists as well, including Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the European laws that have been enacted pursuant to European Union Directive 2002/58/EC and its amendments (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, and The Spam Act 2003 in Australia. Although we believe that our email practices comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, violations could result in enforcement actions, statutory fines and penalties, and class action litigation.
FACT Act
Table of Contents

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts, which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.
Truth in Lending Act
The Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, was enacted as a consumer protection measure to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and to protect consumers from unauthorized charges or billing errors, and is implemented by the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Z. Most provisions of TILA and Regulation Z apply only to the extension of consumer credit, but a limited number of provisions apply to commercial cards as well. One example where TILA and Regulation Z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use, although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability.
Money Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments relating to certain aspects of our business. In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Through our subsidiaries, we are licensed in all states where required for business. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations, which may include a review of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to our business. Following these periodic examinations, state agencies can issue us findings and recommendations, prompting us to make changes to our operations and procedures.
As a licensee, we are subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including net worth and surety bond requirements, record keeping and reporting requirements, requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders or direct and indirect changes of control of the licensee and certain other corporate events, and requirements to maintain certain levels of permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations. Many states also require money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments to comply with federal and state anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 
In addition, non-banks that provide certain financial services are required to register with FinCEN as “money services businesses” (“MSBs”). Through a subsidiary we are registered as an MSB. As a result, we have established anti-money laundering compliance programs that include: (i) internal policies and controls; (ii) designation of a compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training; and (iv) an independent review function. We have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments.
Government agencies may impose new or additional requirements on money transmission and sales of payment instruments, and we expect that compliance costs will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries.
Third Party Administration Licensing Regulations 
We are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations governing third party administration of employee benefit plans. In the U.S., most states license third party administrators. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to third party administration of employee benefit plans and, as part of this authority, may subject us to periodic examinations, which may include a review of our policies and procedures, financial position and related records, and other matters related to our business. Following these periodic examinations, state agencies can issue us findings and recommendations, prompting us to make changes to our operations and procedures. 
As a licensee, we are subject to certain restrictions and requirements, which vary by state, including surety bond requirements and record keeping and reporting requirements. 
Escheatment Laws
We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the United States and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.
Restrictions on Dividends 
Table of Contents

WEX Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Further, a banking regulator may determine that the payment of dividends would be inappropriate and could impose other conditions on the payment of dividends or even prohibit their payment. Further, WEX Bank may not pay a dividend if it is undercapitalized or would become undercapitalized as a result of paying the dividend. Utah law permits WEX Bank to pay dividends out of the net profits of the industrial bank after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due, but if WEX Bank’s surplus account is less than 100 percent of its capital stock, WEX Bank must transfer up to 10 percent of its net profits to the surplus account prior to the payment of any dividends. 
 Company Obligations to WEX Bank 
Any non-deposit obligation of WEX Bank to the Company is subordinate, in right of payment, to deposits and other indebtedness of WEX Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of WEX Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
Restrictions on Ownership of WEX Inc. Common Stock 
WEX Bank, and therefore the Company, is subject to banking regulations that impose requirements on entities that might control WEX Bank through control of the Company. These requirements are discussed in Item 1A under the heading “Provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, applicable banking laws and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.” 
Healthcare Regulation
The federal and state governments in the U.S. continue to enact and consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact various aspects of our health-related business. The plans that our partners and clients administer feature consumer accounts that pay for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees and qualified dependents. These accounts include CDH accounts such as HSAs, FSAs and HRAs, as well as wellness incentives, commuter benefits, and other account-based arrangements. Most of these accounts are tax-advantaged under the appropriate law. 
Employers are continuing to use CDH approaches to manage the rate of increase in healthcare expenditures and to enable employees to make decisions about the use of their healthcare savings. CDH programs provide consumers with visibility into and control over payment for healthcare expenses.
The products that WEX Health’s software and payment solutions support are subject to various state and federal laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “Health Care Reform”), and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and similar state laws and regulatory authorities. As such, changes in the status of tax-advantaged CDH accounts could affect the attractiveness of these products.
In addition to tax-related regulation, the Health Care Reform law imposes coverage standards affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including our relationships with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. Health Care Reform left many details to be established through regulations. Since the enactment of Health Care Reform, there has been persistent political pressure to significantly modify or repeal Health Care Reform and its associated implementing regulations. The 2017 Tax Act repealed certain provisions of Health Care Reform, including reducing to zero the tax penalty for individuals who decline to obtain Health Care Reform-compliant healthcare coverage. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of Health Care Reform, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Such challenges may lead to uncertainty and unpredictability in the U.S. health care market, which may materially affect the availability and cost of health coverage, the viability of health care providers and health benefit plans, and the proportion of persons in the U.S. who have health insurance; the distribution between privately funded and government funded health insurance; and the future demand for, and profitability of, the offerings of our health-related business under our current business model.
In connection with the processing of data, we frequently undertake or are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, GLBA, and similar state and federal laws governing the collection, use, protection and disclosure of nonpublic personally identifiable information, including individually identifiable health information.
Table of Contents

HIPAA and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
