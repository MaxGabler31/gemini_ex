We started our business under the brand of “Sweet Hut” in 2010, the trademark for which registered and will remain valid until March 25, 2020. We established our first outlet in Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We started to manufacture various traditional Chinese desserts such as black glutinous, almond, mango desserts and peanut butter.
 
The name “Sweet Hut” is derived from the word ‘Sweetheart’. Since food is known as the language of love, we’ve decided to use ‘Sweetheart’ as our business’s signature – a dessert hut filled with love, passion & integrity. Sweet Hut aims to please customers by serving creative and exquisite desserts.
 
In 2013, our company was awarded “SME100 Award” by SME & Entrepreneurship Magazine. SME100 Awards is an annual recognition programme organized by SME Magazine, naming the fastest moving businesses of the SME sector. To promote recognition of top businesses in a lucrative and dynamic market, the SME100 Awards has served as a symbol which is believed to distinguish the best among the great.
 
Since 2013, we have grown into a dessert manufacturer and dessert chain under our brand name of “Sweet Hut” in Malaysia. By the end of 2020, the Company decided to shut down all four restaurants operation and re-establish two new restaurants under new concept to strengthen the Company business branding and promoting, together with the launching of menu.
 
We currently operate one centralized kitchen and two restaurants located in Malaysia. We manufacture and process our own dessert and food in our centralized kitchen with standard procedures and recipes, in order to ensure the food quality and safety for distribution. Our suppliers, including raw material, ingredient, packaging material suppliers, are located in Malaysia.
 
Most of our centralized prepared dessert and food will be distributed to our restaurants through our logistic team delivery, via refrigerated trucks. Restaurant is owned and operated by the Company with an internal operational manual in order to comply with all laws applicable to operating a restaurant in Malaysia, which includes, but is not strictly limited to, the Food Act 1983, Food Regulations 1985 and Food Hygiene Regulations 2009.
 
In 2017, due to the increasing number of smartphone users and availability of online food delivery intermediaries, the Company decided to take advantage of such opportunities. On July 4, 2017 and September 18, 2017, the Company, through SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd., which is the restaurant operator, registered as a vendor to Honestbee food delivery and Foodpanda delivery. On November 22, 2018, the Company, through SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd., registered with Grabfood as a vendor. On July 22, 2019, Honestbee food delivery suspended its operation in Malaysia and we stopped our collaboration with Honestbee on the same day. The Company believes registering as a vendor to the aforementioned platforms enables the Company to expand the coverage of availability of all our restaurants despite these platforms charging approximately 30% commission on the total food bill on average.
 
On January 31, 2020, Lucky Star F&B Sdn. Bhd., which is the centralized kitchen operator, has acquired the halal certificate on the food process and production from JAKIM, also known as Department of Islamic Development Malaysia. According to the information from the Department of Statistics Malaysia, as of 2019, the population in Malaysia was approximately 32.6 million, and 69.3% of the population were Muslim adherents. With the halal certificate, we believe the Company can penetrate the Islamic food market in Malaysia, which may lead to improvement in the Company’s financial performance and position.
 
The Company has observed an increasingly competitive environment in the food and beverage industry due to the low barriers to entry and shift in the paradigm of consumer behaviour and preference which the Company believes it is crucial to implement strategic rebranding and marketing activities to cope with industry and consumer demand. For this purpose, in 2020, the Company has closed all of its four restaurants and re-establish two new outlets locating in C180, Cheras and Sri Petaling and engaged branding firm, to advise on our marketing approach including our brand new renovation outlook, dishes and menu with the funding from our public offering.
 
We strongly believe to excel in food and beverage industry, it is crucial to maintain the quality of food served to our customers, regardless of whether that is through food delivery or dine in. To grow our business and build brand awareness it is crucial to improve the Company’s exposure in terms of availability to different locations throughout different towns. Currently, the Company’s potential market is limited to the two towns in which our restaurant is located. Even with the availability of online food delivery platforms, we believe we are unable to attract customers located more than 20 kilometers away from our individual restaurants, which limits to our growth.
