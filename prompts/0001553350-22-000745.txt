Company Overview
 
Pro-Dex, Inc. (“Company,” “Pro-Dex,” “we,” “our,” “us”) specializes in the design, development, and manufacture of autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers used primarily in the orthopedic, thoracic, and craniomaxillofacial (“CMF”) markets. We have patented adaptive torque-limiting technology and proprietary sealing solutions which appeal to our customers, primarily medical device distributors. We also manufacture and sell rotary air motors to a wide range of industries.
 
Our patented adaptive torque-limiting software has been very well received in the CMF and thoracic markets and we have continued investment in this area with research and development focused on applying this technology to other surgical applications.
 
In November 2020, we purchased an approximate 25,000 square foot industrial building in Tustin, California (the “Franklin Property”). This building is located approximately four miles from our Irvine, California headquarters and was acquired to provide us additional capacity for our expected continued future growth. We substantially completed the build-out of the property during fiscal 2022 and we are actively engaged in various verification and validation activities. We anticipate that upon completion of these validation activities, which includes the validation of a new clean room, we will expand our capacity for the manufacture of batteries and new products. We expect that we will begin operations in the new facility during the third quarter of next fiscal year.

Description of Business
 
The majority of our revenue is derived from designing, developing and manufacturing surgical devices for the medical device industry. The proportion of total sales by type is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

 | Years Ended June 30, | 
--------------------------+----------------------+-------
 | 2022 | | | 2021 
 | (In thousands) |

Total Sales | $ | 42,041 | | | 100 | % | $ | 38,029 | | 100 | % 

 
Our medical device products utilize proprietary designs developed by us primarily under exclusive development and supply agreements and are manufactured in our Irvine, California facility, as are our rotary air motors. Our medical device products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers and our air motors are sold primarily to a wide range of distributors and end users.
 
In fiscal 2022, our top three customers accounted for 88% of our sales compared to 91% in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, we had one customer, included in both medical device and repairs revenue above, that accounted for 66% of sales with our next largest customer accounting for 14% of sales. This compares to fiscal 2021, when these same two customers accounted for 58% and 27%, respectively, of our total sales. In many cases, including our largest customers, disclosure of customer names is prohibited by confidentiality agreements with such entities. We have no plans to discontinue the sales relationships with our existing significant customers.
 
Our business today is almost entirely driven by sales of our medical devices. Many of our significant customers place purchase orders for specific products that were developed under various development and/or supply agreements. Our customers may request that we design and manufacture a custom surgical device or they may hire us as a contract manufacturer to manufacture a product of their own design. In either case, we have extensive experience with autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers. We continue to focus a significant percentage of our time and resources on providing outstanding products and service to our valued principal customers. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our largest customer executed an amendment to our existing supply agreement such that we will continue to supply their surgical handpieces to them through calendar 2025 and, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, they executed a product development agreement and related statement of work for our assistance with the next generation of this handpiece. Additionally, we continue to invest in property and equipment as well as personnel to expand our capacity to achieve higher sales volumes.

To that end, we purchased the Franklin Property in November 2020. This building is located approximately four miles from our Irvine, California headquarters and was acquired to provide us additional capacity for our expected continued future growth. We substantially completed the build-out of the property during fiscal 2022 and we are actively engaged in various verification and validation activities. We anticipate that upon completion of these validation activities, which includes the validation of a new clean room, we will expand our capacity for the manufacture of batteries and new products. We expect that we will begin operations in the new facility during the third quarter of next fiscal year.
 
Simultaneously, we are working to build top-line sales through active proposals of new medical device products with new and existing customers. Our patented adaptive torque-limiting software has been very well received in the CMF and thoracic markets. Additionally, we have other significant engineering projects under way described more fully below under “Results of Operations.”
 
The majority of the raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are purchased and are available from several sources, including through our own in-house machining capabilities. Portescap, Fischer Connectors, and Tadiran Batteries are examples of key suppliers. We have no exclusive arrangements with any of our suppliers, but in several instances only one supplier is used for certain high-value components. In most of such instances, secondary suppliers have been identified, although it is likely that any transition to a new or different supplier would result in a delay in the supply chain. We consider our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers to be good, however, during fiscal 2022 many of our suppliers have increased lead times, experienced delays in shipments and raised prices or temporarily added surcharges. We do not intend to terminate any such relationship at this time, nor does management have knowledge that any supplier or manufacturer intends to terminate its relationship with us.
 
Our commitment to product design, manufacturing, and quality systems are supported by our compliance with several regulatory agency requirements and standards. We hold a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Establishment Registration and a State of California Device Manufacturing License (Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch) with respect to our Irvine, California facility. In addition, our Irvine, California facility produces products that are certified to Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC – Annex II, including Conformity Assessment through full Quality Management System (“QMS”) excluding Section 4, which indicates that Pro-Dex QMS meets requirements.
 
At June 30, 2022, we had a backlog of $16.5 million compared with a backlog of $9.7 million at June 30, 2021. Our backlog represents firm purchase orders received and acknowledged from our customers and does not include all revenue expected to be generated from existing customer contracts. Our entire backlog at June 30, 2022, as well as certain purchase orders received subsequent to June 30, 2022, are expected to be delivered during fiscal 2023. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, variability in our new order bookings due to, among other reasons, the launch of new products, the timing of customer orders based on end-user demand, and customer inventory levels. We do not typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our shipments and revenues.
 
Segments
 
We have only one operating segment as our business is currently operated.
 
Competition
 
The markets for products in the industries served by our customers are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, product development, and marketing resources, than us.

-


We compete in all of our markets with other major medical device companies. As a provider of outsourced services, we also compete with our customers’ own internal development and manufacturing groups. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product or new technology introductions by us, our customers’ internal development and manufacturing departments, or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other products targeting the same customers.
 
Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development activities to both maintain and improve our market position. Our research and development efforts involve the design and manufacture of products that perform specific applications for our existing and prospective customers. Our research and development activities are focused on:

● | expanding our knowledge base in the medical device industry to solidify our products with current customers and expand our customer base;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advancing applicable technologies;
--+-----------------------------------


● | introducing new products; and
--+------------------------------


● | enhancing our existing product lines.
--+--------------------------------------

 
In certain instances, we may share research and development costs with our customers by billing for non-recurring engineering services often provided for under development portions of certain contracts. Revenue recognized for non-recurring engineering services represented 2% of our revenue in fiscal 2022 and 1% of our revenue in fiscal 2021.
 
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred research and development expenses amounting to $3.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively, which costs exclude labor and related expenses of approximately $739,000 and $121,000 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, that were reimbursed by our customers through billings for non-recurring engineering services.
 
Human Capital Management
 
Our employees are among our most critical assets. The success and growth of our business depends on our ability to attract, reward, retain and develop talent in all levels of our organization, including, but not limited to, machine operators, assembly technicians, engineers, and management.
 
In order to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we offer the following:
 

· | Competitive, reasonable, and equitable compensation programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Comprehensive and highly competitive health and welfare benefits to promote our employees’ physical health, as well as a 401(k) plan to support our employees’ financial health;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An Employee Stock Purchase Plan and equity compensation to provide financial value, align employee’s interests with those of our shareholders, and incentivize retention;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexible paid vacation and sick time, as well as paid volunteer time; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Education/tuition reimbursement and referral programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

Our employee turnover for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was 14% and 16%, respectively. We consider the turnover rate a valuable metric to measure the effectiveness of our programs and to assist in developing new programs.
 
Employees
 
At June 30, 2022, we had 135 employees, one of whom is part-time, working at either our corporate office in Irvine, California or our Franklin office in Tustin, California and one employee working remotely out of state. At June 30, 2021, we had 118 employees, one of whom was part time, as well as three temporary employees all working at our corporate office in Irvine, California and one employee working remotely out of state. None of our employees are a party to any collective bargaining agreements with us. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Government Regulations
 
The manufacture and distribution of medical devices are subject to state and federal requirements set forth by various agencies, including the FDA, and state medical boards. The statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and advisories that affect our businesses are complex and subject to diverse, often conflicting, interpretations. While we make every effort to maintain full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to eliminate the ongoing risk that one or more of our activities or devices may at some point be determined to be non-compliant. The penalties for non-compliance could range from an administrative warning to termination of a portion of our business. Furthermore, even if we are subsequently determined to have fully complied with applicable laws or regulations, the costs to achieve such a determination and the intervening loss of business could adversely affect or result in the cessation of a portion of our business. A change in such laws or regulations at any time may have an adverse effect on our operations.
 
The FDA designates all medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device (with Class I requiring the lowest level of control and Class III requiring the greatest level of control). The surgical instrumentation we manufacture is generally classified into Class I. The FDA has broad enforcement powers to recall and prohibit the sale of products that do not comply with federal regulations and to order the cessation of non-compliant processes. No claim has been made to date by the FDA regarding any of our products or processes. Nevertheless, as is common in the industry, certain of our products and processes have been the subject of routine governmental reviews and investigations.
 
The total cost of providing health care services has been and will continue to be subject to review by governmental agencies and legislative bodies in the major world markets, including the United States, which are faced with significant pressure to lower health care costs.
 
We believe that our business is conducted in a manner consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other agency regulations governing disposition of industrial waste materials.
 
While we believe that our products and processes fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the outcome of any investigation or review which may be undertaken in the future with respect to our products or processes.
 
Management believes that each of our facilities has manufacturing systems and processes that are based on established Quality Management System standards. In addition, we believe that our Irvine, California facility is compliant with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices promulgated by the FDA and is compliant with applicable ISO standards set forth by the International Organization for Standardization.
 
Patents, Trademarks, and Licensing Agreements
 
We hold US and foreign patents relating to our handheld medical devices and torque-limiting screwdrivers. Our patents have varying expiration dates. The near-term expiration of the patents, if any, is not expected to cause any change in our revenue-generating operations as the revenue from the products associated with those patents is not material.

We have no reason to believe that our activities infringe upon the intellectual property of any third party. With respect to our own patents, we have no reason to believe that our patents are invalid, and we believe that at least some of our patents cover certain aspects of our products. Other than as described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, we are unaware of any reason that would cause us to assert or defend a claim of patent infringement, and such assertion or defense could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations due to the costs involved.
 
We have certain federally registered trademarks relating to our products, including Pro-Dex®, along with a number of other common law trademarks.
 
We have not entered into any franchising agreements. We have not granted, nor do we hold any third-party licenses having terms under which we earn revenue or incur expense in material amounts.
