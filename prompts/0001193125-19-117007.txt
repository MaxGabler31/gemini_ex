Item 1. BUSINESS. 
 Positive Physicians Holdings, Inc. (the Company) is a newly formed Pennsylvania business corporation incorporated on May 1, 2018 for the purpose of acquiring three Pennsylvania based reciprocal insurance exchanges: Positive Physicians Insurance Exchange (PPIX), Professional Casualty Association (PCA), and Physicians Insurance Program Exchange (PIPE). In connection with the completion of the Companys initial public offering, PPIX, PCA, and PIPE converted from reciprocal insurance exchanges into stock insurance companies and merged together to form Positive Physicians Insurance Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Positive Insurance Company). The Companys initial public offering and its acquisition of Positive Insurance Company were completed on March 27, 2019. Prior to that time, the Company had minimal assets and liabilities and had not engaged in any operations. References to Positive Insurance Company financial information in this Annual Report is to the financial information of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE on a combined basis. When used in this Annual Report, we and our mean PPIX, PCA, and PIPE prior to March 27, 2019, and Positive Insurance Company thereafter. 
Positive Insurance Company. 
 Positive Insurance Company writes claims-made, claims-made plus, tail, and occurrence-based medical malpractice insurance for healthcare providers practicing in Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Diversus Management, Inc. (Diversus Management) manages and administers essentially all of the operations of Positive Insurance Company under the terms of a management agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Diversus Management provides such administrative services to Positive Insurance Company in exchange for fees based on a percentage of Positive Insurance Companys gross written premiums, less return premiums. Diversus Management may also earn quarterly performance management fees based on Positive Insurance Companys combined ratio and net earned premiums. Positive Insurance Company remains responsible for all underwriting decisions and the payment of all claims and claims related expenses incurred under policies issued by Positive Insurance Company and for all sales commissions paid to producers. 
 At December 31, 2018, PPIX, PCA, and PIPE had combined total assets of $124.0 million and a surplus of $37.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX, PCA, and PIPE had combined total revenues of $24.6 million and a net loss of $5.4 million. 
 The executive offices of the Company are located at 100 Berwyn Park, 850 Cassatt Road, Suite 220, Berwyn, PA 19312, and its telephone number is 888-335-5335.

 Products and Services 
 Positive Insurance Company underwrites medical professional liability coverage for physicians, their corporations, medical groups, clinics and allied healthcare providers. Medical professional liability insurance protects physicians and other health care providers against liabilities arising from the rendering of, or failure to render, professional medical services. We offer claims-made coverage, claims-made plus, and occurrence-based policies in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Delaware, Maryland, South Carolina and Michigan. Our policies include coverage for the cost of defending claims. Claims-made policies provide coverage to the policyholder for claims reported during the period of coverage. We offer extended reporting endorsements, or tails, to cover claims reported after the policy expires. A claims-made plus policy is a modified claims-made policy combined with an extended reporting endorsement that covers a malpractice claim regardless of when the claim is reported to the insurance carrier as long as the incident occurred within the policy period. Occurrence-based policies provide coverage to the policyholders for all losses incurred during the policy coverage year regardless of when the claims are reported. Although we generate a majority of our premiums from individual and small group practices, we also insure several major physician groups. 
 We offer a single policy form for physicians who are sole practitioners and for those who practice as part of a medical group or clinic. The medical professional insurance for sole practitioners and for medical groups provides protection against the legal liability of the insureds for injury caused by or as a result of the performance of patient treatment, failure to treat, failure to diagnose and related types of malpractice. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 Our marketing philosophy is to sell profitable business in our core states, using a focused, cost-effective distribution system. Our medical professional liability insurance (MPLI) products are currently sold through approximately 81 retail producers in our territories of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Delaware, Maryland, South Carolina, and Michigan. All of these producers represent multiple insurance companies and are established businesses in the communities in which they operate. While we view our insureds as our primary customer, we view our independent insurance producers as important partners because they are in a position to recommend either our insurance products or those of a competitor to their customers. We consider our relationships with these producers to be good. 
 We review our producers annually with respect to both premium volume and profitability. Our producers will be monitored and supported primarily by our marketing employees, who have the principal responsibility for recruiting and training new producers. We hold annual seminars for producers and conduct training programs that provide both technical training about our products and sales training about how to effectively market our products. 
 Producers are compensated through a fixed base commission. Agents receive commission as a percentage of premiums (generally 10% to 12%) as their primary compensation from us. No profit sharing commissions are paid to agents based upon the profitability of the business they produce. 
 Our marketing efforts are further supported by our claims philosophy, which is designed to provide prompt and efficient service and claims processing, resulting in a positive experience for producers and policyholders. We believe that these positive experiences result in higher policyholder retention and new business opportunities when communicated by producers and policyholders to potential customers. While we rely on our independent agents for distribution and customer support, underwriting and claim handling responsibilities are retained by us. Many of our agents have had direct relationships with us for a number of years. 
 Underwriting, Risk Assessment and Pricing 
 Although we are willing to consider physicians in most specialties and classifications for insurance coverage, we recognize that certain specialties present a higher exposure to frequency or severity of claims. Although the number of medical malpractice claims filed in Pennsylvania has decreased significantly since 2008, the severity of the claims brought has not decreased. Accordingly, we rely heavily on individual risk characteristics in determining which medical professionals to whom we will offer coverage.

 Our underwriting philosophy is aimed at consistently generating profits through sound risk selection and pricing discipline. Through the management and underwriting staff of Diversus Management, we regularly establish rates and rating classifications for our physician and medical group insureds based on losses and loss adjustment expense experience that we have developed over the years and the losses and loss adjustment expenses experience for the entire medical professional liability market. We have various rating classifications based on practice location, medical specialty and other liability factors. 
 The nature of our business requires that we remain sensitive to the marketplace and the pricing strategies of our competitors. Using the market information as our background, we normally set our prices based on our estimated future costs. From time to time, we may reduce or increase our discounts or apply a premium surcharge to achieve an appropriate return. Pricing flexibility allows us to provide a fair rate commensurate with the assumed liability. If our pricing strategy cannot yield sufficient premium to cover our costs on a particular type of risk, we may determine not to underwrite that risk. It is our philosophy not to sacrifice profitability for premium growth. 
 We also encourage our insureds to adopt and practice loss reduction methods and loss mitigation practices. Our integrated risk management platform can reduce claims occurring from lack of informed consent, surgical complications, or missed diagnoses. Similarly, required educational sessions for doctors and other medical professionals regarding record keeping, patient follow-up and other basic practices can reduce the frequency of claims. Premium credits are provided to physicians in higher risk specialties who take advantage of these loss reduction methods and loss mitigation practices. Medical professionals who do not commit to these practices and methods can be refused coverage. 
 Our competitive strategy in underwriting is to provide very high-quality service to our producers and insureds by responding quickly and effectively to information requests and policy submissions. Each policy undergoes the entire underwriting process prior to renewal. We maintain information on all aspects of our business, which is regularly reviewed to determine both agency and policyholder profitability. Specific information regarding individual insureds is monitored to assist us in making decisions about policy renewals or modifications. 
 Claims and Litigation Management 
 Our policies require us to provide a defense for our insureds in any suit involving a medical incident covered by the policy. The defense costs we incur are in addition to the limit of liability under the policy. Medical professional liability claims often involve the evaluation of highly technical medical issues, severe injuries and conflicting expert opinions. 
 Our claims management philosophy involves: (i) closure of claims through prompt and thorough investigation of the facts related to the claim; (ii) equitable settlement of meritorious claims; (iii) vigorous defense of unfounded claims as to coverage, liability or the amount claimed; and (iv) the use of mediation and arbitration combined, when appropriate, with agreements with plaintiffs counsel limiting the range of damage awards. Our claims team supports our underwriting strategy by working to provide a timely, good faith claims handling response to our policyholders. Claims excellence is achieved by timely investigation and handling of claims, settlement of meritorious claims for equitable amounts, maintenance of adequate case reserves, and control of loss adjustment expenses. 
 Claims on insurance policies are received directly from the insured or through our independent producers. Our claims department supports our producer relationship strategy by working to provide a consistently responsive level of claim service to our policyholders. Positive Insurance Company is required by applicable insurance laws and regulations to maintain reserves for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported, arising from policies that have been issued. Generally, these laws and regulations require that we provide for the ultimate cost of those claims, subject to our policy limits, without regard to how long it takes to settle them or the time value of money. We are also required to maintain reserves for extended reporting coverage we provide in the event of a physicians death, disability and retirement, or DDR reserves, which are included in our loss reserves as a component of the incurred but not reported, or IBNR, reserves. The determination of reserves involves actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of such claims based on facts and circumstances then known, estimates of future trends in claims severity, and other variable factors such as inflation and changing judicial theories of liability.

 Our actuaries utilize standard actuarial techniques to project ultimate losses based on our paid and incurred loss information, as well as drawing from industry data. These projections are done using actual loss dollars and claim counts. We analyze loss trends and claims frequency and severity to determine our best estimate of the required reserves. We then record this best estimate in Positive Insurance Companys financial statements. Our reserve methodology is discussed in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies. 
 We have contracts with Gateway Risk Services, LLC and Andrews Outsource Solutions LLC, both of which are subsidiaries of Diversus, Inc., (Diversus) under which those companies provide claims processing and risk management services. 
 Technology 
 Diversus Management uses commercially available software to provide the information management systems platform that runs its accounting, policy underwriting and issuance, and claims processing functions. These systems permit Diversus Management to integrate the accounting and reporting functions of our insurance operations. We have adopted a disaster recovery plan tailored to meet our needs and geographic location. A portion of the operations of Diversus Management are managed in a cloud environment using an outside service provider. 
Reinsurance 
 Reinsurance Ceded. In accordance with insurance industry practice, we reinsure a portion of our exposure and pay to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on all policies reinsured. Insurance policies written by us are reinsured with other insurance companies principally to: 

 | reduce net liability on individual risks;
--+------------------------------------------


 | mitigate the effect of individual loss occurrences;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | stabilize underwriting results; and
--+------------------------------------


 | increase our underwriting capacity.
--+------------------------------------

 Under Pennsylvania law, each insured must maintain MPLI of at least $1,000,000 for each claim and $3,000,000 of annual aggregate coverage. We provide primary insurance coverage up to $500,000 per claim and $1,500,000 of annual aggregate coverage. The Pennsylvania Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error (MCARE) Fund provides coverage for any losses above $500,000 per claim up to $1,000,000. In cases where coverage under the Pennsylvania MCARE Fund does not apply, the primary insurance provides coverage up to $1,000,000 per claim and $3,000,000 of annual aggregate coverage. We retain the first $300,000 on all polices and reinsurance covers the excess up to $1,000,000 that is not covered by the Pennsylvania MCARE Fund. Additionally, we provide coverage up to $2,000,000 per claim up to $4,000,000, but cede to reinsurers claims in excess of $1,000,000 up to $3,000,000.
 Other states in which we write insurance require doctors to maintain certain minimum coverage and provide a fund that provides coverage for losses above a certain amount, but many states do not prescribe insurance requirements for doctors. 
 We offer primary coverage up to $1,000,000 for each claim and $3,000,000 of annual aggregate coverage in Maryland, Delaware, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, and South Carolina. We retain the first $300,000 on all polices, and reinsurance covers the excess up to $1,000,000. If an insured in New Jersey requests, we retain the first $300,000 of risk and cede all coverage in excess of that to the reinsurer. 
 We also purchase additional reinsurance coverage for clash, loss in excess of policy limits and extra contractual obligation claims. 
 
5 


 Reinsurance does not legally discharge the insurance company issuing the policy from primary liability for the full amount due under the reinsured policies. However, the assuming reinsurer is obligated to reimburse the company issuing the policy to the extent of the coverage ceded. 
 A primary factor in the selection of reinsurers from whom we purchase reinsurance is their financial strength. Our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually. 
 The insolvency or inability of any reinsurer to meet its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our reinsurance providers, the majority of whom are longstanding partners that understand our business, are all carefully selected with the help of our reinsurance broker. We monitor the solvency of reinsurers through regular review of their financial statements and, if available, their A.M. Best ratings. Hanover Re, our current reinsurance partner, has at least an A rating from A.M. Best. According to A.M. Best, companies with a rating of A or better have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. 
 Reinsurance Assumed. We generally do not assume risks from other insurance companies. However, we are required by statute to participate in certain residual market pools. This participation requires us to assume business for exposures that are not insured in the voluntary marketplace. We participate in these residual markets pro rata on a market share basis, and as of December 31, 2018, our participation was not material. 
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 We are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations to maintain reserves for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reserves are established for both reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR), arising from the policies we have issued. The laws and regulations require that provision be made for the ultimate cost of those claims without regard to how long it takes to settle them or the time value of money. The determination of reserves involves actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of such claims. The reserves are set based on facts and circumstances then known, estimates of future trends in claims severity, and other variable factors such as inflation and changing judicial theories of liability. 
 Estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process. Therefore, the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses does not represent an exact calculation of that liability. Our reserve policy recognizes this uncertainty by maintaining reserves at a level providing for the possibility of adverse development relative to the estimation process. We do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money. For a more detailed overview of our estimation process for reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves. 
 When a claim is reported to us, our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. This estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of our claims staff. In estimating the appropriate reserve, our claims staff considers the nature and value of the specific claim, the severity of injury or damage, and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss, to the extent determinable at the time. Case reserves are adjusted by our claims staff as more information becomes available and discovery progresses. It is our policy to settle each claim as expeditiously as possible. 
 We maintain IBNR reserves to provide for already incurred claims that have not yet been reported and developments on reported claims. The IBNR reserve is determined by estimating our ultimate net liability for both reported and IBNR claims and then subtracting the case reserves and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses for reported claims. 
 Each quarter, we compute our estimated ultimate liability using principles and procedures we have developed over several years. However, because the establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process, we cannot assure you that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss reserves. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made.

 The estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or anticipated to be settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or anticipated to be settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable or adverse development).

 At December 31, 2018, the average maturity of our fixed maturity investment portfolio was 4.09 years and the average duration was 3.41 years. As a result, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, we may experience investment losses to the extent our liquidity needs require the disposition of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate environments. 
 Our average cash and invested assets, net investment income, and return on average cash and invested assets for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):

 We use quoted values and other data provided by independent pricing services as inputs in our process for determining fair values of our investments. The pricing services cover substantially all of the securities in our portfolio for which publicly quoted values are not available. The pricing services evaluations represent an exit price, a good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale. The pricing is based on observable inputs either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are active, quoted prices for similar securities at the measurement date, or other inputs that are observable. Additionally, our investments in limited partnerships are priced based upon audited financial statements of the respective limited partnerships. 
 The investment manager provides us with pricing information that we utilize, together with information obtained from independent pricing services, to determine the fair value of our fixed maturity securities. After performing a detailed review of the information obtained from the pricing service, no adjustment was made to the values provided for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 Competition 
 The medical professional liability insurance market is highly competitive. We compete with stock and mutual insurance companies, risk retention groups (RRGs), reciprocal exchanges, and other underwriting organizations. Our largest competitors in Pennsylvania are PMSLIC/NORCAL Mutual Insurance Company, MedPro Group, Central Pennsylvania Physicians Risk Retention Group, and Medical Mutual of North Carolina. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and operating resources than we do and may be able to offer lower rates to policyholders or higher commissions to their producers. 
 We compete on a number of factors such as pricing, agency relationships, policy support, claim service, and market reputation. Like other writers of MPLI, our policy terms vary from state to state based on the maximum prescribed limits in each state, as established by state law. We believe our company differentiates itself from many larger companies competing for this business by focusing on service and responsiveness. 
 To compete successfully in the MPLI industry, we rely on our ability to: identify insureds that are most likely to produce an underwriting profit; operate with a disciplined underwriting approach; practice prudent claims management; and provide services and competitive commissions to our independent agents. 
 Regulation 
 General. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, particularly at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state, but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to state insurance regulatory agencies who may then promulgate regulations. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products, not the companies that write the policies. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including accounting methods, agent and company licensure, claims procedures, corporate governance, examinations, investing practices, policy forms, pricing, trade practices, reserve adequacy and underwriting standards. 
 State insurance laws and regulations require Positive Insurance Company to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere we do business, and the operations of Positive Insurance Company and its respective accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Positive Insurance Company prepares statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania generally conforms to National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) practices and procedures, so its examination reports and other filings generally are accepted by other states.

 Premium rate regulation varies greatly among jurisdictions and lines of insurance. In the states in which Positive Insurance Company writes insurance, premium rates for the various lines of insurance are subject to either prior approval or limited review upon implementation. Positive Insurance Company intends to apply for approval to act as a surplus lines carrier in those states where it believes sufficient business opportunities make providing surplus lines coverage to physicians and other healthcare providers in those states attractive. Positive Insurance Company also intends to apply for approval to act as a reinsurer in those states where it believes sufficient business opportunities exist to provide quota share insurance to RRGs that are attractive acquisition targets. 
 Examinations. 
 Examinations are conducted by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department every three to five years. Past examinations did not result in any adjustments to our financial position. In addition, there were no substantive qualitative matters indicated in the examination reports that had a material adverse impact on our operations. 
 NAIC Risk-Based Capital Requirements. 
 Pennsylvania and most other states have adopted the NAIC system of risk-based capital requirements that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based formula. These risk-based capital requirements attempt to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a companys mix of products and investment portfolio. Under the formula, a company first determines its authorized control level risk-based capital. This authorized control level takes into account (i) the risk with respect to the insurers assets; (ii) the risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the insurers liabilities and obligations, (iii) the interest rate risk with respect to the insurers business; and (iv) all other business risks and such other relevant risks as are set forth in the risk-based capital instructions. A companys total adjusted capital is the sum of statutory capital and surplus and such other items as the risk-based capital instructions may provide. The formula is designed to allow state insurance regulators to identify weakly capitalized companies. 
 The requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention. The company action level is triggered if a companys total adjusted capital is less than 2.0 times its authorized control level but greater than or equal to 1.5 times its authorized control level. At the company action level, the company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve the capital position. The regulatory action level is triggered if a companys total adjusted capital is less than 1.5 times but greater than or equal to 1.0 times its authorized control level. At the regulatory action level, the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed. The authorized control level is triggered if a companys total adjusted capital is less than 1.0 times but greater than or equal to 0.7 times its authorized control level; at this level the regulatory authority may take action it deems necessary, including placing the company under regulatory control. The mandatory control level is triggered if a companys total adjusted capital is less than 0.7 times its authorized control level; at this level the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control. The capital level of Positive Insurance Company has never triggered any of these regulatory capital levels. We cannot assure you, however, that the capital requirements applicable to Positive Insurance Company will not increase in the future. 
 NAIC Ratios. 
 The NAIC also has developed a set of 11 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios. If four or more of its IRIS ratios fall outside the range deemed acceptable by the NAIC, an insurance company may receive inquiries from individual state insurance departments. 
 Enterprise Risk Assessment. 
 In 2012, the NAIC adopted the NAIC Amendments. The NAIC Amendments, when adopted by the various states, are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the United States. One of the major changes is a requirement that an insurance holding company systems ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an enterprise risk report that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are 
 
12 


  likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Beginning in 2016, Pennsylvania required insurers domiciled in Pennsylvania to include an enterprise risk assessment in its annual report. Other changes include requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of its divestiture of control, having detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates and expanding of the agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator. In addition, in 2012 the NAIC adopted the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act. The ORSA Model Act, when adopted by the various states, will require an insurance holding company systems chief risk officer to submit at least annually to its lead state insurance regulator a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurers current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Although Positive Insurance Company is exempt from ORSA because of its size, Positive Insurance Company intends to incorporate those elements of ORSA that it believes constitute best practices into its annual internal enterprise risk assessment. 
 Market Conduct Regulation. 
 State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. 
Guaranty Fund Laws. 
 All states have guaranty fund laws under which insurers doing business in the state can be assessed to fund policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Under these laws, an insurer is subject to assessment depending upon its market share in the state of a given line of business. For the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX, PCA, and PIPE incurred total assessment expense in the amount of $36,000 pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. 
 Positive Insurance Company establishes reserves relating to insurance companies that are subject to insolvency proceedings when it is notified of assessments by the guaranty associations. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments on Positive Insurance Company under these laws. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Federal Regulation 
 The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may impact the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of reinsurance companies. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office which is authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the insurance industry and to recommend that the Financial Stability Oversight Council designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the U.S. financial stability in the event of the insurers material financial distress or failure. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office issued a report on alternatives to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. Changes to federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in federal taxation, can also significantly impact the insurance industry and us. 
 We are also subject to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, or FACTA, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPPA, both of which require us to protect the privacy of our customers information, including health and credit information.

 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
 Enacted in 2002, the stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We became subject to most of the provisions of the SOX immediately after completion of our initial public offering. 
 The SOX includes very specific disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules and requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related regulations. 
 Privacy. 
 As mandated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, states continue to promulgate and refine laws and regulations that require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to take steps to protect the privacy of certain consumer and customer information relating to products or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes. A recent NAIC initiative that affected the insurance industry was the adoption in 2000 of the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation, which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of customer information. We have implemented procedures to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Acts related privacy requirements. 
OFAC. 
 The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) maintains a list of Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the SDN List). The SDN List identifies persons and entities that the government believes are associated with terrorists, rogue nations or drug traffickers. OFACs regulations prohibit insurers, among others, from doing business with persons or entities on the SDN List. If the insurer finds and confirms a match, the insurer must take steps to block or reject the transaction, notify the affected person and file a report with OFAC. 
 JOBS Act. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, such as reduced public company reporting, accounting and corporate governance requirements. We currently intend to avail ourselves of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following March 27, 2019, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 
 In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.

 Dividends. 
 Pennsylvania law sets the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by an insurance company during any twelve-month period after notice to, but without prior approval of, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. This amount cannot exceed the greater of 10% of the insurance companys surplus as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, or the insurance companys statutory net income for the period covered by the annual statement as reported on such statement. The amount available for payment of dividends by Positive Insurance Company in 2019 without prior approval is approximately $3.7 million. Extraordinary dividends in excess of the foregoing limitations may only be paid with prior notice to, and approval of, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. No dividends were paid for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Holding Company Laws. 
 Most states, including Pennsylvania, have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish certain information. This includes information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company group that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. Pursuant to these laws, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department requires disclosure of material transactions involving an insurance company and its affiliates, and requires prior notice and/or approval of certain transactions, such as extraordinary dividends distributed by the insurance company. Under these laws, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department will have the right to examine us and Positive Insurance Company at any time. 
 All transactions within our consolidated group affecting Positive Insurance Company must be fair and equitable. Notice of certain material transactions between Positive Insurance Company and any person or entity in our holding company system will be required to be given to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Certain transactions cannot be completed without the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. 
 Approval of the state insurance commissioner is required prior to any transaction affecting the control of an insurer domiciled in that state. In Pennsylvania, the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurer or its holding company is presumed to be a change in control. Pennsylvania law also prohibits any person or entity from (i) making a tender offer for, or a request or invitation for tenders of, or seeking to acquire or acquiring any voting security of a Pennsylvania insurer if, after the acquisition, the person or entity would be in control of the insurer, or (ii) effecting or attempting to effect an acquisition of control of or merger with a Pennsylvania insurer, unless the offer, request, invitation, acquisition, effectuation or attempt has received the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.
