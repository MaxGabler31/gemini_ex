Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes," "project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

PRODUCT LINE

ENDO BRANDS

The easiest and most effective way to get your daily CBD, CBN or Delta-8 supplementation. These daily drops are blended with amazing essential oils for a great taste. You can take them either directly or mix them into your favorite beverage. There is even a peanut butter flavored drop for your pet. We recently introduced “Endo on the Go” Delta-8 drops that you can slip into your pocket and purse and take with you just about anywhere!

ENDO Ease

Topical Pain relief product, it is our Endo Select Hemp Oil used as either a warming lotion, cooling lotion or salve.

ENDO Tokes

Our ENDO Tokes products are a range of products made for people who would rather smoke their CBD or Delta-8. The original ENDO Toke is a pre-rolled CBD flower that comes in the shape of a cigarette. The product is, however, tobacco free and has less than 0.30% THC so it won’t get you high, but it is a quick delivery system for CBD. In addition, in 2021, the company has introduced a line of Delta-8 infused disposable and rechargeable vape pens as well as Delta-8 flower in jars or pre-rolled for quick consumption. All of these products are designed to give multiple choices to our customers who like to consume CBD and Delta-8 by smoking something.

ENDO Gummies

For people that don’t like to ingest CBD or Delta-8 by smoking, we have a line of gummies. Currently, we sell three different types of gummies: 1) CBD; 2) CBD & Melatonin; and 3) Delta-8.
