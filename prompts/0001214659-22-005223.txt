ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History of Our Company
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 29, 1998 under the name Weston International Development Corporation to conduct any lawful business, to exercise any lawful purpose and power, and to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Laws of Nevada. On July 28, 1998, its name was changed to Txon International Development Corporation.
 
On August 14, 2000, pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated August 10, 2000, by and among Main Edge International Limited (“Main Edge”), Virtual Edge Limited (“Virtual Edge”), Richard Ford, Jeanie Hildebrand and Gary Lewis, we acquired from Main Edge all of the shares of Virtual Edge (the “Acquisition”) in exchange for an aggregate of 1,961,175 shares of our common stock, which shares equaled 75.16% of Txon International’s issued and outstanding shares after giving effect to the Acquisition. On September 15, 2000, Txon International Development Corporation changed its name to China World Trade Corporation (“CWTD”).
 
On March 28, 2008, CWTD entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) by and among CWTD, William Tsang (“Tsang”), Uonlive Limited, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Hong Kong SAR of the People’s Republic of China (“Uonlive”), Tsun Sin Man Samuel, Chairman of Uonlive (“Tsun”), Hui Chi Kit, Chief Financial Officer of Uonlive (“Hui”), Parure Capital Limited, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and parent of Uonlive (“Parure Capital”).  Upon closing of the share exchange transaction contemplated under the Exchange Agreement, Tsun and Hui transferred all of their share capital in Parure Capital to CWTD in exchange for an aggregate of 150,000,000 shares of common stock of the Registrant and 500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Registrant, which is convertible after six months from the date of issuance into 100 shares of common stock of the Registrant, thus causing Parure Capital to become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant.
 
On July 2, 2008, the proposal to amend the articles of incorporation to change the name of the corporation to Uonlive Corporation was approved by the action of a majority of all shareholders entitled to vote on the record date and by CWTD’s Board of Directors. CWTD desired to change its name to truly reflect its new business as a holding company for Uonlive Limited, and possibly other companies that may be acquired in the future by the company (the “Company” or “Uonlive”).
 
On May 15, 2009, the Company approved the 1 for 100 reverse split of its common stock.
 
The Company initially ceased operations in early 2015. The Company has fully impaired all assets since the shutdown of its operations in 2015 and recorded the effects of this impairment as part of its discontinued operations.
 
On May 2, 2017, Parure Capital was struck off the BVI Register of Companies for non-payment of annual fees. Therefore, Parure Capital was no longer a subsidiary of the Company.
 
On June 15, 2018, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Small Cap Compliance, LLC (“Custodian”) as custodian for Uonlive Corporations., proper notice having been given to the officers and directors of Uonlive Corporation. There was no opposition.
 
On June 20, 2018, the Custodian appointed Rhonda Keaveney as CEO, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of the Company.
 
On August 7, 2018, the Company filed a certificate of reinstatement with the state of Nevada.
 
On September 7, 2018, the Company authorized the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Series B Preferred Stock. Each one Convertible Series B Preferred Stock was entitled to be converted into 1,000 shares of common stock. Also, each one Convertible Series B Preferred Stock was entitled to 1,000 votes of common stock. 150,000 shares of Convertible Series B Preferred Stock were issued to Chuang Fu Qu Kuai Lian Technology (Shenzhen) Limited giving Chuang Fu Qu Kuai Lian Technology (Shenzhen) Limited the voting control of the Company. 
 Also on September 7, 2018, Raymond Fu was appointed as President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and member of our Board of Directors of the Company and Rhonda Keaveney resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Secretary, and member from the Board of Directors.

On April 10, 2019, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement, the Company contracted to acquire 80% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Truly Organic Limited, a Hong Kong based company (“Truly Organic”), specializing in organic agriculture certification consulting in South East Asia. However, Truly Organic was unable to provide financial statements capable of being audited by a PCAOB independent public accountant, as required in the Acquisition Agreement. Therefore, such acquisition did not close.
 
On January 13, 2020, Edwin Lun, the existing secretary of the Board of Directors resigned. On January 13, 2020, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation. Also on January 13, 2020, (i) Timothy Chee Yau Lam was appointed and consented to act as the new secretary of the Board of Directors and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) Kwok Fai Thomas Yip was appointed and consented to act as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, and (iii) Chi Wai Michael Woo was appointed and consented to act as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Corporate Structure
 


On March 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Definitive Share Agreement whereby Mr. Raymond Fu, the sole shareholder of Asia Image Investment Limited, relinquished all his shares in Asia Image and acquired 100,000 shares of the Company.

As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has no source of revenues and needs additional cash resources to maintain its operations. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed elsewhere, our current business plan is to seek and identify a privately-held operating company desiring to become a publicly held company by combining with us through a reverse merger or acquisition type transaction. We cannot predict when, if ever, we will be successful in this venture and, accordingly, we may be required to cease operations at any time, if we do not have sufficient working capital to pay our operating costs for the next 12 months and we will require additional funds to pay our legal, accounting and other fees associated with our Company and its filing obligations under United States federal securities laws, as well as to pay our other accounts payable generated in the ordinary course of our business.
 
On October 27, 2020, the Company appointed AJSH & Co LLP, a PCOAB registered firm as its independent registered accounting firm who performed the Company’s audit for the period ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
 
AJSH & Co LLP also performed the audit for Asia Image Investment Limited for the periods ended December 31 2019, and December 31, 2018.
 
Business Overview 
 
Previously, our main business had been operating an online radio station targeted at younger audience. However, we are in the period of transitioning into operating our business to the tea industry and international trade of commodities. We are a trading, distribution, and consultancy company with experience in China products with a focus on tea planting and sales, research and development. The company’s business scope includes partnering with tea plantations for tea production, such as Dongguan Gongxiang Tea Food Company Ltd and sales as well as agricultural tourism. Our production is focused primarily in pu-er tea.
 
We have experience in the China market and can leverage off that experience to bring together the various traditional products with customers using e-distribution channels. Our revenue streams are generated from the sale of such products throughout China.
 
We are expanding our business model by connecting traditional products through e-channels and using technological innovation as a driving force to connect end users to increase sales. The company intends to continuously expand the market share in the various products that it is involved in. It is committed to grow into one of the larger market players in the sphere.
 
We seek to grow our business by pursing the following strategies:

Industry Overview
 
The tea industry in China is a thriving market. The aggregate Revenue in the industry amounts to USD 92,684,000,000 of sales as at April 2020 and is expected to grow annually by 5.8%1.
 
Pursuant to statista.com, tea is the most consumed hot drink worldwide and the most consumed non-alcoholic beverage overall. It is especially important in Asia and Eastern Europe as well as in the United Kingdom. It serves the purpose of both caffeination and hydration. In China, tea has a much higher degree of prestige with upscale specialty products. Depending on the quality of the tea, a kilogram of tea in China can go for upwards of USD 100,0002.

Given the prevalence of tea in China, combining it together with e-distribution channels can increase the industry growth and sales of the product.
 
Our Strategy
 
We intend to modernize and enhance the experience of China products by distributing our products through e-distribution channels. In addition to tea, the company plans on expanding into other areas and industries such as poultry breeding and sales, fruit seedling planting and sales.
 
Our business objective is to generate revenues based on the sale of the products and to maintain and grow a customer base based upon our internal database.
 
Our target market is the China consumer market as well as corporate clients. Given the importance of tea culture within China, being a consumable, this product becomes a staple for meetings in board rooms and at home as an everyday product.
 
The Company seeks to leverage management’s experience to expand its consumer base, starting with corporate clients.
 
Potential competitors 
 
There will be an abundance of competitors in the market, given the highly competitive environment we operate in, from both existing competitors and new market entrants. The Company’s competitors include Urban Tea Inc., Maiji (“麦吉”), Luosennina (“罗森尼娜”), NAYUKI (“奈雪的茶”), and Chayanyuese (“茶颜悦色”), all of which are located in the Hunan province. However, given that this is a consumable product that is used daily, the market should able to absorb all such products.
 
Products
 
Currently our tea plantation partners offer a wide range of tea drinks. The products are focused on not only their taste but also their aesthetic presentation and health benefits. Our products are currently being offered via our managed stores. The product is produced, packaged and ready for consumption by our tea plantation partners in China. 
 
Our goal is to be a leading brand of tea beverages in each city in which we currently and intend to operate, by selling the finest quality tea beverages and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a pleasant and comfortable environment. The current products being offered by our tea plantation partners are being sold in Fujian, in China.
 
The main product being sold is Yunnan Chi Tse Beeng Cha, which is a type of pu-er tea.
 
Seasonality
 
The industry for the sale of tea-based beverages goes through a peak season from April to October, while the rest of the year is off-season. Moreover, seasonality includes adverse weather conditions and ordering during festive seasons, specifically Chinese New Year, where many of the factories may be closed. We have implemented a few measures to mitigate the impact of such seasonal fluctuations in sale, such as taking reserve stock to be sold during the off-season. As pu-er tea can be aged, keeping pu-er tea stock not only increases our inventory, but is also a good investment for later sales.

Management, Culture and Training
 
We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes customer service and the importance of delivering optimal performance.
 
Passion for Tea. We seek to recruit, hire, train, retain and promote qualified, knowledgeable and enthusiastic business partners who share our passion for tea and strive to deliver an extraordinary retail experience to our customers.

· | Extensive Training. We have specific training and certification requirements for potential business partners, including undergoing food handlers’ certification and foundational training. This process helps ensure that all team members educate our customers and execute our standards accurately and consistently. As team members progress to the assistant manager and manager levels, they undergo additional weeks of training in sales, operations and management.

Business and Strategic Partners
 
Currently, we are strategically aligned with Dongguan Gongxiang Tea Food Company Ltd, which is a tea plantation in Fujian that supplies the products mentioned above.
 
Licenses, Permits and Government Regulations
 
PRC Legal System
 
The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on the PRC Constitution and is made up of written laws, regulations and directives. Unlike in the US where the law built partly upon decisions of common law cases, court cases in the PRC do not constitute binding precedents. The governmental directives are organized in the following hierarchy.
 
The National People’s Congress of the PRC (“NPC”) and the Standing Committee of the NPC are empowered by the PRC Constitution to exercise the legislative power of the state. The NPC has the power to amend the PRC Constitution and to enact and amend primary laws governing the state organs and civil and criminal matters. The Standing Committee of the NPC is empowered to interpret, enact and amend laws other than those required to be enacted by the NPC.
 
The State Council of the PRC is the highest organ of state administration and has the power to enact administrative rules and regulations. Ministries and commissions under the State Council of the PRC are also vested with the power to issue orders, directives and regulations within the jurisdiction of their respective departments. Administrative rules, regulations, directives and orders promulgated by the State Council and its ministries and commissions must not be in conflict with the PRC Constitution or the national laws and, in the event that any conflict arises, the Standing Committee of the NPC has the power to annul such administrative rules, regulations, directives and orders.
 
At the regional level, the people’s congresses of provinces and municipalities and their standing committees may enact local rules and regulations and the people’s government may promulgate administrative rules and directives applicable to their own administrative area. These local laws and regulations may not be in conflict with the PRC Constitution, any national laws or any administrative rules and regulations promulgated by the State Council.
 
Rules, regulations or directives may be enacted or issued at the provincial or municipal level or by the State Council of the PRC or its ministries and commissions in the first instance for experimental purposes. After sufficient experience has been gained, the State Council may submit legislative proposals to be considered by the NPC or the Standing Committee of the NPC for enactment at the national level.
 
Governmental Regulations in Relation to the Company’s Businesses
 
Regulations Related to Retail
 
There are no separate mandatory legal provisions on the retail business model in the PRC. Companies and individual businesses may engage is the retail business as long as they have registered with the commerce departments in accordance with the laws such as the Regulation on Individual Industrial and Commercial Households and Administration of the Registration of Enterprises As Legal Persons, and include “retail” in the business scope on their business license. 
Seasonality
 
We believe our operation and sales do not experience seasonality.
