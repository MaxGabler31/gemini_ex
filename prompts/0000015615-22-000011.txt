Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 
Opportunities in our Communications Segment
Significant advances in technology and rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers continue to increase demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. The amount of network data traffic is experiencing significant and accelerating levels of growth from increased usage of mobile devices, advancements in the “Internet of Things (IoT)” and a significant increase in the use of mobile and remote technologies, an existing trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased data usage is expected to significantly increase data traffic, resulting in the need for new and upgraded networks. Contributing to the increase in data usage are video and streaming technologies, ‘smart’ technologies, including ‘Smart City’ and ‘Smart Home’ applications, artificial intelligence and other advanced data services, including video surveillance, robotics, drones, digital health applications and autonomous vehicles, among others. Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) predicts that broadband connection speeds in North America will more than double by 2023, from approximately 55 Mbps in 2018 to over 140 Mbps in 2023, according to its March 2020 Annual Internet Report, 2018-2023.
According to Deloitte & Touche LLP’s (“Deloitte”) 2021 Outlook for the US Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment Industry publication, in 2020, US telecommunications networks were key in driving changes in how people live, work and learn amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and helped to mitigate the pandemic’s negative effects by keeping people and communities connected. The publication predicts that telecommunications providers will serve as the bedrock for the ability of businesses to recover and thrive by continuing to enable new modes of communication. Telecommunications companies are projected to have an even larger role in shaping the future as next generation 5G wireless technology gains traction among both businesses and consumers. 5G, the next generation of wireless and fixed wireless network capacity, is expected to provide a platform for the IoT, which can be harnessed to drive innovation and improvements in commerce, transportation, supply chain, research, healthcare, education, public safety, the development of Smart Cities, Smart Homes and Smart Farming, among many other applications. 5G is expected to provide businesses with significant real-time visibility, insight and control over assets, products and services, with the potential to transform how businesses operate and deliver new products and services.
In response to these growing opportunities, communications service providers (“CSPs”) are expanding, densifying and optimizing current wireless and wireline/fiber communications network capacity, while initiating a build-out of 5G infrastructure. To achieve nationwide coverage levels, changes to the structure of the network architecture for 5G wireless communications will require a longer period of installation when compared to past generation changes in wireless infrastructure. In order to maintain performance standards as 5G is built-out, CSPs will need to undertake targeted strategic improvements to their 4G legacy networks by upgrading 4G core infrastructure alongside 5G deployment areas. Cisco, in its Annual Internet Report, predicts that 5G devices and connections will be over 10 percent of global mobile devices and connections by 2023. Large scale 5G deployments, which are expected over the next several years, will include additional and improved tower capacity, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small/micro cells, distributed antenna systems and fiber network expansion to densify network performance.
We believe that nationwide 5G tower deployments, including the impact of recently available C-band and mid-band spectrum, deployment of small/micro cells and fiber network expansion by major carriers in support of 5G will lead to significant demand for 5G telecommunications infrastructure over multiple years. A December 2020 report by Grand View Research indicated that the global 5G infrastructure market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of almost 60% from 2020 to 2027, and a September 2020 publication by Boston Consulting Group projects that U.S. telecommunications companies will invest over $250 billion to build 5G networks from 2020-2025. In August 2020, the Federal Communications Commission’s (the “FCC”) initiatives to speed deployment of 5G technology in the United States through the Facilitate America’s Superiority in 5G Technology, or “FAST” Plan, were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The FAST Plan is designed to make more spectrum available to the market and encourage implementation of and investment in 5G technology across the United States by streamlining regulatory processes and updating infrastructure policies. Mid-band spectrum is considered to be ideal for 5G infrastructure, as it is viewed to provide the optimum mix of speed and coverage for 5G. The FCC has recently completed multiple auctions, and is expected to continue to have auctions to make mid-band spectrum available for 5G wireless, IoT and other advanced spectrum-based services.
Several initiatives designed to drive development of telecommunications and 5G infrastructure in rural areas are also underway. The Connect America Fund (“CAF”) program is designed to improve the quality and expand the availability of high-speed internet service in rural areas, and in January 2020, the FCC announced its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”), which is a follow-up initiative to the CAF program. RDOF will make over $20 billion in funding available over the next 10 years to build and connect gigabit broadband speeds in unserved rural areas. Additionally, in October 2020, the FCC established the 5G Fund for Rural America, which will provide up to $9 billion in funding over the next decade to bring 5G wireless broadband connectivity to rural America. In addition, in November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJ Act”) was signed into law, which provides for funding in many of the markets we serve, including approximately $65 billion to improve and expand the nation’s broadband infrastructure and to make broadband more affordable for low-income Americans. 
The market for Smart City initiatives, in which cities use IoT technologies to collect and use insights gained from data to manage city assets, resources and services more efficiently, is a developing trend that is expected to accelerate due to the combination of increased data speeds and data capacity capabilities of wireless and wireline networks and developing IoT applications. To address the expected escalating demands for resources of so many residents living, working, driving and interacting with each other, cities are looking at ways to become ‘smarter’ and more efficient in responding to these needs, including through Smart City initiatives to address and improve traffic flow, public safety and energy efficiency. According to CTIA’s Smart Cities Playbook, smart lighting solutions have the potential to save more than $1 billion per year across the United States and smart traffic management systems have the potential to reduce congestion by 40% and save $100 million annually. Forbes Magazine in 2019 estimated that two-thirds of cities globally are investing in Smart City technologies, including such technologies as Wi-Fi kiosks, smart lighting solutions, utility meters, smart traffic management systems, video sensors, weather sensors, drone sensors for public safety efforts and radio frequency identification sensors in the pavement. According to Mordor Intelligence’s “Smart Cities Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact and Forecasts (2022-2027),” the Smart Cities market was valued at approximately $740 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at an estimated compound annual growth rate of approximately 18% from 2021 through 2026.
Smart Home technologies represent a wide range of solutions for monitoring, controlling and automating functions in a home. These technologies are expected to benefit from the global rollout of 5G and improvements in Wi-Fi technologies, which are revolutionizing the delivery of IoT services. According to Mordor Intelligence’s Global Smart Home Market 2020-2025 report, the demand for smart home solutions is expected to increase significantly as consumers look to add smart home technologies such as connected cameras, video doorbells and security systems, lighting and energy management solutions and entertainment controls. Mordor Intelligence predicts that the Smart Home market will grow from approximately $80 billion in 2019 to approximately $224 billion in 2025. We believe that opportunities for installation and maintenance of both Smart City and Smart Home technologies will provide our install-to-the-home group opportunities for future growth, providing an offset to declining trends in subscribership for satellite TV.
We believe that we are well-positioned, as one of the largest providers of communications infrastructure services, to substantially benefit from the expected multi-year significant and broad opportunities in the telecommunications market as previously described.
Opportunities in our Clean Energy and Infrastructure Segment
Climate change initiatives and the desire to reduce carbon emissions continue to gain momentum, driving trends in the mix of fuel sources used in energy generation toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. According to Deloitte’s Industry Outlooks 2021: Power, Utilities & Renewables report, businesses, states, cities and utilities have announced decarbonization plans, with many utilities and their customers announcing and accelerating plans to fully decarbonize over the next three decades. Demand for clean energy sources continues to grow, with renewables reporting rising levels of usage and capacity as well as declining costs. Potential new governmental and policy initiatives could drive even further growth in renewable energy infrastructure, and it is expected that the transition to a renewable energy economy will require rapid transformation of the power sector and significant investment. According to a January 2021 publication by BloombergNEF, global investment in low-carbon energy transition projects totaled $501 billion in 2020, with renewables totaling $304 billion of the total global 2020 investment, for which wind and solar were the primary drivers. The recently passed IIJ Act includes funding for renewable energy innovation and deployment. Included within the $65 billion allocated to power infrastructure and energy programs is funding for: fuels and technology investment, including various carbon initiatives; 
clean energy technology supply chains, including battery power initiatives; solar energy research and development; and the development and deployment of hydrogen from clean energy sources, among others. 
Growing corporate initiatives for smaller, standalone distributed generation facilities, together with regulatory and other policy initiatives at the federal, state and municipal levels, have spurred demand for clean energy production from sustainable power sources, including electrical power production from renewable sources such as wind, solar and biomass. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”) or renewable energy goals, with five states updating or adopting new clean energy standards in 2021. States have created these standards to diversify their energy resources, promote domestic energy production and encourage economic development. According to Deloitte’s 2021 Renewable Energy Industry Outlook, rising state renewable portfolio standards, increasing levels of corporate and residential demand, and improving economic competitiveness of renewable sources continue to be key drivers for their growth, with potential future federal policy initiatives, mandates and stimulus providing additional growth drivers. Renewable energy policies have helped to drive the U.S. market for wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. According to BloombergNEF’s January 2021 publication, U.S. investment in renewable energy capacity approximated $49 billion in 2020. In addition, growing efforts to address electric grid resiliency are expected to drive growth in renewables, as utilities and their customers increasingly consider renewable microgrids combined with energy storage solutions to support critical facilities.
In 2020, renewable energy production experienced record-high levels of penetration. According to the July 2021 Monthly Energy Review by U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), renewable sources generated a record number of kilowatt hours of electricity in 2020 in the United States, second only to natural gas. Wind, currently the most prevalent source of renewable electricity in the United States, grew 14% from 2020, and solar grew 26% from 2020 for utility-scale solar generation, and 19% for small-scale solar generation. The EIA noted in its January 2022 Short-Term Energy Outlook that one of the most significant shifts in the mix of U.S. electricity generation over the past 10 years has been the rapid expansion of renewable energy resources, especially solar and wind. The amount of solar power generating capacity operated by the U.S. electric power sector at the end of 2021 is 20 times more than it was at the end of 2011, and U.S. wind power capacity is more than twice what it was 10 years ago. In its January 2022 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA forecasts that most of the growth in U.S. electricity generation in 2022 and 2023 will come from new renewable energy sources, and according to a January 2022 EIA article, solar is expected to account for nearly half of new additions in 2022. The Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Annual Energy Outlook 2021 projects that renewable electric generating technologies, such as wind and solar, are expected to represent 60% of new capacity additions through 2050 due to a combination of declining capital costs, expected increases in state RPS targets and current and potential tax incentives. Renewable power generation is expected to contribute over 40% of U.S. power generation capacity by 2050, with solar and wind projected at 47% and 34%, respectively, of the total renewable power generation mix in 2050. Advancing technologies and improvements in cost and scalability of renewable energy projects are making these energy sources increasingly viable. 
As a result of the trends and factors discussed above, we expect a continuing increase in demand for construction of renewable infrastructure in the coming years. In addition, we believe that replacement and repowering of existing wind turbines and foundations with next generation, higher efficiency turbines, as well as maintenance of aging wind farms, will provide increased opportunities for wind infrastructure projects.
We believe that industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries, including in the renewable energy industry, as power companies explore ways to reduce their carbon footprint. We expect that the need for baseload backup power generation, coupled with the relative low price and environmental advantage of cleaner burning natural gas will continue to drive demand for gas-fired electrical generating plants and conversions of coal-fired power plants to natural gas. According to the EIA’s January 2022 Short-Term Energy Outlook, another significant shift in the mix of U.S. electricity generation has been a steady decline in the use of coal-fired power plants since their peak output in 2007 and the increasing use of natural gas. A wide variety of industries may seek to expand, convert or construct new plants to take advantage of this economical, cleaner, lower cost and lower carbon fuel source. Biofuel and biomass as alternative fuel sources also present opportunities for the renewable energy market. Industrial facilities and power plants in the biofuels/biomass, food processing, natural gas and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed. 
We also provide heavy civil infrastructure construction services, including the construction and maintenance of buildings, roads, bridges, water/sewer systems and other civil infrastructure. We believe that initiatives to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure, along with potential governmental stimulus programs and other policy incentives, will lead to increased investment and future growth opportunities in this area. The IIJ Act includes approximately $110 billion of funding for roads and bridges, including $40 billion of funding for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation and $16 billion of funding for other major infrastructure projects, as well as approximately $50 billion of funding for water infrastructure, including for weatherization efforts to reduce the impact of climate change and to protect against droughts and floods.
We are one of the leading renewables contractors in North America, with expertise in wind, solar and biomass, as well as construction of industrial and other power plants and heavy civil infrastructure, and we expect to benefit from market trends in these industries.
Opportunities in our Power Delivery Segment
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure (the “grid”) is composed of a network of electric generating facilities, high voltage transmission lines, substations and distribution lines that bring power to homes and businesses. The grid will continue to require significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to continue delivery of reliable and affordable power. This will include strengthening aging infrastructure, addressing future grid resiliency and modernization efforts (“Smart Grid”) and adapting to changing energy supply, population shifts and distribution requirements, including the impact of the shift toward electric vehicle technologies. According to a June 2021 IBIS World report, U.S. industry revenue for construction and repair work on electric power transmission infrastructure is projected to approximate $43.5 billion in 2021. We expect future growth in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure from projects to digitize, modernize, harden and secure the grid against increasing levels of disruption from natural and man-made disasters, including extreme weather events, wildfires and potential cyber-attacks, as well as to address changing energy supply requirements and grid reliability. The IIJ Act includes approximately $65 billion for upgrades to power infrastructure, research and development of transmission and electricity distribution technologies and smart grid technologies. The funding 
is focused on grid reliability and security, renewable energy innovation and deployment, and ensuring supply chains critical for energy innovation. The IIJ Act also includes $7.5 billion for investment in a national network of electric vehicle chargers. 
Clean energy production trends are expected to lead to increased investment in electric infrastructure, with a changing fuel mix that is moving toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as natural gas and renewables. Deloitte’s 2021 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook reported intermittent record-high levels of renewable energy production in 2020. Additionally, the report indicated that many utilities and their customers announced plans to fully decarbonize over the next three decades. These trends, along with potential changes in governmental policy toward national net zero carbon emission targets, are expected to drive significant future investment in electric infrastructure. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2021, the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by renewable sources is expected to double to over 40% by 2050. Renewable electric generating technologies are expected to represent 60% of new capacity additions through 2050, with the balance coming almost entirely from natural gas. The expected growth in electrical power generation from renewable energy sources will require significant investment in transmission lines, as wind, solar and other renewable power generation resources are typically located in remote areas of the country, far from industrial users and major population centers. Growth in electrical power generation from renewable sources in the U.S. will also require grid updates to provide for storage of electricity from renewable energy sources and capabilities that can accommodate supply and demand for these new energy sources.
Future demand for electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure is also expected to result from ‘Smart Utility’ initiatives, which seek to address growing populations, environmental goals and the need to optimize resources, as well as electric vehicles, as consumers and automakers increasingly shift toward electric vehicle technologies.
According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2021, approximately 760 net gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity are expected to be added in the U.S. through 2050, requiring significant investment in transmission and distribution by electric utility companies. We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will continue to be required to meet the above-mentioned needs, and that we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.
Opportunities in our Oil and Gas Segment
We are one of the largest pipeline contractors in North America, with a balanced portfolio of service offerings, including union and non-union services. Our pipeline offerings include the construction and maintenance of large diameter (“long-haul”) pipeline, midstream pipeline, gathering lines and related compressor, pumping stations and treatment plants, as well as gas utility distribution services and pipeline integrity maintenance, including replacement and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure. 
Disruptions in economic activity and regulatory actions have reduced overall demand and U.S. production of fossil energy products, negatively affecting demand for oil, natural gas and product pipeline construction activity. While we expect that energy consumption, demand and U.S. production will increase in the future based on current commodity prices and economic activity, the related cost, time and complexity of pipeline construction projects has increased due to the impact of regulatory, judicial and environmental challenges and governmental actions. The effect that these trends may have on future pipeline project awards, or the timing of future project work, is uncertain. 
We expect that natural gas power generation will remain a fuel of choice for both primary power generation and baseload backup power generation to support intermittent clean energy sources, and that this trend will drive the growth of natural gas as a source of base load lower-carbon power generation, both in the U.S. and abroad. We believe that trends in natural gas power generation will require continued construction of pipeline infrastructure to provide fuel safely and efficiently to these facilities. In addition, demand for liquified natural gas (“LNG”) exports has risen in recent years. This trend is expected to drive construction of pipeline infrastructure for the transport of LNG to coastal export facilities in North America. Additionally, we believe that gas utility distribution spending for replacement and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure will accelerate over the next several years due to regulatory, sustainability and safety concerns. Similarly, we expect that aging pipeline infrastructure will increasingly require replacement lines and pipeline integrity services as our customers look to enhance the safety, productivity and lives of existing infrastructure. In addition, developing trends in decarbonization and carbon emission reductions are expected to create demand for carbon capture technologies. Pipeline infrastructure is expected to play a key role in this transformation and we believe that we are well positioned to support these developing market trends. The recently passed IIJ Act includes funding for carbon initiatives, including for carbon capture technologies.
We believe that the above-mentioned trends will support continued levels of future project activity across multiple service offerings we provide and that we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

Environmental Stewardship
We believe that we all play a role in environmental stewardship. We help our customers find solutions to their environmental goals and requirements and are likewise committed to responsibly managing the environmental impacts of our operations. Our customers rely on our expertise with governmental and regulatory agencies to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. Environmental matters are an integral part of our business planning and decision-making processes. We believe in sustainable development and are committed to integrating biodiversity preservation principles into our operational practices. Our corporate policies and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics require that all applicable environmental regulations and compliance requirements are met in the course of our operations. Our planning processes incorporate procedures to ensure compliance with all such laws and regulations. 
Climate change mitigation and environmental initiatives. We are committed to minimizing the effects of our operations on the climate and the environment and endeavor to reduce our carbon footprint, energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. We seek to foster conservation and environmental awareness within our operations, and we endeavor to identify and incorporate energy, carbon and water efficiency considerations into our project planning and execution. We understand the importance of tracking and managing climate-related matters, including greenhouse gas emissions. We are evaluating processes that will enable us to measure and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities on an enterprise-wide basis. We have implemented GPS, smart idling and other advanced technologies in approximately 75% of our vehicle fleet operations to improve fleet efficiency, fuel consumption and safety. Additionally, certain of our operations have invested in equipment containing advanced emissions reduction technologies, helping to reduce our carbon footprint.
Community and Social Matters
At MasTec, we are proud to serve the communities in which we operate. Partnering with our communities and our customers is fundamental to our business operations. We plan and act for the future, for the long-term good of our company, our customers and our communities. We are active in our local communities and participate in charitable giving, community outreach and community building programs, including disaster relief efforts for communities affected by hurricanes, flooding and similar events. We also have an unwavering commitment to our team members in times of need. In addition to community outreach programs, we seek to develop strong relationships with our local communities, businesses, subcontractors and suppliers, and we have been recognized for our efforts in community and outreach programs by various organizations.
We place a significant priority on respectful collaboration with our local communities, including indigenous communities, and we utilize indigenous community subcontractors and suppliers within our operations. We support our local communities by utilizing local businesses for goods and services, including for project crews and office operations, and we are active members of our local chambers of commerce and economic development organizations. Our community outreach programs include programs tailored to military veterans, who represent approximately 3% of our workforce.
Leadership and Governance
Integrity, honesty, and fairness are at the heart of our Company. Our leadership team and Board of Directors are committed to fostering a strong organizational culture built upon accountability, business and personal ethics, integrity and compliance. We believe that an ethical culture builds credibility and trust. We hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards of professionalism, and respect the opinions, ideas and perspectives of our team members, customers, subcontractors, suppliers and those in the communities we serve. Among the ethical matters addressed in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are our policies on discrimination and harassment, ethical and fair business practices and compliance with insider trading policies, anti-bribery and anti-corruption guidelines and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Training programs related to governance matters are routinely provided at intervals based on an employee’s position and responsibilities. We also expect our subcontractors and suppliers to maintain proper business conduct and ethics protocols.
Governance Principles and Shareholder Alignment. We seek to align the interests of our Board of Directors and management with those of our shareholders and other stakeholders, and we believe that an independent, well-diversified Board is an essential attribute of effective Board governance. Diverse backgrounds are integral to effective governance, risk management and business opportunity assessments, which are key components of creating long-term value. Our Board has racial, ethnic and gender diversity, with approximately 60% of our Board representing women or minorities as of December 31, 2021. Our Board also has a diverse skill set, including members with financial, risk management, health and safety and industry expertise. 
Our management team and our Board of Directors have significant ownership in MasTec’s common stock, which further aligns their interests with those of our other shareholders.  Our single class capital structure is grounded on the “one-share, one-vote” principle, which we believe is aligned with strong corporate governance standards. We have detailed governance procedures, including our Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter and our Nominating, Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee Charter. These charters, as well our comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Board of Director Governance Principles, can be viewed on the “Investors” page of our website at MasTec.com.
Risk Mitigation Practices. We believe that responsible corporate governance requires great attention to potential business and other risks. As part of our corporate risk mitigation strategy, we regularly assess potential risks and hazards within our business and operations, including potential risks associated with climate change. Risk assessments are performed on an ongoing basis at both the organizational and at the project level. We also apply a risk-based approach with respect to cyber security. We are committed to the privacy of employee, customer and company information and undertake significant efforts to protect this information. We continually evaluate cyber risks to properly safeguard our systems and business operations.
Sustainability and Climate-Related Governance. The Nominating, Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of sustainability-oriented matters for MasTec, including overseeing MasTec’s approach to considering, evaluating and integrating climate-related risks and opportunities into its business strategy and decision-making processes. This Committee is also responsible for considering MasTec’s material sustainability issues, discussing associated risks with the full Board and management and reviewing and considering whether MasTec has appropriate policies, processes, strategies and initiatives in place to address such matters, including climate-related risks and opportunities. The potential implications and financial impact of the climate-related risks and opportunities remains uncertain, but we recognize that these risks and opportunities could be significant to our business. We regularly assess our business risks and opportunities, and we are working to develop our process to assess the potential effects and magnitude of climate-related risks and opportunities on our operations, financial results and key business strategies, as guided by the recommendations of the TCFD.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Focus on Growth Opportunities. We believe that our end-markets offer multiple growth opportunities, and we expect continued spending by key customers in many of the industries we serve. We expect development of wireless and wireline/fiber infrastructure; development of clean energy infrastructure; expansion, maintenance and upgrades of power delivery infrastructure, including electrical and gas transmission lines and distribution networks; development of pipeline infrastructure, including carbon capture technologies and pipeline integrity work; and heavy civil and industrial infrastructure construction projects to be areas of investment and opportunity in the coming years. We intend to use our broad geographic presence, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, customer relationships and full range of services to capitalize on these trends and grow our business. 
Operational Excellence. We seek to effectively manage our projects and services to maintain appropriate profit margins and cash flows. We also strive to identify opportunities for leverage within our business, such as deploying resources across multiple customers and projects in order to enhance our operating effectiveness and utilization rates. We also seek to maintain strong working capital management practices. Our management team pursues actions and programs designed to achieve these goals, such as increasing accountability throughout our organization, effectively managing customer contract bidding procedures, evaluating opportunities to improve our working capital cycle time, hiring and retaining experienced operating and financial professionals, and developing, expanding and integrating the use of financial systems and information technology capabilities within our business.
Maintain Conservative Capital Structure. We evaluate our capital structure on an ongoing basis and have expanded our financial resources in recent years. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $0.7 billion of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, with aggregate borrowing commitments of $2.0 billion under our new unsecured senior credit facility, and $600 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2028. We may consider opportunities to borrow additional funds, or to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources,” for details pertaining to recent capital structure activities.
Leverage Core Performance and Expertise through Strategic Acquisitions and Other Arrangements. We pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic arrangements that allow us to expand our operations, service offerings, customer base or geographic reach. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisitions. For discussion of our recent acquisitions, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business,” which is incorporated by reference. In our efforts to maximize the potential of the businesses we acquire, we work to integrate them into our operations and internal control environment in a timely and efficient manner. We evaluate our business and operations on a regular basis, and from time to time, we may divest certain businesses or assets or curtail selected business activities or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin or those that no longer fit within our long-term business strategy.
Services
Our core services are the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of infrastructure, primarily for communications, power generation, utility and pipeline customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 
Build. We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cell towers, fiber, cable and power lines that provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; clean energy infrastructure, including for renewable energy power generation; pipeline infrastructure, including for natural gas and other product transport; power delivery services, including electrical and gas transmission and distribution systems; heavy industrial plants; compressor and pump stations and treatment plants; water and sewer infrastructure, including water pipelines; and other civil construction infrastructure.
Install. We install electrical and gas distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic and other cables, and provide various install-to-the-home products and services, including home automation and energy management solutions in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers’ hardware, software and network equipment.
Maintain and Upgrade. We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers’ distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including communications, power generation, pipeline, electrical distribution and transmission and heavy civil infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for service restoration following natural disasters and accidents. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls.
Customers
We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For the year ended December 31, 2021 revenue derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements totaled 38% of consolidated revenue, and for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled 36%. 
The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs requiring the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an entire infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, the timing of which is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Under the typical payment terms of master and other service agreements and contracts for specific projects, the customer makes progress payments based on quantifiable measures of performance as defined in the agreements. Some of our contracts include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount (generally, from 5% to 10% of billings) can be retained by the customer until final contract settlement. 
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for customer concentration information. 
Backlog
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. Based on current expectations of our customers’ requirements, we anticipate we will realize approximately 75% of our estimated year-end 2021 backlog in 2022. The following table presents 18-month estimated backlog by reportable segment as of the dates indicated:

Reportable Segment (in millions): | December 31, 2021 | | September 30, 2021 | | December 31, 2020
Communications | $ | 4,504 | | | $ | 4,469 | | $ | 3,806
Clean Energy and Infrastructure | 1,543 | | | 1,570 | | | 1,025
Oil and Gas | 1,027 | | | 1,166 | | | 2,486
Power Delivery | 2,865 | | | 1,318 | | | 557 
Other | — | | | — | | | — 
Estimated 18-month backlog | $ | 9,939 | | | $ | 8,523 | | $ | 7,874

As of December 31, 2021, 63% of our backlog is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer, regulatory or other delays or cancellations, including from economic or other conditions, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary and/or COVID-19 effects or climate-related matters, and/or other project-related factors. These effects, among others, could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. We occasionally experience postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements and/or construction projects due to changes in our customers’ spending plans, market volatility, changes in governmental permitting, regulatory delays and/or other factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or if actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 
Backlog is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Backlog differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. As of December 31, 2021, total 18-month backlog differed from the amount of our remaining performance obligations due primarily to the inclusion of $6.6 billion of estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements within our backlog estimates, as described above, and the exclusion of approximately $1.6 billion of remaining performance obligations and estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements in excess of 18 months, which amount is not included in the backlog estimates above. Backlog expected to be realized in 2022 differs from the amount of remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized for the same period due primarily to the inclusion of approximately $3.5 billion of estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements that is included within the related backlog estimate.
Sales and Marketing
Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers’ demands. Through our unified MasTec® brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of our services, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec® service mark and other service marks. 
We have a business development and marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec® registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate business development organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. We also market our services in conjunction with certain business partners, strategic investments and arrangements. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national and international level. 
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We have a proactive safety culture and we strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees. Our employees are required to participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We actively train our workforce in everyday safety practices and provide detailed guidelines that are required to be followed as work tasks are contemplated and completed. Training programs are tailored to an employee’s job function, responsibilities and level of experience and are designed in accordance with industry best practices and standards. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Team members are responsible for preventing incidents, injuries and occupational illnesses, and our project leadership team is tasked with ensuring that projects are accomplished in a safe, productive, environmentally and quality-focused manner. Our business units have established robust safety programs to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations, and through our risk management programs, we educate our staff, subcontractors and suppliers on safety matters. We strive continuously to assess and improve our safety programs and performance. We also provide Company-wide training for other workplace and risk management programs, including for cyber security, workplace diversity and harassment, emergency preparedness and other potential workplace hazards, among others. 
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. We 
also maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims, which is subject to annual per employee maximum losses. We are required to post collateral to certain of our insurance carriers, generally in the form of letters of credit, surety bonds and cash. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of, those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent on any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage. 
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, including the spending patterns of our customers and the effects of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work, both of which can influence the timing of spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,” which is incorporated by reference. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms, including Quanta Services, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Primoris Services Corporation, Pike Electric, Inc., Bechtel Corporation, M.A. Mortenson Company, Black & Veatch and Nexius.
Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, safety record and reputation for customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process, and price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight. 
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations, among them: 
•    regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents; 
•regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”); 
•    contractor licensing requirements; 
•    permitting and inspection requirements;
•    building and electrical codes; and
•cyber data protection and security.
We are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species and critical habitats. In particular, our pipeline-related activities require careful adherence to environmental regulations because such operations may have impacts on groundwater, surface waters and other environmentally sensitive areas. Similarly, our power delivery construction operations often require us to operate in remote areas involving environmentally sensitive habitats as well as areas that are subject to risk of wildfire.
We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes fuel. Any changes in laws requiring us to use equipment that runs on alternative fuels could require a significant investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. 
In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur unanticipated and substantial costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters. We believe 
we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory and environmental requirements. We could, however, incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such requirements.
Additionally, there are significant environmental regulations under consideration to address climate change, regulate emissions of greenhouse gases and encourage the use of clean energy technologies. We regularly monitor proposed regulations and legislation and have processes in place to adapt our business and operations, as necessary, to meet any such new requirements.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
We operate primarily in the United States and Canada. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Human Capital Management
At MasTec, our employees are an integral part of our growth and success. MasTec began as a family business, and every member of the MasTec team is considered part of the MasTec family. The safety, health and welfare of our employees is at the heart of our operations. We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace and value the diverse and varied perspectives and experiences of our employees. We believe that our commitment to our employees, together with our team culture, fosters an environment of strong employee engagement. When our employees are safe, healthy and engaged, we are most productive. We believe that our employees and our customers benefit from the collective and well-coordinated efforts that result from effective employee engagement, teamwork and collaboration, which, in turn, allows us to deliver the highest level of excellence to our stakeholders. 
For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021, we had an average of approximately 25,000 employees, of which approximately 5,000 were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements, and as of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 27,000 employees, of which approximately 7,000 were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 97% of our employees are located in the U.S.
Safety. Safety is a core value at MasTec. It is a mindset that permeates all aspects of our operations, and an attitude that our employees exhibit, strongly and openly. We recognize the need of our workforce to have a safe workplace and are committed to maintaining a strong and sustainable safety culture within our organization. We continually evaluate our safety programs to protect our most important asset – our team members. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges in many parts of our business and operations, including with respect to keeping our employees safe. Accordingly, we adjusted our standard operating procedures within our business operations to ensure employee and customer safety and continue to monitor evolving health guidelines and respond to changes as appropriate. We have also developed human resource guidance to assist our employees with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We have a proactive safety culture, and our safety leadership structure is designed to create accountability within each of our businesses and at the corporate level. Our safety management process includes continuously monitoring, reporting and addressing our key safety performance indicators. Our “Zero Harm” culture is fundamental to our goal of world class safety performance, and we work to instill safety values in every team member, such that safe behavior becomes instinctive and automatic. We are driven by our commitment to safety and our “Zero Harm” culture to develop and implement safety programs and processes with safety excellence as our goal. We strive continuously to improve our safety performance and provide regular safety training and skill-level improvement programs, including: safety orientation for new employees, safety leadership training for our front-line leaders, OSHA construction outreach training, defensive driving and DOT training, operator qualification and electric worker training, excavation and ground penetration safety training, among others. We have adopted numerous safety initiatives throughout our organization, including fleet telematics applications. 
Through our risk management programs and other safety initiatives, we educate our staff, subcontractors and suppliers on safety matters. The high standards of safety, incident prevention and hazard control that we expect within our operations are also expected of our subcontractors and suppliers. We have memberships and participate in numerous safety and other organizations that promote industry safety. Our safety performance is periodically recognized by our customers as well as by safety organizations.
Health and Wellness. Encouraging good health and following a healthy lifestyle is a MasTec philosophy. We encourage all our employees to take an active role in living a healthy lifestyle and offer wellness tools and resources to help achieve and maintain good health. We offer a comprehensive and flexible benefits program, including medical, dental, vision and prescription insurance, as well as access to telehealth services, which we have expanded in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to assist employees with medical and mental health matters. In addition, to help our employees build a financially secure future, we offer a 401(k) plan with matching benefits, an employee stock purchase plan, life and disability insurance plans and a flexible spending account to help employees cover medical expenses. We also offer employees support for personal and work-life issues, including health, legal and financial matters.
Professional and Career Development. We believe that professional development is essential to the success of our business, as it drives employee engagement and ensures that our team members have the requisite skills and training to deliver the highest level of excellence to our customers. An employee’s career development begins with the onboarding process and continues throughout the employee’s career. Ongoing training is designed to develop an employee’s technical, professional and leadership skills and is customized to meet the qualifications and requirements necessary for our employees to succeed in their positions. We invest significant resources in education, certification, training programs, and other professional development opportunities, including apprenticeship- and leadership-oriented training programs, tuition reimbursement for qualified training programs, sponsored attendance at industry conferences, departmental and divisional leadership conferences, employee training centers and advancement opportunities within and across businesses and divisions. We seek to develop and cultivate current and future leaders, and design our training programs to create high performing teams, improve productivity, positively affect employee motivation and retention and further enhance career development opportunities. We believe that our team culture, along with competitive salary and benefits packages and our focus on employee training and career development, including opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, helps us to attract and retain a diverse and experienced workforce.
Team Culture, Diversity and Inclusion. Our success depends upon the success of our team, which requires us to have exceptional team members, as well as an exceptional team. Teamwork is part of our culture and is one of our core values. We believe that our employees and our customers benefit from the collective and well-coordinated efforts that result from effective employee engagement, teamwork and collaboration. We seek to foster an environment of strong employee engagement through our commitment to our employees and our team culture. A strong team culture, together with effective processes and people, allows us to consistently meet the needs of our customers and stakeholders. 
We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to fostering an environment where our employees can freely bring diverse perspectives and varied experiences to work. We seek to attract the best talent and foster a culture of inclusion, teamwork, support and empowerment where all talented individuals have access to opportunities and can achieve success. Our commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, together with our culture of belonging allows us to recruit and retain highly talented employees so that we are able to deliver exceptional results to our customers. In 2021, 49% of our overall U.S. workforce and 48% of our U.S. executive, manager and professional workforce was represented by women and minorities. 
Certain of our businesses have incorporated the use of annual diversity assessments and goal setting targets to expand diversity within our management and employee teams, and we expect to continue in these efforts. A notable portion of our workforce includes military veterans, and we regularly engage in outreach programs tailored to military veterans.
